abstract={Cyber-attacks that tamper with measurement information threaten the security of state estimation for the current distribution system. This paper proposes a cyber-attack detection strategy based on distribution system state estimation (DSSE). The uncertainty of the distribution network is represented by the interval of each state variable. A three-phase interval DSSE model is proposed to construct the interval of each state variable. An improved iterative algorithm (IIA) is developed to solve the interval DSSE model and to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the interval. A cyber-attack is detected when the value of the state variable estimated by the traditional DSSE is out of the corresponding interval determined by the interval DSSE. To validate the proposed cyber-attack detection strategy, the basic principle of the cyber-attack is studied, and its general model is formulated. The proposed cyber-attack model and detection strategy are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems. Comparative experiments of the proposed IIA, Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, and interval Gauss elimination algorithm prove the validation of the proposed method.},

abstract={The growing number of attacks against cyber-physical systems in recent years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four classical classification models based on network data and host system data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this approach detects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.},

abstract={State estimation plays a critical role in maintaining operational stability of a power system, which is however vulnerable to attacks. False data injection (FDI) attacks can manipulate the state estimation results through tampering the measurement data. In this paper, a cyberphysical model is proposed to defend against FDI attacks. It judiciously integrates a physical model which captures ideal measurements, with a generative adversarial network (GAN) based data model which captures the deviations from ideal measurements. To improve computation efficiency of GAN, a new smooth training technique is developed, and an online adaptive window idea is explored to maintain the state estimation integrity in real time. The simulation results on IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that our defense technique can accurately recover the state estimation data manipulated by FDI attacks. The resulting recovered measurements are sufficiently close to the true measurements, with the error lower than 1.5e-5 and 2e-2 p.u. in terms of voltage amplitude and phase angle, respectively.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new way of thinking that characterizes itself by uniting two entities, namely state estimation in the smart grid (SG) and cognitive dynamic system (CDS). False data injection (FDI) attacks are a family of new attacks that have been considered to be the most dangerous cyber-attack as it leads to cascaded bad decision making throughout the SG network, which can lead to severe repercussions. The conventional state estimation and bad data detection techniques, which have been applied to reduce observation errors and detect bad data in energy system state estimators, cannot detect FDI attacks. Here, we bring into play an objective-seeking system to act as the supervisor of the SG network. To this end, we propose to introduce a new metric for the SG: the entropic state. The entropic state has two purposes: 1) it provides an indication of the grid's health on a cycle-to-cycle basis and 2) it can be used to detect FDI attacks. Consequently, improving the entropic state is the goal of the supervisor. To achieve that objective, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the state estimation process by reconfiguring the weights of the sensors in the network. With optimality in mind, the CDS is the superior choice for the supervisory system. In this structure, the CDS interacts with the SG network, which is considered as the environment. Computer simulations are carried out on a 4-bus and the IEEE 14-bus systems to highlight the performance of the proposed approach in detecting both bad data and FDI attacks in the SG, respectively.},

Attackers develop different methods to manipulate different systems, not only cyber security components, but also image detection systems. Therefore, securing machine learning models has become critical. In this paper, we demonstrate a data poisoning attack towards classification method of machine learning models and we also proposed a defense algorithm which makes machine learning models more robust against data poisoning attacks.

abstract={Machine learning models are vulnerable to a variety of data perturbation. Recent research mainly focuses on the vulnerability of model training and proposes various model-oriented defense methods to achieve robust machine learning. However, most of the existing research overlooks the vulnerability of model capacity, which is more fundamental for model performance. In this paper, we study an adversarial vulnerability of model capacity caused by the poisoning on the estimation of model hyper-parameters. We further implement this vulnerability catering for the polynomial regression model, on which the evading of model-oriented detection is challenging, to illustrate the effectiveness of the adversarial vulnerability. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and three real-world data sets demonstrate that the vulnerability can effectively mislead the hyper-parameter estimation of the polynomial regression model by poisoning a few numbers of camouflage samples that cannot be detected by model-oriented defense methods.},

abstract={Modern Process Control Systems (PCS) exhibit an increasing trend towards the pervasive adoption of commodity, off-the-shelf Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This has brought significant economical and operational benefits, but it also shifted the architecture of PCS from a completely isolated environment to an open, “system of systems” integration with traditional ICT systems, susceptible to traditional computer attacks. In this paper we present a novel approach to detect cyber attacks targeting measurements sent to control hardware, i.e., typically to Programmable Logical Controllers (PLC). The approach builds on the Gaussian mixture model to cluster sensor measurement values and a cluster assessment technique known as silhouette. We experimentally demonstrate that in this particular problem the Gaussian mixture clustering outperforms the k-means clustering algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is tested in a scenario involving the simulated Tennessee-Eastman chemical process and three different cyber attacks.},

abstract={Safe and reliable intelligent charging stations are imperative in an intelligent transportation infrastructure. Over the past few years, a big number of smart charging stations have been deployed, and most of them are online and connected, resulting in potential risks of threats. Although there exists related work on securing intelligent vehicles, very little work focused on the security of charging devices. Unlike traditional network systems, these power-related Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) use many different proprietary protocols and diverse interactions. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on network traffic are thus not suitable for these systems. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection method in real vehicle power supply systems based on a deep architecture model. In particular, we propose a novel traffic anomaly detection model based on Multi-Head Attentions (MHA) that take into account the inherent correlations of traffic generated by ICSs. The MHA model is employed to substitute the traditional feature extraction and rule making process with an acceptable computational cost for classifying traffic data. It is an attention-based model that employs Google Transformer encoder architecture to extract recessive features of traffic for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by experiments on two real-world power ICS testbeds including a substation with a slave charging station and a power generation simulation platform based on a distributed control system. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the MHA model outperforms the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based and classical machine learning detection models with an accuracy rate of 99.86%.},

abstract={The spoofing attack is critical to bypass physical-layer signal authentication. This paper presents a deep learning-based spoofing attack to generate synthetic wireless signals that cannot be statistically distinguished from intended transmissions. The adversary is modeled as a pair of a transmitter and a receiver that build the generator and discriminator of the generative adversarial network, respectively, by playing a minimax game over the air. The adversary transmitter trains a deep neural network to generate the best spoofing signals and fool the best defense trained as another deep neural network at the adversary receiver. Each node (defender or adversary) may have multiple transmitter or receiver antennas. Signals are spoofed by jointly capturing waveform, channel, and radio hardware effects that are inherent to wireless signals under attack. Compared with spoofing attacks using random or replayed signals, the proposed attack increases the probability of misclassifying spoofing signals as intended signals for different network topology and mobility patterns. The adversary transmitter can increase the spoofing attack success by using multiple antennas, while the attack success decreases when the defender receiver uses multiple antennas. For practical deployment, the attack implementation on embedded platforms demonstrates the low latency of generating or classifying spoofing signals.},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems define an important and dynamic research area for cybersecurity. The role of Intrusion Detection System within security architecture is to improve a security level by identification of all malicious and also suspicious events that could be observed in computer or network system. One of the more specific research areas related to intrusion detection is anomaly detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection in networks refers to the problem of finding untypical events in the observed network traffic that do not conform to the expected normal patterns. It is assumed that everything that is untypical/anomalous could be dangerous and related to some security events. To detect anomalies many security systems implements a classification or clustering algorithms. However, recent research proved that machine learning models might misclassify adversarial events, e.g. observations which were created by applying intentionally non-random perturbations to the dataset. Such weakness could increase of false negative rate which implies undetected attacks. This fact can lead to one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities of intrusion detection systems. The goal of the research performed was verification of the anomaly detection systems ability to resist this type of attack. This paper presents the preliminary results of tests taken to investigate existence of attack vector, which can use adversarial examples to conceal a real attack from being detected by intrusion detection systems.},

abstract={Edge computing is a key-enabling technology that meets continuously increasing requirements for the intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To cope with the increasing privacy leakages of machine learning while benefiting from unbalanced data distributions, federated learning has been wildly adopted as a novel intelligent edge computing framework with a localized training mechanism. However, recent studies found that the federated learning framework exhibits inherent vulnerabilities on active attacks, and poisoning attack is one of the most powerful and secluded attacks where the functionalities of the global model could be damaged through attacker's well-crafted local updates. In this article, we give a comprehensive exploration of the poisoning attack mechanisms in the context of federated learning. We first present a poison data generation method, named Data_Gen, based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method mainly relies upon the iteratively updated global model parameters to regenerate samples of interested victims. Second, we further propose a novel generative poisoning attack model, named PoisonGAN, against the federated learning framework. This model utilizes the designed Data_Gen method to efficiently reduce the attack assumptions and make attacks feasible in practice. We finally evaluate our data generation and attack models by implementing two types of typical poisoning attack strategies, label flipping and backdoor, on a federated learning prototype. The experimental results demonstrate that these two attack models are effective in federated learning.},

This is a problem in the view of the safety and security of artificial intelligence, which has recently been studied a lot. These attacks have shown that they can easily fool models of image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. We focus on the adversarial attack in semantic segmentation tasks since there is little work in this task. We point out this attack can be protected by denoise autoencoder, which is used for denoising the perturbation and restoring the original images. We build a deep denoise autoencoder model for removing the adversarial perturbation and restoring the clean image. We experiment with various noise distributions and verify the effect of denoise autoencoder against adversarial attack in semantic segmentation task.},

abstract={The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms provides the industrial domain with many critical solutions, such as joint venture virtual production systems. However, the extensive interconnection of industrial systems with corporate systems in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks exposes the industrial domain to severe cyber risks. Because of many proprietary multilevel protocols, limited upgrade opportunities, heterogeneous communication infrastructures, and a very large trust boundary, conventional IT security fails to prevent cyberattacks against IIoT networks. Recent secure protocols, such as secure distributed network protocol (DNP 3.0), are limited to weak hash functions for critical response time requirements. As a complementary, we propose an adaptive trust boundary protection for IIoT networks using a deep-learning, feature-extraction-based semisupervised model. Our proposed approach is novel in that it is compatible with multilevel protocols of IIoT. The proposed approach does not require any manual effort to update the attack databases and can learn the rapidly changing natures of unknown attack models using unsupervised learnings and unlabeled data from the wild. Therefore, the proposed approach is resilient to emerging cyberattacks and their dynamic nature. The proposed approach has been verified using a real IIoT testbed. Extensive experimental analysis of the attack models and results shows that the proposed approach significantly improves the identification of attacks over conventional security control techniques.},

abstract={Saliency detection is an effective front-end process to many security-related tasks, e.g. automatic drive and tracking. Adversarial attack serves as an efficient surrogate to evaluate the robustness of deep saliency models before they are deployed in real world. However, most of current adversarial attacks exploit the gradients spanning the entire image space to craft adversarial examples, ignoring the fact that natural images are high-dimensional and spatially over-redundant, thus causing expensive attack cost and poor perceptibility. To circumvent these issues, this paper builds an efficient bridge between the accessible partially-white-box source models and the unknown black-box target models. The proposed method includes two steps: 1) We design a new partially-white-box attack, which defines the cost function in the compact hidden space to punish a fraction of feature activations corresponding to the salient regions, instead of punishing every pixel spanning the entire dense output space. This partially-white-box attack reduces the redundancy of the adversarial perturbation. 2) We exploit the non-redundant perturbations from some source models as the prior cues, and use an iterative zeroth-order optimizer to compute the directional derivatives along the non-redundant prior directions, in order to estimate the actual gradient of the black-box target model. The non-redundant priors boost the update of some “critical” pixels locating at non-zero coordinates of the prior cues, while keeping other redundant pixels locating at the zero coordinates unaffected. Our method achieves the best tradeoff between attack ability and perturbation redundancy.

abstract={A cyber-attack detection system issues alerts when an attacker attempts to coerce a trusted software application to perform unsafe actions on the attacker's behalf. One way of issuing such alerts is to create an application-agnostic cyber- attack detection system that responds to prevalent software vulnerabilities. The creation of such an autonomic alert system, however, is impeded by the disparity between implementation language, function, quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, and architectural patterns present in applications, all of which contribute to the rapidly changing threat landscape presented by modern heterogeneous software systems. This paper evaluates the feasibility of creating an autonomic cyber-attack detection system and applying it to several exemplar web-based applications using program transformation and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we examine whether it is possible to detect cyber-attacks (1) online, i.e., as they occur using lightweight structures derived from a call graph and (2) offline, i.e., using machine learning techniques trained with features extracted from a trace of application execution. In both cases, we first characterize normal application behavior using supervised training with the test suites created for an application as part of the software development process. We then intentionally perturb our test applications so they are vulnerable to common attack vectors and then evaluate the effectiveness of various feature extraction and learning strategies on the perturbed applications. Our results show that both lightweight on-line models based on control flow of execution path and application specific off-line models can successfully and efficiently detect in-process cyber-attacks against web applications.},

abstract={A variety of Machine Learning (ML) applications involve data of privacy-sensitive content. Face recognizer is one of them which due to training by user identities face images, it is inherent to user face image as a critical biometric data. A face recognition system can be subject to privacy attacks even though it deploys a complex model structure like a deeplearning-based one. Because as the ML models advance to carry more complexity in structure and parameters, the privacy attack trends develop too. Model Inversion Attack (MIA) pioneered by Fredrikson et al [1] was applied on a shallow neural network of face recognizer, and its capability of privacy leakage was approved. Their work was on a white-box scenario wherein besides the model structure, the privacy-non-sensitive data of the users are partially available and used by the attacker for generation and leakage of the user identity face images. The present work improves the extension of MIA to deep learning models of face recognizers while performing without any data of the users. Despite the complexity of the deep models as an obstacle, this work improves the capability of MIA in this matter. To aim this goal, it initializes its training procedure by a seed image approved by a GAN-trained discriminator of face image data-space via its output probability value. In targeting two users' identities by MIA, the proposed technique approves its efficiency on a deep face recognition system. The recognition rates of the images generated by MIA associated with GAN data-space discriminator (GAN-DD) are higher than sole MIA and demonstrate efficiency improvement of deep MIA.},

DER, however, are unique in that they are typically neither owned nor operated by distribution utilities and, therefore, represent a new emerging attack vector for cyber-physical attacks.

abstract={State estimation is of considerable significance for the power system operation and control. However, well-designed false data injection attacks can utilize blind spots in conventional residual-based bad data detection methods to manipulate measurements in a coordinated manner and thus affect the secure operation and economic dispatch of grids. In this paper, we propose a detection approach based on an autoencoder neural network. By training the network on the dependencies intrinsic in `normal' operation data, it effectively overcomes the challenge of unbalanced training data that is inherent in power system attack detection. To evaluate the detection performance of the proposed mechanism, we conduct a series of experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power system. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder detector displays robust detection performance under a variety of attack scenarios.},

abstract={Increasing deep neural networks are applied in solving graph evolved tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. However, the vulnerability of deep models can be revealed using carefully crafted adversarial examples generated by various adversarial attack methods. To explore this security problem, we define the link prediction adversarial attack problem and put forward a novel iterative gradient attack (IGA) strategy using the gradient information in the trained graph autoencoder (GAE) model. Not surprisingly, GAE can be fooled by an adversarial graph with a few links perturbed on the clean one. The results on comprehensive experiments of different real-world graphs indicate that most deep models and even the state-of-the-art link prediction algorithms cannot escape the adversarial attack, such as GAE. We can benefit the attack as an efficient privacy protection tool from the link prediction of unknown violations. On the other hand, the adversarial attack is a robust evaluation metric for current link prediction algorithms of their defensibility.},

abstract={The increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems motivates new modeling approaches to ensure system security right from the design process. In this paper, we present a model-based approach to formally validate communicating systems against cyber-attacks. Security requirements are modeled by using the unified modeling language (UML) extended attack tree profile with temporal logic operators. Moreover, to identify attack propagation, another UML profile, i.e., the connectivity profile, has been integrated to model interactions between system components. In order to carry out a formal verification of the system, a transformation platform that automatically generates a new symbolic model verifier code from systems modeling language (SysML) models for both static and dynamic aspects has been developed. The modeling and validation process is illustrated via two case studies on connected cars: 2014 Jeep Cherokee attack and 2016 Tesla Model S attack.},

abstract={The aviation industries are transitioning from conventional aircraft systems to Aviation Cyber-Physical Systems (ACPS) based aircraft. However, like any Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the ACPS are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can be mounted by adversaries through the communication network infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel and resilient security protocol for detecting and defending ACPS against sensor spoofing cyber-attacks. First, a communication environment was developed to establish an aircraft Networked Control System (NCS) using the SimEvents toolbox. Then, a cyber-attack detection algorithm based on the positive selection of the Artificial Immune System (AIS) approach was developed and used to detect and drop suspicious communication packets on the aircraft network traffic. Finally, the NCS and the detection algorithm were integrated and tested on real cyber-security attack scenarios. The algorithm's accuracy was 0.96 based on the True Positive and True Negative algorithm detection rate. For further defending the aircraft against cyber-attacks, Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) algorithm was developed to reconstruct or estimate the network dropped packets. The estimation accuracy of the NARX reached 0.99 using the coefficient of determination (R-value) based on the linear regression approach. The real-time simulation test results showed that the sensor spoofing cyber-attack was successfully detected. Also, the communication network of the ACPS was defended against the attack because the ACPS was maintaining the normal performance during the course of the cyber-attack.},

abstract={Backdoor data poisoning attacks have recently been demonstrated in computer vision research as a potential safety risk for machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional data poisoning attacks manipulate training data to induce unreliability of an ML model, whereas backdoor data poisoning attacks maintain system performance unless the ML model is presented with an input containing an embedded "trigger " that provides a predetermined response advantageous to the adversary. Our work builds upon prior backdoor data-poisoning research for ML image classifiers and systematically assesses different experimental conditions including types of trigger patterns, persistence of trigger patterns during retraining, poisoning strategies, architectures (ResNet-50, NasNet, NasNet-Mobile), datasets (Flowers, CIFAR-10), and potential defensive regularization techniques (Contrastive Loss, Logit Squeezing, Manifold Mixup, Soft-Nearest-Neighbors Loss). Experiments yield four key findings. First, the success rate of backdoor poisoning attacks varies widely, depending on several factors, including model architecture, trigger pattern and regularization technique. Second, we find that poisoned models are hard to detect through performance inspection alone. Third, regularization typically reduces backdoor success rate, although it can have no effect or even slightly increase it, depending on the form of regularization. Finally, backdoors inserted through data poisoning can be rendered ineffective after just a few epochs of additional training on a small set of clean data without affecting the model's performance.},

abstract={Deep neural networks are susceptible to poisoning attacks by purposely polluted training data with specific triggers. As existing episodes mainly focused on attack success rate with patch-based samples, defense algorithms can easily detect these poisoning samples. We propose DeepPoison, a novel adversarial network of one generator and two discriminators, to address this problem. Specifically, the generator automatically extracts the target class’ hidden features and embeds them into benign training samples. One discriminator controls the ratio of the poisoning perturbation. The other discriminator works as the target model to testify the poisoning effects. The novelty of DeepPoison lies in that the generated poisoned training samples are indistinguishable from the benign ones by both defensive methods and manual visual inspection, and even benign test samples can achieve the attack. Extensive experiments have shown that DeepPoison can achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate, as high as 91.74%, with only 7% poisoned samples on publicly available datasets LFW and CASIA. Furthermore, we have experimented with high-performance defense algorithms such as autodecoder defense and DBSCAN cluster detection and showed the resilience of DeepPoison.},

abstract={The boundaries of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are converging together day by day to introduce a common platform on hybrid systems. Moreover, the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) with CPS creates a new dimension of technological advancement. All these connectivity and dependability are creating massive space for the attackers to launch cyber attacks. To defend against these attacks, intrusion detection system (IDS) has been widely used. However, emerging CPS fields suffer from imbalanced and missing sample data, which makes the training of IDS difficult. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based intrusion detection system (G-IDS), where GAN generates synthetic samples, and IDS gets trained on them along with the original ones. G-IDS also fixes the difficulties of imbalanced or missing data problems. We model a network security dataset for an emerging CPS using NSL KDD-99 dataset and evaluate our proposed model's performance using different metrics. We find that our proposed G-IDS model performs much better in attack detection and model stabilization during the training process than a standalone IDS.},

Previous research has mainly focused on improving DNN models, but either results are limited or expensive calculations are required. This paper studies an integrated feature noise reduction method: by using Gaussian filtering, mean filtering, and median filtering, the automatic encoder integrates a neural network to prevent the generation of adaptive adversarial samples. By comparing the reconstruction error of the autoencoder to detect adversarial samples, these simple strategies are not only low-cost, but also complementary to other defensive measures. In this paper, a new autoencoder is created as a modifier to make the two combine to form an adversarial The joint detection framework of the sample to achieve a high detection rate for the latest attacks. For several methods with high attack success rates, FGSM, BIM, PGD and CW attacks. For larger disturbances, the black box attacks against the MNIST data set the undetected rate of CW non-target attacks is 23%, and the detection rate of other attacks is 100%. The undetected rate of CIFAR-10 black box attacks except CW non-target attacks is 25%, and the undetected rate of other attacks is below 5%. In the case of black box attacks with small disturbances, the classification accuracy of the MNIST protected network has reached more than 90%, and the classification accuracy of the CIFAR-10 protected network has reached more than 80% in addition to the CW attack classification.

The time gap between public announcement of vulnerability and its detection, and reporting to interested stakeholders is the key to successful prevention of vulnerability exploitation by adversaries.

abstract={Machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attack. By applying to the input object a small, carefully-designed perturbation, a classifier can be tricked into making an incorrect prediction. This phenomenon has drawn wide interest, with many attempts made to explain it. However, a complete understanding is yet to emerge. In this paper we adopt a slightly different perspective, still relevant to classification. We consider retrieval, where the output is a set of objects most similar to a user-supplied query object, corresponding to the set of k-nearest neighbors. We investigate the effect of adversarial perturbation on the ranking of objects with respect to a query. Through theoretical analysis, supported by experiments, we demonstrate that as the intrinsic dimensionality of the data domain rises, the amount of perturbation required to subvert neighborhood rankings diminishes, and the vulnerability to adversarial attack rises. We examine two modes of perturbation of the query: either `closer' to the target point, or `farther' from it. We also consider two perspectives: `query-centric', examining the effect of perturbation on the query's own neighborhood ranking, and `target-centric', considering the ranking of the query point in the target's neighborhood set. All four cases correspond to practical scenarios involving classification and retrieval.},

abstract={Publicly available software vulnerabilities and exploit code are often abused by malicious actors to launch cyberattacks to vulnerable targets. Organizations not only have to update their software to the latest versions, but do effective patch management and prioritize security-related patching as well. In addition to intelligence sources such as Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) alerts, cybersecurity news, national vulnerability database (NBD), and commercial cybersecurity vendors, social media is another valuable source that facilitates early stage intelligence gathering. To early detect future cyber threats based on publicly available resources on the Internet, we propose a dynamic vulnerability-threat assessment model to predict the tendency to be exploited for vulnerability entries listed in Common Vulnerability Exposures, and also to analyze social media contents such as Twitter to extract meaningful information. The model takes multiple aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from different sources into consideration. Features range from profile information to contextual information about these vulnerabilities. For the social media data, this study leverages machine learning techniques specially for Twitter which helps to filter out non-cybersecurity-related tweets and also label the topic categories of each tweet. When applied to predict the vulnerabilities exploitation and analyzed the real-world social media discussion data, it showed promising prediction accuracy with purified social media intelligence. Moreover, the AI-enabling modules have been deployed into a threat intelligence platform for further applications.},

abstract={Complex Big Data systems in modern organisations are progressively becoming attack targets by existing and emerging threat agents. Elaborate and specialised attacks will increasingly be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses. With the ever-increasing trend of cybercrime and incidents due to these vulnerabilities, effective vulnerability management is imperative for modern organisations regardless of their size. However, organisations struggle to manage the sheer volume of vulnerabilities discovered on their networks. Moreover, vulnerability management tends to be more reactive in practice. Rigorous statistical models, simulating anticipated volume and dependence of vulnerability disclosures, will undoubtedly provide important insights to organisations and help them become more proactive in the management of cyber risks. By leveraging the rich yet complex historical vulnerability data, our proposed novel and rigorous framework has enabled this new capability. By utilising this sound framework, we initiated an important study on not only handling persistent volatilities in the data but also further unveiling multivariate dependence structure amongst different vulnerability risks. In sharp contrast to the existing studies on univariate time series, we consider the more general multivariate case striving to capture their intriguing relationships. Through our extensive empirical studies using the real world vulnerability data, we have shown that a composite model can effectively capture and preserve long-term dependency between different vulnerability and exploit disclosures. In addition, the paper paves the way for further study on the stochastic perspective of vulnerability proliferation towards building more accurate measures for better cyber risk management as a whole.},

abstract={Although neural network-based speech recognition models have enjoyed significant success in many acoustic systems, they are susceptible to be attacked by the adversarial examples. In this work, we make first step towards using generative adversarial network (GAN) for constructing the targeted speech adversarial examples. Specifically, we integrate the target speech recognition network with GAN framework, which can then be formulated as a three-party game. The generator in GAN aims at generating perturbation that could make the target network misclassified to a specific target, while simultaneously fooling the discriminator treating the adversarial example as a beguine one. The discriminator is to distinguish the crafted examples from the geniue samples. The classification error of the target network is back-propagated via gradient flow to the generator for updating. The target network is responsible for back-propagating the classification error via gradients to the generator for updating, but the target network itself is freezed. With the carefully designed network architecture, loss function and training strategy, we successfully train a generator that could generate the adversarial perturbation for a given speech clip and a target label. Experiential results show that the generated adversarial examples could effectively fool the state-of-the-art speech classification networks, while attaining an acceptable auditory perception quality. In addition, our proposed method runs much faster than the prevalent optimization-based schemes.

abstract={Face recognition in unconstraint surveillance is a complicated problem on account of motion blur, expression variations and low resolution. Recent works have demonstrated that patch-attention is strictly more powerful than convolution in recognition models. In this study, we investigate the task of unconstraint surveillance face recognition. First, a Patch-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (PA-GAN) model is devised to aggregate some robust features on behalf of a set of raw surveillance frames, which not only increases the recognition accuracy but also reduces the computational costs of face matching. Second, an improved center loss function combined with abundant unlabeled surveillance faces is utilized to accurately classify the known identities. With the proposed method, the discriminativeness of the face representations is largely enhanced. Finally, the proposed method is verified in two widely used datasets, IJB-A dataset and QMUL-SurvFace dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness. Evaluation of the algorithm performances in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods indicates that the proposed design can achieve competitive accuracy on both the verification and identification protocols.},

abstract={Digital audio recording is the main evidence used in the field of judicial forensics. Recently, a number of digital audio forensic techniques have been developed and the audio source identification (ASI) is one of the most active research topics. Most of existing ASI works mainly focus on improving the performance of detection accuracy and robustness. Little consideration has been given to ASI anti-forensics, which aims at attacking the forensic techniques. To expose the weaknesses of these source identification methods, we propose an anti-forensic framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to falsify the source information of an audio by adding specific disturbance. The experimental results show that the falsified audio can deceive the forensic methods effectively, and can even control their conclusions. Three state-of-art ASI methods have been evaluated as the attacking targets. For the confusing attack, the proposed method can significantly reduce their detection accuracies from about 97% to less than 5%. For the misleading attack, a misleading rate about 81.32% has been achieved while ensuring the perceptual quality of the anti-forensic audio.},

abstract={As web applications become more prevalent, web security becomes more and more important. Cross-site scripting vulnerability abbreviated as XSS is a kind of common injection web vulnerability. The exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities can hijack users' sessions, modify, read and delete business data of web applications, place malicious codes in web applications, and control victims to attack other targeted servers. This paper discusses classification of XSS, and designs a demo website to demonstrate attack processes of common XSS exploitation scenarios. The paper also compares and analyzes recent research results on XSS detection, divides them into three categories according to different mechanisms. The three categories are static analysis methods, dynamic analysis methods and hybrid analysis methods. The paper classifies 30 detection methods into above three categories, makes overall comparative analysis among them, lists their strengths and weaknesses and detected XSS vulnerability types. In the end, the paper explores some ways to prevent XSS vulnerabilities from being exploited.},

pages={184-197},
abstract={In this work, we investigate the concept of biometric backdoors: a template poisoning attack on biometric systems that allows adversaries to stealthily and effortlessly impersonate users in the long-term by exploiting the template update procedure. We show that such attacks can be carried out even by attackers with physical limitations (no digital access to the sensor) and zero knowledge of training data (they know neither decision boundaries nor user template). Based on the adversaries' own templates, they craft several intermediate samples that incrementally bridge the distance between their own template and the legitimate user's. As these adversarial samples are added to the template, the attacker is eventually accepted alongside the legitimate user. To avoid detection, we design the attack to minimize the number of rejected samples. We design our method to cope with weak assumptions for the attacker and we evaluate the effectiveness of this approach on state-of-the-art face recognition pipelines based on deep neural networks. We find that in white-box scenarios, adversaries can successfully carry out the attack in over 70 % of cases with less than ten injection attempts. Even in black-box scenarios, we find that exploiting the transferability of adversarial samples from surrogate models can lead to successful attacks in around 15 % of cases. Finally, we design a poisoning detection technique that leverages the consistent directionality of template updates in feature space to discriminate between legitimate and malicious updates. We evaluate such a countermeasure with a set of intra-user variability factors which may present the same directionality characteristics, obtaining equal error rates for the detection between 7-14% and leading to over 99% of attacks being detected after only two sample injections.

abstract={Face morphing attacks aim at creating face images that are verifiable to be the face of multiple identities, which can lead to building faulty identity links in operations like border crossing. Research has been focused on creating more accurate attack detection approaches by considering different image properties. However, all the attacks considered so far are based on manipulating facial landmarks localized in the morphed face images. In contrast, this work presents novel face morphing attacks based on image generated by generative adversarial networks. We present the MorGAN structure that considers the representation loss to successfully create realistic morphing attacks. Based on that, we present a novel face morphing attacks database (MorGAN database) that contains 1000 morph images for both, the proposed MorGAN and landmark-based attacks. We present vulnerability analysis of two face recognition approaches facing the proposed attacks. Moreover, the detectability of the proposed MorGAN attacks is studied, in the scenarios where this type of attacks is know and un- known. We concluded with pointing out the challenge of detecting such unknown novel attacks and an analysis of detection performances of different features in detecting such attacks.},

abstract={Efficient diagnosis of concrete structures is a growing issue in modern societies where concrete is an omnipresent material. The hammering test is a traditional nondestructive testing method that has been employed in the field for a long time and for which automation is highly desirable. The problem consists in determining from the sound returned after a hammer strike on a structure's surface if there is a defect beneath or not. In this letter, we present an unsupervised learning approach for the automation of hammering test. First, mean shift is used with Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients at various parameter values in order to find a stable mode configuration. Then, the corresponding peaks are used to obtain seeds for spatial fuzzy c-means to cluster hammering samples while combining audio and position information. Experiments have been conducted in indoor artificial environment on concrete blocks containing man-made defects. Results showed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solution on detecting different types and number of defects. Our approach showed promising performance also in tests performed in outdoor environment using a fully automated hammering system.},

abstract={Service computing is playing a more and more important role in current Internet activities, especially with the rapid adoption of electric markets, more and more individuals are engaging with commercial services. As the potential profit of service computing is becoming clear, malicious users are ramping up unfair rating attacks that can mislead honest service consumers into transacting with dishonest service providers. Moreover, some dishonest service providers may collude with dishonest service consumers to damage the reputation of service rivals. In this paper, we proposed a clustering-based reputation system that is robust to various unfair rating attacks. The model categorizes consumers as either honest or dishonest according to their rating ratio. It utilizes the Dirichlet distribution in determining reputation values. We analyze the profits and costs attained by the attacker and elucidate the conditions under which an attack is profitable. Experiments demonstrate that our clustering-based reputation model is more robust than the state-of-art model against currently successful attacks.},

pages={146308-146322},
abstract={Until now, the human expert segments retinal blood vessels manually in fundus images to inspect human retinal-related diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular occlusion. Recently, many studies were conducted for automatic retinal vessel segmentation from fundus images through supervised and unsupervised methods to minimize user intervention. However, most of them lack in segmentation robustness and cannot optimize loss functions so that results of the segmentation have made lots of fake or thin branches. This article proposes a new conditional generative adversarial network called M-GAN to conduct accurate and precise retinal vessel segmentation by balancing losses through stacked deep fully convolutional networks. It consists of a newly designed M-generator with deep residual blocks for more robust segmentation and an M-discriminator with a deeper network for more efficient training of the adversarial model. In particular, a multi-kernel pooling block is added between the stacked layers to support the scale-invariance of vessel segmentations of different sizes. The M-generator has down-sampling layers to extract features and up-sampling layers to make segmented retinal blood vessel images from the extracted features. The M-discriminator also has a deeper network similar to the down-sampling of the M-generator, but the final layer is constructed as a fully connected layer for decision making. We conduct pre-processing of the input image using automatic color equalization (ACE) to make the retinal vessels of the input fundus image more clear and perform post-processing that makes the vessel branches smooth and reduces false-negatives using a Lanczos resampling method. To verify the proposed method, we used DRIVE, STARE, HRF, and CHASE-DB1datasets and compared the proposed M-GAN with other studies. We measured accuracy, the intersection of union (IoU), F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for comparative analysis. Results of comparison proved that the proposed M-GAN derived superior performance than other studies.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide good performance for image recognition, speech recognition, and pattern recognition. However, a poisoning attack is a serious threat to DNN's security. The poisoning attack is a method to reduce the accuracy of DNN by adding malicious training data during DNN training process. In some situations such as a military, it may be necessary to drop only a chosen class of accuracy in the model. For example, if an attacker does not allow only nuclear facilities to be selectively recognized, it may be necessary to intentionally prevent UAV from correctly recognizing nuclear-related facilities. In this paper, we propose a selective poisoning attack that reduces the accuracy of only chosen class in the model. The proposed method reduces the accuracy of a chosen class in the model by training malicious training data corresponding to a chosen class, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes. For experiment, we used tensorflow as a machine learning library and MNIST and CIFAR10 as datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the accuracy of the chosen class to 43.2% and 55.3% in MNIST and CIFAR10, while maintaining the accuracy of the remaining classes.},

abstract={In a modern vehicle, there are over seventy Electronics Control Units (ECUs). For an in-vehicle network, ECUs communicate with each other by following a standard communication protocol, such as Controller Area Network (CAN). However, an attacker can easily access the in-vehicle network to compromise ECUs through a WLAN or Bluetooth. Though there are various deep learning (DL) methods suggested for securing in-vehicle networks, recent studies on adversarial examples have shown that attackers can easily fool DL models. In this research, we further explore adversarial examples in an in-vehicle network. We first discover and implement two adversarial attack models that are harmful to a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection model used in the in-vehicle network. As shown in our experiments, adversaries can attack the LSTM-based detection model with a success rate of over 98%. Then, we propose an Adversarial Attack Defending System (AADS) for securing an in-vehicle network. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs in an in-vehicle network. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AADS achieves over 99 % accuracy for detecting adversarial attacks.},

abstract={With the widespread use of deep learning system in many applications, the adversary has strong incentive to explore vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and manipulate them. Backdoor attacks against deep neural networks have been reported to be a new type of threat. In this attack, the adversary will inject backdoors into the model and then cause the misbehavior of the model through inputs including backdoor triggers. Existed research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks in image classification based on CNN, little attention has been paid to the backdoor attacks in RNN. In this paper, we implement a backdoor attack against LSTM-based text classification by data poisoning. After the backdoor is injected, the model will misclassify any text samples that contains a specific trigger sentence into the target category determined by the adversary. The backdoor attack is stealthy and the backdoor injected in the model has little impact on the performance of the model. We consider the backdoor attack in black-box setting, where the adversary has no knowledge of model structures or training algorithms except for a small amount of training data. We verify the attack through sentiment analysis experiment on the dataset of IMDB movie reviews. The experimental results indicate that our attack can achieve around 96% success rate with 1% poisoning rate.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel feature selection method, namely, unified simultaneous clustering feature selection (USCFS). A regularized regression with a new type of target matrix is formulated to select the most discriminative features among the original features from labeled or unlabeled data. The regression with l2,1-norm regularization allows the projection matrix to represent an effective selection of discriminative features. For unsupervised feature selection, the target matrix discovers label-like information not from the original data points but rather from projected data points, which are of a reduced dimensionality. Without the aid of an affinity graph-based local structure learning method, USCFS allows the target matrix to capture latent cluster centers via orthogonal basis clustering and to simultaneously select discriminative features guided by latent cluster centers. When class labels are available, the target matrix is also able to find latent class labels by regarding the groundtruth class labels as an approximate guide. Hence, supervised feature selection is realized using these latent class labels, which may differ from the ground-truth class labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on diverse real-world data sets for both the supervised and the unsupervised feature selection.},

abstract={Federated learning is a novel distributed learning framework, where the deep learning model is trained in a collaborative manner among thousands of participants. The shares between server and participants are only model parameters, which prevent the server from direct access to the private training data. However, we notice that the federated learning architecture is vulnerable to an active attack from insider participants, called poisoning attack, where the attacker can act as a benign participant in federated learning to upload the poisoned update to the server so that he can easily affect the performance of the global model. In this work, we study and evaluate a poisoning attack in federated learning system based on generative adversarial nets (GAN). That is, an attacker first acts as a benign participant and stealthily trains a GAN to mimic prototypical samples of the other participants' training set which does not belong to the attacker. Then these generated samples will be fully controlled by the attacker to generate the poisoning updates, and the global model will be compromised by the attacker with uploading the scaled poisoning updates to the server. In our evaluation, we show that the attacker in our construction can successfully generate samples of other benign participants using GAN and the global model performs more than 80% accuracy on both poisoning tasks and main tasks.},

abstract={Control systems for critical infrastructure are becoming increasingly interconnected while cyber threats against critical infrastructure are becoming more sophisticated and difficult to defend against. Historically, cyber security has emphasized building defenses to prevent loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in digital information and systems, but in recent years cyber attacks have demonstrated that no system is impenetrable and that control system operation may be detrimentally impacted. Cyber resilience has emerged as a complementary priority that seeks to ensure that digital systems can maintain essential performance levels, even while capabilities are degraded by a cyber attack. This paper examines how cyber security and cyber resilience may be measured and quantified in a control system environment. Load Frequency Control is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate how cyber attacks may be represented within mathematical models of control systems, to demonstrate how these events may be quantitatively measured in terms of cyber security or cyber resilience, and the differences and similarities between the two mindsets. These results demonstrate how various metrics are applied, the extent of their usability, and how it is important to analyze cyber-physical systems in a comprehensive manner that accounts for all the various parts of the system.},

First extension (ClRe 3.1): targets improving accuracy of indexed clusters representatives by taking the average of individual warped items and keeping only 50% of the warped items for each warped slot. Second extension (ClRe 3.2): targets decreasing size of indexed clusters representatives as possible by compensating every warped slot by its corresponding item keeping only common items with minimum distances. The proposed extensions are explained using real samples and evaluated using Szeged-weather dataset as well. The evaluation results proves that ClRe 3.1 could enhance the accuracy of ClRe 3.0 by approximate 9% in average, keeping indexes sizes as possible as fitted (i.e., <; the average length of all datasets). In case of indexing only highly common readings, ClRe 3.2 out-performs other extensions in decreasing indexes sizes.},

abstract={Network control in microgrids is an active research area driven by a steady increase in energy demand, the necessity to minimize the environmental footprint, yet achieve socioeconomic benefits and ensure sustainability. Reducing deviation of the predicted energy consumption from the actual one, softening peaks in demand and filling in the troughs, especially at times when power is more affordable and clean, present challenges for the demand-side response. In this paper, we present a hierarchical energy system architecture with embedded control. This architecture pushes prediction models to edge devices and executes local control loops to address the challenge of managing demand-side response locally. We employ a two-step approach: At an upper level of hierarchy, we adopt a conventional machine learning pipeline to build load prediction models using automated domain-specific feature extraction and selection. Given historical data, these models are then used to label prediction failure events that force the operator to use backup energy sources to stabilize the network. On a lower level of hierarchy, computed labels are used to train impact models realized by LSTM networks running on edge devices to infer the probability that the power consumption of the player contributes to the upper level prediction failure event. The system is evaluated on clustered and aggregated energy traces from a public data set of academic buildings. The results show the benefits of the proposed hierarchical energy system architecture in terms of impact prediction with 55% accuracy. This allows minimizing the number of prediction failure events by 11.69 % by executing targeted local control.},

abstract={In complex production systems, the diagnosis and correction of faults requires operators to possess a deep understanding of the specific processes and machines as well as general knowledge about the interactions between different system components. However, in actual work environments operator qualification and experience is quite diverse, which leads to an immense variability in the time required for fault diagnosis and in the quality of corrective actions. Both time and quality of fault diagnosis and correction are vital parameters in the functioning of a plant, because downtimes have severe economic consequences and thus should be kept to a minimum. With the introduction of highly complex and flexible cyber-physical production systems, these problems are aggravated as fault sources vary and diagnosis becomes even more challenging. The paper presents a concept for a self-learning assistance system that supports operators in finding and evaluating solution strategies for complex faults. This concept applies a question-answer approach which allows for an incremental, dialogue-based establishment of common ground between operators and the assistance system.},

abstract={Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to various applications. However, they are potentially vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where sophisticated attackers can disrupt the learning procedure by injecting a fraction of malicious samples into the training dataset. Existing defense techniques against poisoning attacks are largely attack-specific: they are designed for one specific type of attacks but do not work for other types, mainly due to the distinct principles they follow. Yet few general defense strategies have been developed. In this paper, we propose De-Pois, an attack-agnostic defense against poisoning attacks. The key idea of De-Pois is to train a mimic model the purpose of which is to imitate the behavior of the target model trained by clean samples. We take advantage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to facilitate informative training data augmentation as well as the mimic model construction. By comparing the prediction differences between the mimic model and the target model, De-Pois is thus able to distinguish the poisoned samples from clean ones, without explicit knowledge of any ML algorithms or types of poisoning attacks. We implement four types of poisoning attacks and evaluate De-Pois with five typical defense methods on different realistic datasets. The results demonstrate that De-Pois is effective and efficient for detecting poisoned data against all the four types of poisoning attacks, with both the accuracy and F1-score over 0.9 on average.},

abstract={The cloud computing paradigm is changing how businesses operate, providing greater efficiency, tolerance, elasticity and flexibility in computing workloads. Underpinning these changes are multiple data centers, operated by different entities and distributed globally. Despite these benefits, cloud computing presents new classes of cyber-attack, opportunities to attack and processes to subvert. One of the primary strategies to defend against cyber-attacks is the migration process. A secure Virtual Machine (VM) migration is essential to safeguard cloud data centers against insider and outsider attacks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative anomaly detection system for discovering insider and outsider attacks from cloud systems and their migration process. The proposed system is named Mixture Localization-based Outliers (MLO) and utilizes Gaussian-mixture models for fitting network data and a local outlier factor function for discovering abnormal patterns in network traffic data. In order to validate the effectiveness of the models, the datasets of UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT are employed. The experimental results have revealed the high performance of the proposed system compared with several peer anomaly detection techniques.},

abstract={Distributed collaborative learning (DCL) paradigms enable building joint machine learning models from distrusted multi-party participants. Data confidentiality is guaranteed by retaining private training data on each participant's local infrastructure. However, this approach makes today's DCL design fundamentally vulnerable to data poisoning and backdoor attacks. It limits DCL's model accountability, which is key to backtracking problematic training data instances and their responsible contributors. In this paper, we introduce CALTRAIN, a centralized collaborative learning system that simultaneously achieves data confidentiality and model accountability. CALTRAIN enforces isolated computation via secure enclaves on centrally aggregated training data to guarantee data confidentiality. To support building accountable learning models, we securely maintain the links between training instances and their contributors. Our evaluation shows that the models generated by CALTRAIN can achieve the same prediction accuracy when compared to the models trained in non-protected environments. We also demonstrate that when malicious training participants tend to implant backdoors during model training, CALTRAIN can accurately and precisely discover the poisoned or mislabeled training data that lead to the runtime mispredictions.},

volume={12},
number={6},
pages={688-707},
abstract={Due to limited time and resources, web software engineers need support in identifying vulnerable code. A practical approach to predicting vulnerable code would enable them to prioritize security auditing efforts. In this paper, we propose using a set of hybrid (static+dynamic) code attributes that characterize input validation and input sanitization code patterns and are expected to be significant indicators of web application vulnerabilities. Because static and dynamic program analyses complement each other, both techniques are used to extract the proposed attributes in an accurate and scalable way. Current vulnerability prediction techniques rely on the availability of data labeled with vulnerability information for training. For many real world applications, past vulnerability data is often not available or at least not complete. Hence, to address both situations where labeled past data is fully available or not, we apply both supervised and semi-supervised learning when building vulnerability predictors based on hybrid code attributes. Given that semi-supervised learning is entirely unexplored in this domain, we describe how to use this learning scheme effectively for vulnerability prediction. We performed empirical case studies on seven open source projects where we built and evaluated supervised and semi-supervised models. When cross validated with fully available labeled data, the supervised models achieve an average of 77 percent recall and 5 percent probability of false alarm for predicting SQL injection, cross site scripting, remote code execution and file inclusion vulnerabilities. With a low amount of labeled data, when compared to the supervised model, the semi-supervised model showed an average improvement of 24 percent higher recall and 3 percent lower probability of false alarm, thus suggesting semi-supervised learning may be a preferable solution for many real world applications where vulnerability data is missing.},

The “rough estimation first and then precise location” hierarchical feature location method is proposed to roughly estimate the work-piece's pose first and then precisely locate it in 2D image space. The proposed method has the following main steps: (1) simple features are detected first then more complex features are examined later, using the locations of the previously found features; (2) an improved local adaptive threshold algorithm is used to binarize the work-piece's gray image; (3) a size adjustable binary template is designed to match hole features; (4) a work-piece is finally located in image space according to its CAD model using the nearest neighbor clustering algorithm. The method has been tested on a sort of complex shaped automobile engine cylinder head as an example and the location results are satisfactory.},

abstract={The Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new and promising network architecture. At the same time, SDN will surely become a new target of cyber attackers. In this paper, we point out one critical vulnerability in SDNs, the size of flow table, which is most likely to be attacked. Due to the expensive and power-hungry features of Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM), a flow table usually has a limited size, which can be easily disabled by a flow table overloading attack (a transformed DDoS attack). To provide a security service in SDN, we proposed a QoS-aware mitigation strategy, namely, peer support strategy, which integrates the available idle flow table resource of the whole SDN system to mitigate such an attack on a single switch of the system. We established a practical mathematical model to represent the studied system, and conducted a thorough analysis for the system in various circumstances. Based on our analysis, we found that the proposed strategy can effectively defeat the flow table overloading attacks. Extensive simulations and testbed-based experiments solidly support our claims. Moreover, our work also shed light on the implementation of SDN networks against possible brute-force attacks.},

abstract={Federated learning has lately received great attention for its privacy protection feature. However, recent researches found that federated learning models are susceptible to various inference attacks. In this paper, we point out a membership inference attack method that can cause a serious privacy leakage in federated learning. An adversary who is a participant in federated learning can train a classification attack model to launch the membership inference attack, which determines if a data record is in the model's training dataset. The existing membership inference method is dissatisfied due to a lack of attack data since the training data of each participant are independent. To overcome the lack of attack data, an adversary can enrich attack data using the generative adversarial network (GAN), which is a practical method to increase data diversity. We substantiate that this GAN enhanced membership inference attack method has a 98% attack accuracy. We perform experiments to show that data diversity and the overfitting make federated learning models susceptible.},

abstract={Traditional adversarial attacks rely upon the perturbations generated by gradients from the network which are generally safeguarded by gradient guided search to provide an adversarial counterpart to the network. In this letter, we propose a novel framework to generate adversarial examples where the actual image is not corrupted rather its latent space representation is utilized to tamper the inherent structure of the image while maintaining the perceptual quality intact and to act as legitimate data samples. As opposed to gradient-based attacks, the latent space poisoning exploits the inclination of classifiers to model the independent and identical distribution of the training dataset and tricks it by producing out of distribution samples. We train a disentangled variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) to model the data in latent space and then we add noise perturbations using a class-conditioned distribution function to the latent space under the constraint that it is misclassified to the target label. Our empirical results on MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA dataset validate that the generated adversarial examples can easily fool robust $l_0$, $l_2$, $l_{\infty }$ norm classifiers designed using provably robust defense mechanisms.

abstract={Being one of the most multifaceted cyber-physical systems, smart grids (SGs) are arguably more prone to cyber-threats. A covert data integrity assault (CDIA) on a communications network may be lethal to the reliability and safety of SG operations. They are intelligently designed to sidestep the traditional bad data detector in power control centers, and this type of assault can compromise the integrity of the data, causing a false estimation of the state that further severely distresses the entire power system operation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised machine learning-based scheme to detect CDIAs in SG communications networks utilizing non-labeled data. The proposed scheme employs a state-of-the-art algorithm, called isolation forest, and detects CDIAs based on the hypothesis that the assault has the shortest average path length in a constructed random forest. To tackle the dimensionality issue from the growth in power systems, we use a principal component analysis-based feature extraction technique. The evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out through standard IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is proficient at handling non-labeled historical measurement datasets and results in a significant improvement in attack detection accuracy.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed tremendous academic efforts and industry growth in machine learning. The security of machine learning has become increasingly prominent. Poisoning attack is one of the most relevant security threats to machine learning which focuses on polluting the training data that machine learning needs during the training process. Specifically, the attacker blends crafted poisoning samples into training data in order to make the learned model beneficial to him. To the best of our knowledge, existing researches about poisoning attack focused on either integrity attack or availability attack, which did not unify these two attacks together. Aside from that, from the attacker's perspective, attacker's strategy is not flexible enough. Finally, existing proposals only concentrated on increasing the test error of the learned model but ignored the importance of the concealment of attack. To overcome these issues, we firstly present a thorough adversarial model for poisoning attack in which attacker's strategy is defined from two aspects, i.e., the effect of attack and the concealment of attack. Then we unify integrity attack and availability attack together in similar formulations. Furthermore, in order to enhance flexibility, a tradeoff parameter is inserted into attacker's objective function which means the attacker can balance the attraction of effect against the requirement of concealment. Finally, as examples, extensive experiments are conducted on linear regression and logistic regression to demonstrate the effectiveness of attack.},

abstract={Due to their damage to Internet security, malware and phishing website detection has been the Internet security topics that are of great interests. Compared with malware attacks, phishing website fraud is a relatively new Internet crime. However, they share some common properties: 1) both malware samples and phishing websites are created at a rate of thousands per day driven by economic benefits; and 2) phishing websites represented by the term frequencies of the webpage content share similar characteristics with malware samples represented by the instruction frequencies of the program. Over the past few years, many clustering techniques have been employed for automatic malware and phishing website detection. In these techniques, the detection process is generally divided into two steps: 1) feature extraction, where representative features are extracted to capture the characteristics of the file samples or the websites; and 2) categorization, where intelligent techniques are used to automatically group the file samples or websites into different classes based on computational analysis of the feature representations. However, few have been applied in real industry products. In this paper, we develop an automatic categorization system to automatically group phishing websites or malware samples using a cluster ensemble by aggregating the clustering solutions that are generated by different base clustering algorithms. We propose a principled cluster ensemble framework to combine individual clustering solutions that are based on the consensus partition, which can not only be applied for malware categorization, but also for phishing website clustering. In addition, the domain knowledge in the form of sample-level/website-level constraints can be naturally incorporated into the ensemble framework. The case studies on large and real daily phishing websites and malware collection from the Kingsoft Internet Security Laboratory demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.},

abstract={The False data injection attack (FDIA) against the Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS) is a kind of data integrity attack. With more and more cyber vulnerabilities detected out, different types of FDIAs are emerging as severe threats to the stable operation of CPPS gradually.

First, a pseudo-sample database is built to assist the training and evaluation of this model, and it's more important to update the model in the future. Furthermore, the optimal feature set is extracted to characterize the behavior of the FDIA, which improves the precision of the FDIA detection model. Finally, a focal-loss-lightgbm (FLGB) ensemble classifier is constructed to detect the FDIA behavior automatically and accurately. We illustrated the performance of this model by a fusion of measurement data and power system audit logs. This model utilizes the offline training way, the conclusion shows the high precision and stability of this model, which ensures the stable operation of the smart grid and improves the FDIA resistance ability of the CPPS.},

abstract={Dynamic-state estimation plays a critical role in achieving real-time wide-area monitoring of power systems. On the other hand, false data injection (FDI) attacks are substantial threats, which can undesirably ruin the state estimation results. To tackle this problem, an effective secure hybrid dynamic-state estimation approach that involves a dynamic model of the attack vector is proposed in this article. In the proposed method, an initial estimation of the system states is first obtained using a designed unknown input observer (UIO). Subsequently, based on the system, UIO models, and the initial estimations of the states, a dynamic model for the attack vector is extracted. Ultimately, the attack model is augmented with the main system model for coestimation of the attack and the system states using a Kalman filter. The onset of the FDI attack is rapidly detected by the accurate estimation of the attack vector. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated under different FDI attack scenarios by a thorough theoretical analysis as well as simulations on IEEE 14-bus and 57-bus test systems. In order to show that the proposed method can keep up with typical scan rates of commercial phasor measurement units, a series of software-in-the-loop experiments are also conducted and the real-time feasibility of the proposed approach is guaranteed.},

abstract={Cloud storage brokerage is an abstraction aimed at providing value-added services. However, Cloud Service Brokers are challenged by several security issues including enlarged attack surfaces due to integration of disparate components and API interoperability issues. Therefore, appropriate security risk assessment methods are required to identify and evaluate these security issues, and examine the efficiency of countermeasures. A possible approach for satisfying these requirements is employment of threat modeling concepts, which have been successfully applied in traditional paradigms. In this work, we employ threat models including attack trees, attack graphs and Data Flow Diagrams against a Cloud Service Broker (CloudRAID) and analyze these security threats and risks. Furthermore, we propose an innovative technique for combining Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS) base scores in probabilistic attack graphs to cater for configuration-based vulnerabilities which are typically leveraged for attacking cloud storage systems. This approach is necessary since existing schemes do not provide sufficient security metrics, which are imperatives for comprehensive risk assessments. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposal by devising CCSS base scores for two common attacks against cloud storage: Cloud Storage Enumeration Attack and Cloud Storage Exploitation Attack. These metrics are then used in Attack Graph Metric-based risk assessment. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach caters for the aforementioned gaps and provides efficient security hardening options. Therefore, our proposals can be employed to improve cloud security.},

abstract={The advancement of Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge devices with various types of sensors enables us to harness diverse information with Mobile Crowd-Sensing applications (MCS). This highly dynamic setting entails the collection of ubiquitous data traces, originating from sensors carried by people, introducing new information security challenges; one of them being the preservation of data trustworthiness. What is needed in these settings is the timely analysis of these large datasets to produce accurate insights on the correctness of user reports. Existing data mining and other artificial intelligence methods are the most popular to gain hidden insights from IoT data, albeit with many challenges. In this paper, we first model the cyber trustworthiness of MCS reports in the presence of intelligent and colluding adversaries. We then rigorously assess, using real IoT datasets, the effectiveness and accuracy of well-known data mining algorithms when employed towards IoT security and privacy. By taking into account the spatio-temporal changes of the underlying phenomena, we demonstrate how concept drifts can masquerade the existence of attackers and their impact on the accuracy of both the clustering and classification processes. Our initial set of results clearly show that these unsupervised learning algorithms are prone to adversarial infection, thus, magnifying the need for further research in the field by leveraging a mix of advanced machine learning models and mathematical optimization techniques.},

More precisely, we propose to apply a mixture model estimation technique on the behavior of applications, for density modeling and data clustering. The mixture models of the different smartphones are then aggregated to estimate the global model that reflecting the probability density of the global data set.

abstract={Computing a prioritized set of vulnerabilities to patch is important for system administrators to determine the order of vulnerabilities to be patched that are more critical to the network security. One way to assess and analyze security to find vulnerabilities to be patched is to use attack representation models (ARMs). However, security solutions using ARMs are optimized for only the current state of the networked system. Therefore, the ARM must reanalyze the network security, causing multiple iterations of the same task to obtain the prioritized set of vulnerabilities to patch. To address this problem, we propose to use importance measures to rank network hosts and vulnerabilities, then combine these measures to prioritize the order of vulnerabilities to be patched. We show that nearly equivalent prioritized set of vulnerabilities can be computed in comparison to an exhaustive search method in various network scenarios, while the performance of computing the set is dramatically improved, while equivalent solutions are computed in various network scenarios.},

abstract={Autonomous vehicles increasingly rely on cameras to provide the input for perception and scene understanding and the ability of these models to classify their environment and objects, under adverse conditions and image noise is crucial. When the input is, either unintentionally or through targeted attacks, deteriorated, the reliability of autonomous vehicle is compromised. In order to mitigate such phenomena, we propose DriveGuard, a lightweight spatio-temporal autoencoder, as a solution to robustify the image segmentation process for autonomous vehicles. By first processing camera images with DriveGuard, we offer a more universal solution than having to re-train each perception model with noisy input. We explore the space of different autoencoder architectures and evaluate them on a diverse dataset created with real and synthetic images demonstrating that by exploiting spatio-temporal information combined with multi-component loss we significantly increase robustness against adverse image effects reaching within 5-6% of that of the original model on clean images.},

Forecasting models leveraging rich historical vulnerability disclosure data undoubtedly provide important insights to inform the cyber community with the anticipated risks. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for statistically analysing long-term vulnerability time series between January 1999 and January 2016. By utilising this sound framework, we initiated an important study on not only testing but also modelling persistent volatilities in the data. In sharp contrast to the existing models, we consider capturing both mean and conditional variance latent in the disclosure series. Through extensive empirical studies, a composite model is shown to effectively capture the sporadic nature of vulnerability time series. In addition, this paper paves the way for further study on the stochastic perspective of cyber vulnerability proliferation towards more accurate prediction models and better risk management.},

abstract={The reliability of existing Cyber-Physical Systems(CPSs) developed on the basis of deep neural networks is not guaranteed, because deep models have been proved vulnerable to adversarial attacks with imperceptible perturbations. Considering that deep 3D models have potential applications to a wide variety of CPSs with safety-critical requirements, such as autonomous driving systems, we explore the robustness of deep 3D object detection models under adversarial point cloud perturbations in this paper. A novel method to generate 3D adversarial examples is developed from point cloud perturbations, which are common in practice due to the inherent characteristics of the LiDAR data produced by the 3D sensors. The method has the ability to successfully attack deep 3D models in most cases, and thereby gives rise to a great real-world concern about object detection models due to their vulnerability to physical-world attacks in the form of point cloud perturbations. We conduct a thorough robustness evaluation of popular deep 3D object detectors in an adversarial setting on the KITTI dataset. Experimental results show that current deep 3D object detection models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, and their performances are decreased to a large extent in the presence of adversarial point clouds generated by the proposed method.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has become a critical infrastructure in smart city services. Unlike traditional network nodes, most of the current IoT devices are constrained with limited capabilities. Moreover, frequent changes in the network status (e.g., nodes turns into the sleep mode to save battery) make it even more difficult to set up a stable, secure transmission among smart city IoT devices. On the one hand, these weaknesses make the IoT more vulnerable to attacks, such as data eavesdropping, which can monitor, tamper, and obtain the transporting data. On the other hand, the high-confidence smart city service strongly relies on the security of data transporting among the IoT devices, e.g., data being tempered would reduce the reliability of smart city services and data being monitored or stolen would infringe the privacy of smart city services. Toward high-confidence smart city IoT services, we proposed an approach to secure the data transportation among the smart city IoT devices, which combines a k-n secret-sharing mechanism and software-defined networking (SDN) technique to securely transport IoT data. Specifically, the data are transported by multiple routes calculated by the SDN controller adaptively. Data safety is guaranteed by the all-or-nothing feature of the k-n secret-sharing mechanism. Two SDN-based transmission strategies, which leverage the SDN's advantages on network management, and scheduling, are applied to overcome the challenges of the unstable network state in IoT. Extensive experiments conducted from many aspects show that the proposed approach can remarkably reduce the attack success rate with reasonable and acceptable overhead.},

abstract={Integration of power and gas systems has been recently proposed as a portfolio solution to deal with the sporadic availability of renewables and enhance the flexibility of power systems. In an integrated system, where critical operating information and control signals of both systems need to be communicated, the risk of cyber attack is intensified. In this article, we present a new model for the integration of power and gas systems using power-to-gas (PtG) and gas-fired generation (GfG) facilities. We demonstrate how the operation of the integrated system can be adversely impacted during cyber attacks that may not be detected using traditional methods. We propose two new detection schemes for false data injection attacks against the input and output signals of the PtG/GfG facility scheduler. In the first scheme, a supervised machine-learning technique, based on the convolutional neural network and wavelet transforms, is adopted to detect attacks on the information received by the facility scheduler. In the second scheme, a hybrid neural network is developed, based on an unsupervised learning technique, that requires no labeled training information to detect attacks on the output control signals issued by the scheduler. In both schemes, information acquired from local sensors and deterministic estimation methods is utilized for signal evaluation. The proposed schemes are incorporated into the facilities' scheduler to create a cyber-attack resilient scheduling model in an integrated power and gas grid. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are evaluated via numerical studies using the IEEE30-bus power system integrated with the Belgian gas grid as the test bed using historical operating parameters.},

Deep learning architectures are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, but previous work has focused on the application of adversarial examples to classification tasks. Deep generative models have recently become popular due to their ability to model input data distributions and generate realistic examples from those distributions. We present three classes of attacks on the VAE and VAE-GAN architectures and demonstrate them against networks trained on MNIST, SVHN and CelebA. Our first attack leverages classification-based adversaries by attaching a classifier to the trained encoder of the target generative model, which can then be used to indirectly manipulate the latent representation. Our second attack directly uses the VAE loss function to generate a target reconstruction image from the adversarial example. Our third attack moves beyond relying on classification or the standard loss for the gradient and directly optimizes against differences in source and target latent representations. We also motivate why an attacker might be interested in deploying such techniques against a target generative network.},

abstract={Android's permission system offers an all-or-nothing choice when installing an app. To make it more flexible and fine-grained, users may choose a popular app tool, called permission manager, to selectively grant or revoke an app's permissions at runtime. A fundamental requirement for such permission manager is that the granted or revoked permissions should be enforced faithfully. However, we discover that none of existing permission managers meet this requirement due to permission leaks, in which an unprivileged app can exercise certain permissions which are revoked or not-granted through communicating with a privileged app.To address this problem, we propose a secure, usable, and transparent OS-level middleware for any permission manager to defend against the permission leaks. The middleware is provably secure in a sense that it can effectively block all possible permission leaks.The middleware is designed to have a minimal impact on the usability of running apps. In addition, the middleware is transparent to users and app developers and it requires minor modifications on permission managers and Android OS. Finally, our evaluation shows that the middleware incurs relatively low performance overhead and power consumption.},

With KVM, heterogeneous operating systems can be installed in Virtual Machines (VMs) in an homogeneous environment. However, it has been shown that various breaches due to software defects may cause damages on such a cloud ecosystem. We propose a new Virtualization Introspection System (VIS) to protect the host as well as VMs running on a KVM-based cloud structure from malicious attacks. VIS detects and intercepts attacks from VMs by collecting their static and dynamic status. We then replay the attacks on VMs and leverage artificial intelligence techniques to derive effective decision rules with unsupervised learning nature.

abstract={Security issues have been accompanied by the development of the artificial intelligence industry. Machine learning has been widely used for fraud detection, spam detection, and malicious file detection, since it has the ability to dig the value of big data. However, for malicious attackers, there is a strong motivation to evade such algorithms. Because attackers do not know the specific parameters of the machine model, they can only carry out a black box attack. This paper proposes a method based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network(WGAN) to generate malicious PDF files which are similar to benign ones and can evade the malicious file detection system. The experimental results show that the adversarial examples generated by our method can evade the PDF classifier-PDFrate of 100%. We also test their performance in different classifiers and the results show that our proposed method can evade the classifiers of different machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.},

abstract={It is known that 75% of international freight is through maritime transportation. Indeed, as international trade increases, ports face the pressure to improve their infrastructure in order to maintain their operations and respond to market demands. Given such high level of competition, ports ought to leverage their resources efficiently and effectively, which has resulted in increased automation capabilities and the adoption of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). For such reasons, the container terminal sector is increasingly becoming susceptible to various types of debilitating threats. While a plethora of research efforts, from both, the control and cyber perspectives have been dedicated to tackling the security of CPS in such sectors, there still exists a significant gap, which is rendered by the lack of properly comprehending and accurately characterizing malicious attackers' capabilities, intents and aims, when targeting such systems. This is largely due to the lack of real malicious empirical data that can be captured, inferred, and analyzed from within the boundaries of such operational CPS realms. Undoubtedly, the goal which endeavors to capture notions of “true maliciousness” in the context of such CPS is significantly challenging, due to many factors, including, (1) the lack of complete maturity and the scarcity of elaborative technical details related to such CPS, (2) the significant diversity of such types of systems, and (3) logistic and privacy constraints which are often strictly enforced by CPS owners and operators. To this end, this paper presents a first step towards inferring tangible notions of maliciousness in the context of maritime transportation. This is accomplished through innovating various mechanisms, namely, investigating passive darknet Internet-scale traffic, instrumenting and analyzing millions of recent CPS malware samples, and deploying tailored, highly-interactive CPS honeypots. Additionally, we analyze the effect of a derived empirical attack, namely, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, using a discrete event simulation in the context of a vessel passing a canal. We postulate that the envisioned derived attack models and their associated impact could be effectively exploited to successfully provide CPS marine transportation security and resiliency.},

abstract={Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) can be gathered from multiple sources, and Twitter is one such open source platform where a large volume and variety of threat data is shared every day. The automated and timely mining of relevant threat knowledge from this data can be crucial for enrichment of existing threat intelligence platforms to proactively defend against cyber attacks. We propose CTI-Twitter: a novel frame-work combining supervised and unsupervised learning models to collect, process, analyze and generate threat specific knowledge from tweets coming from multiple users. CTI-Twitter has multi-fold contributions: i) first collecting tweets through Twitter API, ii) extracting relevant threat tweets from irrelevant ones, and classifying relevant ones into multiple classes of threats iii) then grouping tweets belonging to each class using topic modeling iv) finally performing data enrichment and verification process. We evaluate our proposed model on real-time tweets collected for about four months (in year 2020) using Twitter API. The encouraging results obtained indicate the effectiveness of CTI-Twitter in terms of timeliness and discovery of trending attacks patterns, and vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are large-scale, geographically dispersed, and life-critical systems, in which lots of sensors and actuators are embedded and networked together to facilitate real-time monitoring and closed-loop control. Their intrinsic features in geographic space and resources put forward to urgent requirements of reliability and scalability for designed filtering or control schemes. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of distributed filtering and control of industrial CPSs described by differential dynamics models. Special attention is paid to sensor networks, manipulators, and power systems. For real-time monitoring, some typical Kalman-based distributed algorithms are summarized and their performances on calculation burden and communication burden, as well as scalability, are discussed in depth. Then, the characteristics of non-Kalman cases are further disclosed in light of constructed filter structures. Furthermore, the latest development is surveyed for distributed cooperative control of mobile manipulators and distributed model predictive control in industrial automation systems. By resorting to droop characteristics, representative distributed control strategies classified by controller structures are systematically summarized for power systems with the requirements of power sharing and voltage and frequency regulation. In addition, distributed security control of industrial CPSs is reviewed when cyber-attacks are taken into consideration. Finally, some challenges are raised to guide the future research.},

abstract={DDoS has now become the most severe security problem of the Internet. Without in time report, DDoS attack can knock down the victim in no time by exhausting the victim's computing and communicating resources. In this paper we propose STDC-a DDoS defense system. STDC is a two-stage system based on clustering. In the first stage STDC leverage the benefit of SDN and NFV to apply flow-based detection method. STDC use the flow information gathered to do clustering. Since we use cluster analysis as the basic detection algorithm, STDC can separate the DDoS attacks from the legitimate flush crowd easily. In the second stage, we extract attack traffic pattern from the clustering result of the first stage to make blocking rules and use the structure of SDN to quickly dispatch them to achieve effictive and efficient DDoS mitigation. We test STDC using public DDoS dataset and the traffic captured through the gateway. Both of the experiments achieve good detection percision and high filtering ratio.},

abstract={The performance of most speaker diarization systems with x-vector embeddings is both vulnerable to noisy environments and lacks domain robustness. Earlier work on speaker diarization using generative adversarial network (GAN) with an encoder network (ClusterGAN) to project input x-vectors into a latent space has shown promising performance on meeting data. In this paper, we extend the ClusterGAN network to improve diarization robustness and enable rapid generalization across various challenging domains. To this end, we fetch the pre-trained encoder from the ClusterGAN and fine tune it by using prototypical loss (meta-ClusterGAN or MCGAN) under the meta-learning paradigm. Experiments are conducted on CALLHOME telephonic conversations, AMI meeting data, DIHARD-II (dev set) which includes challenging multi-domain corpus, and two child-clinician interaction corpora (ADOS, BOSCC) related to the autism spectrum disorder domain. Extensive analyses of the experimental data are done to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed ClusterGAN and MCGAN embeddings over x-vectors. The results show that the proposed embeddings with normalized maximum eigengap spectral clustering (NME-SC) back-end consistently outperform the Kaldi state-of-the-art x-vector diarization system. Finally, we employ embedding fusion with x-vectors to provide further improvement in diarization performance. We achieve a relative diarization error rate (DER) improvement of 6.67% to 53.93% on the aforementioned datasets using the proposed fused embeddings over x-vectors. Besides, the MCGAN embeddings provide better performance in the number of speakers estimation and short speech segment diarization compared to x-vectors and ClusterGAN on telephonic conversations.},

abstract={In order to solve the problem of high false positive in network intrusion detection systems, we adopted clustering algorithms, the K-means algorithm and the Fuzzy C Mean (FCM) algorithm, to identify false alerts, to reduce invalid alerts and to purify alerts for a better analysis. In this paper, we first introduced typical clustering algorithms, including the partition clustering, the hierarchical clustering, the density and grid clustering, and the fuzzy clustering, and then analyzed their feasibilities in security data processing. Furthermore, we introduced an intrusion detection framework, and tested the validity and feasibility of false positive elimination in intrusion detection. The process steps of false positive elimination were clearly described, and additionally, two typical clustering algorithms, the K-means algorithm and the FCM algorithm, were implemented for false alerts identification and filtration. Also, we defined three evaluation indexes: the elimination rate, the false elimination rate and the miss elimination rate. Accordingly, we used DARPA 2000 LLDOS1.0 dataset for our experiments, and adopted Snort as our intrusion detection system. Eventually, the results showed that the method proposed by us has a satisfactory validity and feasibility in false positive elimination, and the clustering algorithms we adopted can achieve a high elimination rate.},

abstract={Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful and hence most widely used technique for recommender systems. However, it is vulnerable to shilling attack due to its open nature, which results in generating biased or false recommendations for users. In literature, segment attack (push attack) has been widely studied and investigated while rare studies have been performed on nuke attack, to the best of our knowledge. Further, the robustness of binary collaborative filtering and hybrid approach has not been investigated against segment-focused attack. In this paper, from the perspective of robustness, binary collaborative filtering, hybrid approach, stand-alone rating user-based, and stand-alone rating item- based recommendation have been evaluated against segment attack on a large dataset (100K ratings) which is found to be more successful as it attacks target set of items. With an aim to find an approach which reflects a higher accuracy in recommending items and is less vulnerable to segment-based attack, the possibility of any relationship between accuracy and vulnerability of six CF approaches were studied. Such an approach needs to be re-examined by the researchers marking the future of recommender system (RS). Experimental results show negligible positive correlation between accuracy and vulnerability of techniques. Publicly available dataset namely MovieLens was used for conducting experiments. Robustness and accuracy of CF techniques were calculated using prediction shift and F-measure, respectively.},

Music on Demand (MoD), over IVR, is one such industry where the user interacts with the dialogue system to play music using voice commands only. Domain adaptation of the model is expected to perform well on this domain as systems trained on public datasets are very generic in nature and not very domain-specific. To train the ASR for MoD, we experiment with the HMM-based classical approach and DeepSpeech2 on Voxforge dataset. We then fine-tune the DeepSpeech2 model on MoD data. With very limited data and little finetuning of the model, we were able to achieve 14.727% Word Error Rate (WER).},

abstract={Deep learning has shown its power in many applications, including object detection in images, natural-language understanding, and speech recognition. To make it more accessible to end users, many deep learning models are now embedded in mobile apps. Compared to offloading deep learning from smartphones to the cloud, performing machine learning on-device can help improve latency, connectivity, and power consumption. However, most deep learning models within Android apps can easily be obtained via mature reverse engineering, while the models' exposure may invite adversarial attacks. In this study, we propose a simple but effective approach to hacking deep learning models using adversarial attacks by identifying highly similar pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. All 10 real-world Android apps in the experiment are successfully attacked by our approach. Apart from the feasibility of the model attack, we also carry out an empirical study that investigates the characteristics of deep learning models used by hundreds of Android apps on Google Play. The results show that many of them are similar to each other and widely use fine-tuning techniques to pre-trained models on the Internet.},

year={2021},
volume={16},

pages={553-568},
abstract={Gait authentication, especially sensor-based patterns, has been studied by researchers for decades. Nowadays, gait authentication has become an important facet of biometric systems due to the so-called unique characteristics of each user. With the development of various technologies (i.e., hardware, data processing, features extraction, and learning algorithms), the performance of sensor-based authentication methods is gradually improving. But we have found that the vulnerability of most existing methods can be compromised easily. In this paper, we propose a novel attack model, called one cycle attack, to bypass existing gait authentication methods. Firstly, the gait sequence is divided into multiple gait cycles. By adopting the K-mean algorithm, we get the average distance of each feature sample (extracted from the gait cycle) to its closest cluster center, and its result confirms that independent individuals may have similar gait cycles. Secondly, using six state-of-the-art models it was found that the adversarial gait cycle found with the clustering method can bypass the victim's model rapidly. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of sensor-based gait authentication methods to fight against attacks, we present a WPD-LSTM (Wavelet Packet Decomposition and Long Short-Term Memory) multi-cycle defense model which considers the contextual contents of the neighboring gait cycles in the gait sequence. Experimental results on two datasets (the largest public sensor-based gait database OU-ISIR and new dataset from our laboratory) show that our attack model can bypass most of the victims' models within a limited number of attempts. Specifically, we can compromise 20%-80% of users within 5 attempts by utilizing imitation. On the contrary, the success rate of attackers has been greatly mitigated by deploying our multi-cycle defense model.},

abstract={Recently, threat of previously unknown cyber-attacks are increasing because existing security systems are not able to detect them. Past cyber-attacks had simple purposes of leaking personal information by attacking the PC or destroying the system. However, the goal of recent hacking attacks has changed from leaking information and destruction of services to attacking large-scale systems such as critical infrastructures and state agencies. In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks. We expect our model to be the basis of the future Advanced Persistent Threat(APT) detection and prevention system implementations.},

abstract={Models based on deep learning are prone to misjudging the results when faced with adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose an MCTS-T algorithm for generating adversarial examples of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The MCTS algorithm enables the generation model to provide a reward value that reflects the probability of generative examples bypassing the detector. To guarantee the antagonism and feasibility of the generative adversarial examples, the bypassing rules are restricted. The experimental results indicate that the missed detection rate of adversarial examples is significantly improved after the MCTS-T generation algorithm. Additionally, we construct a generative adversarial network (GAN) to optimize the detector and improve the detection rate when dealing with adversarial examples. After several epochs of adversarial training, the accuracy of detecting adversarial examples is significantly improved.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a very important role in national critical infrastructures. However, the growing interaction between the modern ICS and the Internet has made ICS more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In order to protect ICS from malicious attacks, intrusion detection technology emerges. By analyzing the network meta data or the industrial process data, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can identify attacks that violate communication protocols or system specifications. However, the existing intrusion detection technology is not omnipotent, which opens up a back door for some more advanced attacks. In this work, we design an enhanced multi-stage semantic attack against ICS, which is undetectable by existing IDS. By hijacking the communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the remote Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the attacker can manipulate the measurement data and control instructions simultaneously. The fake measurement data deceives the human operator into making wrong decisions. Furthermore, the attacker can strategically manipulate the semantic meaning of control instructions according to system state transition rules. In the meanwhile, a fake view of measurement data is presented to the HMI to conceal the on-going malicious attack. This attack is totally stealthy since the message sizes and timing, the command sequences, and the system state values are all legitimate. Consequently, this attack can secretly bring the system into critical states. Experimental results have verified the strong attack ability of the proposed attack.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack by using the reinforcement learning to learn the characteristics of the target classifier C. Our method does not need to find a substitute classifier that resembles C with respect to its structure and parameters. Instead, our method learns an optimal attacking policy of guiding the attacker to build an adversarial image from the original image. We work on the feature space of images, instead of the pixels of images directly. Our method achieves better results on many measures. Our method achieves 94.5 % attack success rate on a well-trained digit classifier. Our adversarial images have better imperceptibility even though the norm distances to original images are larger than other methods. Since our method works on the characteristics of a classifier, it has better transferability. The transfer rate of our method could reach 52.1 % for a targeted class and 65.9% for a non-targeted class. This improves over previous results of single-digit transfer rates. Also, we show that it is harder to defend our attack by incorporating defense mechanisms, such as MagNet, which uses a denoising technique. We show that our method achieves 65% attack success rate even though the target classifier employs MagNet to defend.},

abstract={The large-scale connectivity of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an important challenge for the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Intelligence vulnerability analysis is an excellent solution. However, existing methods for analyzing connectivity vulnerability have ignored the existence of critical areas in the system. Due to the heterogeneities of the IoV environments and services, the failure of some specific areas may seriously damage connectivity and system performance. To this end, in this paper we focus on both the dynamic connectivity and the critical-area integrity, and propose an intelligent vulnerability analysis method to effectively identify the critical area of extreme vulnerability. Specifically, we consider an intelligent analysis scenario in which roadside servers continuously learn IoV heterogeneous environment and dynamic topology, and then translate the learning results into a flexible disruption cost problem. Based on this, we utilize the spectral partitioning method to identify the minimum-cost set of topological elements whose failure not only severely damages system connectivity but also disrupts its critical areas. Furthermore, we confirm that the identified set can be used to optimize disruption cost problem, thus intelligently improving vulnerability. Simulation results show that our proposed method can effectively identify vulnerable elements and prevent significant loss in the IoV system connectivity and performance.},

abstract={In recent years, the smart grid has been recognized as an important form of the Internet of Things application. In the smart grid, as an energy-based cyber-physical system, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) will be developed to monitor and control the power grid by integrating computing and networking components to ensure stable and efficient operation. The AMI is vulnerable to cyber attacks, especially data integrity attacks. There have been a number of research efforts on detecting such attacks. Nonetheless, most of existing schemes either rely on predefined thresholds or require external knowledge. This may lead to low detection accuracy when the thresholds are improperly defined, and where there is a lack of the external knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Gaussian-mixture model-based detection scheme to mitigate data integrity attacks. Not relying upon the predefined thresholds or external knowledge, our developed scheme operates through narrowing the range of normal data, which can be obtained through clustering the historical data and learning minimum and maximum values or distance values to each center of individual clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we conduct performance simulation based on the ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014 data set, and then analyze the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with respect to detection accuracy and overhead. The results of our investigation show that our scheme could achieve a higher detection rate, and a lower error rate, in comparison to existing schemes based on the Min-Max model.},

abstract={Advances in computing, communications, sensors, and cloud computing have resulted in the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) which forms a foundation for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Cyber-physical attacks can cause tangible effects in the physical world. The attacker's goal is to disrupt the normal operations of the CPS for example: equipment overstress, safety limits violation, damage to the product quality, safety compliance violation etc. The continued rise of cyber-attacks together with the evolving skills of the attackers, and the inefficiency of the traditional security algorithms to defend against advanced and sophisticated attacks such as Distributed Denial of service (DDoS), slow DoS and zero-day, necessitate the development of novel defense and resilient detection techniques compared to traditional approaches like signature and behavior-based methods. To deal with this, we propose a novel approach for learning detection model that includes operational and network data to detect advanced attacks. More precisely, our approach is able to learn a relational network that connects events at different system layers so that attacks can be identified with higher confidence level. In this paper, we propose a decision model by learning a set of constraints/relations from the data that conjunctively defines the normal operation of a CPS. The solutions of the decision model characterize the normal states of a given CPS. The malicious operations are detected when one or more constraints fail for a given state of CPS.

abstract={Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are vulnerable to targeted training data manipulations such as poisoning attacks and label flips. By carefully manipulating a subset of training samples, the attacker forces the learner to compute an incorrect decision boundary, thereby causing misclassifications. Considering the increased importance of SVMs in engineering and life-critical applications, we develop a novel defense algorithm that improves resistance against such attacks. Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) is a promising metric that characterizes the outlierness of data samples. In this work, we introduce a new approximation of LID called K-LID that uses kernel distance in the LID calculation, which allows LID to be calculated in high dimensional transformed spaces. We introduce a weighted SVM against such attacks using K-LID as a distinguishing characteristic that de-emphasizes the effect of suspicious data samples on the SVM decision boundary. Each sample is weighted on how likely its K-LID value is from the benign K-LID distribution rather than the attacked K-LID distribution. Experiments with benchmark data sets show that the proposed defense reduces classification error rates substantially (10% on average).},

As a result of applying MTD techniques to the system, an attacker would have more difficulties in exploiting a vulnerabilities of the target system. This study proposes an evaluation method of MTD systems combined with several different MTD techniques. The proposed method is a primary step in designing an evaluation model for the effectiveness of MTD. The main goal is to estimate the attack success ratio on the MTD systems mitigating from threats of executable binary file or malware injection. With the proposed evaluation method, we expect to prove that the MTD technology can enhance the security of a web server, and can be applied in a real-world information system. As our preliminary work done, we set up a prototype framework to validate the proposed work in a pseudo-experimental environment.},

abstract={The load frequency control (LFC) system is an essential component of the smart grid and is located between cyberspace information and the physical infrastructure. Because the operation of LFC depends on the modern network communication technology, it is vulnerable to network attacks. The false data injection attack (FDIA) injects attack data into the data collected by the LFC system, affecting the control center's calculation and causing errors in the control signals, which affects the stable operation of the power system. For the LFC system, this article builds a cyber-physical model. Based on the model, an FDIA detection and defense mechanism based on the GAN network is proposed. By calculating, contrasting, and replacing the control signals, the proposed method can detect and defend against FDIAs. The experimental results on the two-area interconnected power system, the IEEE 39-bus, and IEEE 118-bus power system show that the proposed defense method can ensure the power system frequency and tie-line power deviation remain within the set value when suffered from FDIA.},

abstract={Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the future envisioned networking paradigm used to provide fast and efficient content dissemination with interest-based content retrieval, name-based routing and in-network content caching. On the one hand, this new breed of future Internet architecture is becoming a key technology for data dissemination in the IoT networks; on the other hand, NDN suffers from new challenges in terms of data security. Among them, a content poisoning attack is the most common data security challenge. The aim of this attack is to inject poisoned content with an invalid signature to the network. Therefore, to prevent NDN against possible content poisoning attack, a signature of the contents is appended to each data packet for verifications. In this paper, we propose an identity-based signature scheme for IoT-based NDN networks, with a special emphasis on content integrity and authenticity. The proposed scheme is based on the concept of the Hyperelliptic curves, which provide the same level of security as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Bilinear pairing and Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) with lower-key size. The proposed scheme is subject to both formal and informal security analysis in order to show the feasibility of our scheme. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed via comparison with the relevant existing schemes that authenticates the superiority of our scheme in terms of security and efficiency.},

abstract={The environmental concerns, the limited availability of conventional energy sources, the integration of alternative energy sources and the increasing number of power-demanding appliances change the way electricity is generated and distributed. Smart Grid (SG) is an appealing concept, which was developed in response to the emerging issues of electricity generation and distribution. By leveraging the latest advancements of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), it offers significant benefits to energy providers, retailers and consumers. Nevertheless, SG is vulnerable to cyber attacks, that could cause critical economic and ecological consequences. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are becoming less efficient in detecting and mitigating cyberattacks, due to their limited capabilities of analyzing the exponentially increasing volume of network traffic. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) platform, which features a Big Data enabled IDS that timely detects and identifies cyber attacks against SG components. In order to validate the efficiency of the SPEAR platform regarding the protection of critical infrastructure, we installed the platform in a small wind power plant.},

This contrasts with previous work in the area that stops at the clustering step. We evaluated C2BID experimentally with two datasets, obtaining better F-Score than previous solutions.},

abstract={Autonomous robots and humans need to create a coherent 3D representation of their peripersonal space in order to interact with nearby objects. Recent studies in visual neuroscience suggest that the small coordinated head/eye movements that humans continually perform during fixation provides useful depth information. In this work, we mimic such a behavior on a humanoid robot and propose a computational model that extracts depth information without requiring the kinematic model of the robot. First, we show that, during fixational head/eye movements, proprioceptive cues and optic flow lie on a low dimensional subspace that is a function of the depth of the target. Then, we use the generative adaptive subspace self-organizing map (GASSOM) to learn these depth-dependent subspaces. The depth of the target is eventually decoded using a winner-take-all strategy. The proposed model is validated on a simulated model of the iCub robot.},

abstract={Misspelled keywords have become an appealing target in search poisoning, since they are less competitive to promote than the correct queries and account for a considerable amount of search traffic. Search engines have adopted several countermeasure strategies, e.g., Google applies automated corrections on queried keywords and returns search results of the corrected versions directly. However, a sophisticated class of attack, which we term as linguistic-collision misspelling, can evade auto-correction and poison search results. Cybercriminals target special queries where the misspelled terms are existent words, even in other languages (e.g., "idobe", a misspelling of the English word "adobe", is a legitimate word in the Nigerian language). In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis on linguistic-collision search poisoning attacks. In particular, we check 1.77 million misspelled search terms on Google and Baidu and analyze both English and Chinese languages, which are the top two languages used by Internet users. We leverage edit distance operations and linguistic properties to generate misspelling candidates. To more efficiently identify linguistic-collision search terms, we design a deep learning model that can improve collection rate by 2.84x compared to random sampling. Our results show that the abuse is prevalent: around 1.19% of linguistic-collision search terms on Google and Baidu have results on the first page directing to malicious websites. We also find that cybercriminals mainly target categories of gambling, drugs, and adult content. Mobile-device users disproportionately search for misspelled keywords, presumably due to small screen for input. Our work highlights this new class of search engine poisoning and provides insights to help mitigate the threat.},

abstract={Integration of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) into the distribution system makes today's power grid more remotely monitored and controlled than it has been. The fast increasing connectivity, however, also implies that the distribution grid today, or smart grid, is more vulnerable. Thus, research into intrusion/anomaly detection systems at the distribution level is in critical need. Current research on Intrusion Detection Systems for the power grid has been focused primarily on cyber security at the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition, and single node levels with little attention on coordinated cyberattacks at multiple nodes. A holistic approach toward system-wide cyber security for distribution systems is yet to be developed. This paper presents a novel approach toward intrusion prevention, using a multi-agent system, at the distribution system level. Simulations of the method have been performed on the IEEE 13-Node Test Feeder, and the results compared to those obtained from existing methods. The results have validated the performance of the proposed method for protection against cyber intrusions at the distribution system level.},

abstract={The increasing availability of healthcare data requires accurate analysis of disease diagnosis, progression, and real-time monitoring to provide improved treatments to the patients. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) models are used to extract valuable features and insights from high-dimensional and heterogeneous healthcare data to detect different diseases and patient activities in a Smart Healthcare System (SHS). However, recent researches show that ML models used in different application domains are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial attacks to exploit the ML classifiers used in a SHS. We consider an adversary who has partial knowledge of data distribution, SHS model, and ML algorithm to perform both targeted and untargeted attacks. Employing these adversarial capabilities, we manipulate medical device readings to alter patient status (disease-affected, normal condition, activities, etc.) in the outcome of the SHS. Our attack utilizes five different adversarial ML algorithms (HopSkipJump, Fast Gradient Method, Crafting Decision Tree, Carlini & Wagner, Zeroth Order optimization) to perform different malicious activities (e.g., data poisoning, misclassify outputs, etc.) on a SHS. Moreover, based on the training and testing phase capabilities of an adversary, we perform white box and black box attacks on a SHS. We evaluate the performance of our work in different SHS settings and medical devices. Our extensive evaluation shows that our proposed adversarial attack can significantly degrade the performance of a ML-based SHS in detecting diseases and normal activities of the patients correctly, which eventually leads to erroneous treatment.},

abstract={Millirobots are a promising robotic platform for many applications due to their small size and low manufacturing costs. Legged millirobots, in particular, can provide increased mobility in complex environments and improved scaling of obstacles. However, controlling these small, highly dynamic, and underactuated legged systems is difficult. Hand-engineered controllers can sometimes control these legged millirobots, but they have difficulties with dynamic maneuvers and complex terrains. We present an approach for controlling a real-world legged millirobot that is based on learned neural network models. Using less than 17 minutes of data, our method can learn a predictive model of the robot's dynamics that can enable effective gaits to be synthesized on the fly for following user-specified waypoints on a given terrain. Furthermore, by leveraging expressive, high-capacity neural network models, our approach allows for these predictions to be directly conditioned on camera images, endowing the robot with the ability to predict how different terrains might affect its dynamics. This enables sample-efficient and effective learning for locomotion of a dynamic legged millirobot on various terrains, including gravel, turf, carpet, and styrofoam.

abstract={Mobile cyber-physical systems, such as automobiles, drones and robotic vehicles, are gradually becoming attractive targets for cyber attacks. This is a challenge because intrusion detection systems built for conventional computer systems tend to be unsuitable. They can be too demanding for resource-restricted cyber-physical systems or too inaccurate due to the lack of real-world data on actual attack behaviours. Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks. We observe that the addition of physical input features can markedly reduce the false positive rate and increase the overall accuracy of the detection.},

abstract={Due to the lightweight features, the combination of container technology and microservice architecture makes container-based cloud environment more efficient and agile than VM-based cloud environment. However, it also greatly amplifies the dynamism and complexity of the cloud environment and increases the uncertainty of security issues in the system concurrently. In this case, the effectiveness of defense mechanisms with fixed strategies would fluctuate as the updates occur in cloud environment. We refer this problem as effectiveness drift problem of defense mechanisms, which is particularly acute in the proactive defense mechanisms, such as moving target defense (MTD). To tackle this problem, we present DSEOM, a framework that can automatically perceive updates of container-based cloud environment, rapidly evaluate the effectiveness change of MTD and dynamically optimize MTD strategies. Specifically, we establish a multi-dimensional attack graphs model to formalize various complex attack scenarios. Combining with this model, we introduce the concept of betweenness centrality to effectively evaluate and optimize the implementation strategies of MTD. In addition, we present a series of security and performance metrics to quantify the effectiveness of MTD strategies in DSEOM. And we conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the existence of the effectiveness drift problem and demonstrate the usability and scalability of DSEOM.},

abstract={Automatic analysis of coronary artery in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is important for clinicians to diagnose and evaluate coronary artery disease (CAD). Often there are two analysis tasks involved: centerline extraction and lumen segmentation, which are related yet often treated separately in the literature. In this work, we leverage their mutual relationship and propose an automatic approach for joint centerline extraction and lumen segmentation from CCTA using a hybrid of deep learning models. Our approach features the following designs, including: (i) the use of CNNTracker that traces out the centerline from seeds to detected ostia or the end of vessels, which fixes the breakage issue commonly found in previous pixel-based segmentation methods; (ii) a vascular Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that leverages the geometric shape prior for accurate mesh-based lumen segmentation; (iii) the alternation between CNNTracker and GCN that refines the centerline and reduces the drift in tracking. We experiment the proposed method on CCTA data from 101 patients and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both centerline extraction and lumen segmentation of the right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending (LAD), and left circumflex (LCX).},

pages={46584-46594},
abstract={Kernels of operating systems are written in low-level unsafe languages, which make them inevitably vulnerable to memory corruption attacks. Most existing kernel defense mechanisms focus on preventing control-data attacks. Recently, attackers have turned the direction to non-control-data attacks by hijacking data flow, so as to bypass current defense mechanisms. Previous work has proved that noncontrol-data attacks are the critical threat to kernels. One of the important purposes of these attacks is to achieve privilege escalation by overwriting sensitive kernel data. The goal of our research is to develop a lightweight protection mechanism to mitigate non-control-data attacks that compromise sensitive kernel data. We propose an approach that enforces data integrity of sensitive kernel data by preventing the illegal write to these data to mitigate privilege escalation attacks. The main challenge of the proposed approach is to validate the modification of sensitive kernel data at runtime. The validation routine must verify the legitimacy of the duplicated sensitive data and ensure the credibility of the verification. To address this challenge, we modify the system call entry point to monitor the change of the sensitive kernel data without any change to Linux access control mechanism. Then, we use stack canaries to protect the duplication of sensitive kernel data that are used for integrity checking. In addition, we protect the integrity of sensitive kernel data by forbidding illegal updates to them. We have implemented the prototype for Linux kernel on Ubuntu Linux platform. The evaluation results of our prototype demonstrate that it can mitigate privilege escalation attacks and its performance overhead is moderate.},

abstract={Word embeddings, i.e., low-dimensional vector representations such as GloVe and SGNS, encode word "meaning" in the sense that distances between words' vectors correspond to their semantic proximity. This enables transfer learning of semantics for a variety of natural language processing tasks.Word embeddings are typically trained on large public corpora such as Wikipedia or Twitter. We demonstrate that an attacker who can modify the corpus on which the embedding is trained can control the "meaning" of new and existing words by changing their locations in the embedding space. We develop an explicit expression over corpus features that serves as a proxy for distance between words and establish a causative relationship between its values and embedding distances. We then show how to use this relationship for two adversarial objectives: (1) make a word a top-ranked neighbor of another word, and (2) move a word from one semantic cluster to another.An attack on the embedding can affect diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating for the first time the power of data poisoning in transfer learning scenarios. We use this attack to manipulate query expansion in information retrieval systems such as resume search, make certain names more or less visible to named entity recognition models, and cause new words to be translated to a particular target word regardless of the language. Finally, we show how the attacker can generate linguistically likely corpus modifications, thus fooling defenses that attempt to filter implausible sentences from the corpus using a language model.},

abstract={As cyber attacks are growing with an unprecedented rate in the recent years, organizations are seeking an efficient and scalable solution towards a holistic protection system. As the adversaries are becoming more skilled and organized, traditional rule based detection systems have been proved to be quite ineffective against the continuously evolving cyber attacks. Consequently, security researchers are focusing on applying machine learning techniques and big data analytics to defend against cyber attacks. Over the recent years, several anomaly detection systems have been claimed to be quite successful against the sophisticated cyber attacks including the previously unseen zero-day attacks. But often, these systems do not consider the adversary's adaptive attacking behavior for bypassing the detection procedure. As a result, deploying these systems in active real-world scenarios fails to provide significant benefits in the presence of intelligent adversaries that are carefully manipulating the attack vectors. In this work, we analyze the adversarial impact on anomaly detection models that are built upon centroid-based clustering from game-theoretic aspect and propose adversarial anomaly detection technique for these models. The experimental results show that our game-theoretic anomaly detection models can withstand attacks more effectively compared to the traditional models.},

Precise traffic analysis and monitoring has become a challenge since the traditional algorithms do not work well any more. To deal with the problem, many researchers extract a number of statistical features and propose some machine learning algorithms on the field of traffic analysis. In this paper, we utilize more distinctive representation of packet length and packet inter-arrival time. Meantime, we propose two deep learning approaches for better feature learning and compare them with the existing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. One model is Autoencoder for the purpose of extracting representative features. Another model is Convolutional Neural Network.

abstract={The development of civil aviation has led to flight operations generating massive datasets. Derived from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast technology, an eigengap-based automatic hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed, aiming to overcome the human intervention requirement of hierarchical clustering to determine the number of track clusters in the terminal area. First, the trajectory pair similarity matrix is calculated based on the Euclidean distance and an adaptive scale parameter. Second, the Laplace transformation is applied on the similarity matrix and the eigenvalues are obtained in order to determine the number of clusters. Finally, the hierarchical clustering algorithm divides the terminal area trajectory into several sub-categories. Taking a terminal approach trajectory as an example, simulation analysis is performed, with results revealing that the algorithm divides 404 north-south-oriented aircraft flight trajectories into 2 and 3 categories. Furthermore, the new-index is used to evaluate the clustering results, demonstrating its effectiveness is better than the automatic k-means algorithm. Our study provides support for reliability analysis of air traffic network in the terminal area.},

abstract={State-of-the-art attacks against cyclic logic obfuscation use satisfiability solvers that are equipped with a set of cycle-avoidance clauses. These cycle-avoidance clauses are generated in a preprocessing step and define various key combinations that could open or close cycles without making the circuit oscillating or stateful. In this article, we show that this preprocessing step has to generate cycle-avoidance conditions on all cycles in a netlist; otherwise, a missing cycle could trap the solver in an infinite loop or make it exit with an incorrect key. Then, we propose several techniques by which the number of cycles is exponentially increased as a function of the number of inserted feedback. We further illustrate that when the number of feedback is increased, the preprocessing step of the attack faces an exponential increase in complexity and runtime, preventing the correct composition of cycle-avoidance clauses in a reasonable time. On the other hand, if the preprocessing is not concluded, the attack formulated by the satisfiability solver will either get stuck or exit with an incorrect key. Hence, when the cyclic obfuscation under the conditions proposed in this article is implemented, it would impose an exponentially difficult problem for the satisfiability solver-based attacks.},

abstract={Recognizing the various and broad range of applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for personal, public and military applications, recent un-intentional malfunctions of uncontrollable UAVs or intentional attacks on them divert our attention and motivate us to devise a protection system, referred to as a counter UAV system (CUS). The CUS, also known as a counter-drone system, protects personal, commercial, public, and military facilities and areas from uncontrollable and belligerent UAVs by neutralizing or destroying them. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the CUS to describe the key technologies of the CUS and provide sufficient information with wich to comprehend this system. The first part starts with an introduction of general UAVs and the concept of the CUS. In the second part, we provide an extensive survey of the CUS through a top-down approach: i) the platform of CUS including ground and sky platforms and related networks; ii) the architecture of the CUS consisting of sensing systems, command-and-control (C2) systems, and mitigation systems; and iii) the devices and functions with the sensors for detection-and-identification and localization-and-tracking actions and mitigators for neutralization. The last part is devoted to a survey of the CUS market with relevant challenges and future visions. From the CUS market survey, potential readers can identify the major players in a CUS industry and obtain information with which to develop the CUS industry. A broad understanding gained from the survey overall will assist with the design of a holistic CUS and inspire cross-domain research across physical layer designs in wireless communications, CUS network designs, control theory, mechanics, and computer science, to enhance counter UAV techniques further.},

abstract={To reduce external disturbances and achieve high vertical resolution, the scanning time for white-light interference microscopy is very short. Because capturing high-resolution (HR) images is time consuming, low-resolution (LR) images are acquired instead. However, HR images are more desirable because they contain more details. To ensure high vertical resolution and high image resolution, one feasible solution is to process the scanned LR images to HR images by single image super-resolution (SISR). In this paper, an interference image super-resolution (IISR) model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. The generator is based on the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) architecture. With the aim of acquiring more realistic images, the discriminator network is designed using a modified DenseNet architecture, in which the pooling layers are replaced with dilated convolutional layers. The perceptual loss is optimized, and the content loss is upgraded to a continuously differentiable piecewise function. Various microscopy images are tested, including images with and without interference fringes. The IISR model has been proven to restore LR images to HR images. The comparative experiments prove that the proposed model achieves better visual quality than other models, preserving more realistic details.},

abstract={World is moving rapidly towards the digital transformation. The internet across the world is growing rapidly which gives rise to many opportunities in every field including entertainment, finance, education, sports etc. As every coin has two aspects, the internet also has many advantages and disadvantages. We know about the advantages, but the only major disadvantage that everyone should be aware of is the increase in cyber-attacks. It is nothing, but the illegal activity committed on the internet. Many government websites and systems were hacked in the past few years and it has caused a huge loss to the nations like India, USA and China. These governments have already taken various steps to counter these crimes & attacks. But still, the attackers are coming up with new ways of attacking every time. There is need for some concrete solution which is not in the reach of the attackers. For developing such systems and tools we have done a deep analysis of various types of cybercrime and attacks happened in past along with existing solutions proposed by many researchers. Therefore, this paper presents a study on various cyber-attacks that were triggered in India and other countries in the past few years. The various prevention methods proposed in past to deal with these kinds of attacks. These prevention methods are based on machine learning algorithms like a random forest, k-means clustering, support vector machine and artificial neural network applied in order to prevent cyber-attacks. Also, in this paper, we have reported proposed intelligent system which is based supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to avoid these cyber-attacks. This proposed system might provide high efficiency with a minimum human intervention which can be implemented and used as a universal solution to most of the common cyber-attacks},

abstract={As a typical information physics system, the smart grid can realize the two-way transmission of information. The deep integration of the information physics system brings more risks to the system while improving the automation management level of the power system. The false data injection attack is a new type of attack method for power system state estimation. The attacker can bypass the traditional detection method to change the state estimation result, so that the control center makes wrong decisions and threatens the safe operation of the power grid. In this paper, we focus on the detection of false data injection attacks in smart grids. A DBN-based attack detection method is proposed. Unsupervised learning is performed from the bottom of the restricted Boltzmann machine to provide initial weight for the network. The backpropagation algorithm propagates the error from top to bottom and fine-tunes the model parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed detection method, simulation experiment is performed in the IEEE standard test system. We set different contrast scenarios to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the detection model. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance with comparison to the SVM based detection approach.},

abstract={The features in facial images, which are utilized for a variety of technological applications, pose a significant privacy concern for users. This paper proposes a method for protecting privacy in facial images based on the principal components of adversarial segmented image blocks. Generative adversarial network parameters are compressed by segmenting the facial images into blocks and extracting the principal components of the segmented image. The generator and discriminator in the generative adversarial network then generate images similar to the original facial images; the facial images generated by the generator, as-driven by the target recognition network, markedly different from the original facial images. As the generator, discriminator, and target recognition network compete with each other, minor perturbation is added to the principal components of the facial images to protect the users' privacy and prevent distinct face-related features of the images from being easily extracted. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other similar methods in terms of generated image quality, operation speed, and target recognition network accuracy.},

abstract={An increasing number of security incidents on industrial control systems drew a lot of concerns lately. Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.},

pages={45961-45977},
abstract={Highly efficient languages, such as C/C++, have low-level control over memory. Due to the lack of validity detection for pointers and garbage collection for memory, developers are responsible for dynamic memory management by explicitly allocating and deallocating memory. However, explicit memory management brings a large number of memory safety-related vulnerabilities, such as use-after-free. The threat of use-after-free vulnerabilities has become more and more serious due to their high level of the severity and quick emergence of the number. In this paper, a dynamic defense system is proposed against use-after-free exploits by introducing an approach based on multi-level pointers that insert intermediate pointers between a heap object and its related pointers. First, the relationship between a heap object to be protected, and the related pointers pointing to it, is established by combing with intermediate pointers. Then, all of the accesses to this object via its related pointers can only be achieved through these intermediate pointers. Finally, to prevent the dangling pointers from being dereferenced to this object, all the intermediate pointers related to this object are invalidated when it is freed so that any access to a freed object can be prevented due to the invalidated intermediate pointers. The prototype system MPChecker is implemented, which can prevent use-after-free exploits for C/C++ multi-threaded programs. Compared with the related methods, MPChecker can protect pointers that are copied in a type-unsafe way from being de-referenced to freed objects. In addition, it can also defend against dangling pointers located on the whole memory, including the stack, the heap, and global memory, rather than the heap only. The defense capability is proved by protecting against two exploits to a real-world program, comparing the support of type-unsafe copy with a self-written program. The performance evaluation of MPChecker with some benchmarks, multi-threaded programs, and real-world programs, shows its comparable efficiency.},

abstract={Phasor measurement unit (PMU) data manipulation attacks (PDMAs) may blind the control centers to the real-time operating conditions of power systems. Detecting these attacks accurately is essential to ensure the normal operation of power system monitoring and control. Using long-term accumulated historical PMU measurements to train a machine learning model to detect PDMAs has shown promising results. In this paper, deepautoencoder-based anomaly measurers are deployed throughout the power system to build a distributed PDMA detection framework. The architecture of a deep autoencoder and its training process are introduced. How to convert the historical PMU measurements into data samples for learning is also elaborated upon. Once trained, an anomaly measurer can assess the PDMA existence possibility of the new PMU measurements. By integrating the results of different anomaly measurers, the proposed distributed PDMA detection framework can detect PDMAs in the whole power system. The effectiveness and detection performance of the framework are discussed through experiments.},

abstract={Intrusion Detection systems are important tools in preventing malicious traffic from penetrating into networks and systems. Recently, Intrusion Detection Systems are rapidly enhancing their detection capabilities using machine learning algorithms. However, these algorithms are vulnerable to new unknown types of attacks that can evade machine learning IDS. In particular, they may be vulnerable to attacks based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). GANs have been widely used in domains such as image processing, natural language processing to generate adversarial data of different types such as graphics, videos, texts, etc. We propose a model using GAN to generate adversarial DDoS attacks that can change the attack profile and can be undetected. Our simulation results indicate that by continuous changing of attack profile, defensive systems that use incremental learning will still be vulnerable to new attacks.},

abstract={The application of network technology and high-tech equipment in power systems has increased the degree of grid intelligence, and malicious attacks on smart grids have also increased year by year. The wrong data injection attack launched by the attacker will destroy the integrity of the data by changing the data of the sensor and controller, which will lead to the wrong decision of the control system and even paralyze the power transmission network. This paper uses the measured values of smart grid sensors as samples, analyzes the attack vectors maliciously injected by attackers and the statistical characteristics of system data, and proposes a false data injection attack detection strategy. It is considered that the measured values of sensors have spatial distribution characteristics, the Gaussian mixture model of grid node feature vectors is obtained by training sample values, the test measurement values are input into the Gaussian mixture model, and the knowledge of clustering is used to detect whether the power grid is malicious data attacks. The power supplies of IEEE-18 and IEEE-30 simulation systems was tested, and the influence of the system statistical measurement characteristics on the detection accuracy was analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy has better detection performance than the support vector machine method.},

abstract={Nowadays, autonomous driving has attracted much attention from both industry and academia. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a key component in autonomous driving, which is also increasingly adopted in pervasive computing such as smartphones, wearable devices, and IoT networks. Prior work shows CNN-based classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, it is uncertain to what extent regression models such as driving models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the effectiveness of existing defense techniques, and the defense implications for system and middleware builders.This paper presents an in-depth analysis of five adversarial attacks and four defense methods on three driving models. Experiments show that, similar to classification models, these models are still highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This poses a big security threat to autonomous driving and thus should be taken into account in practice. While these defense methods can effectively defend against different attacks, none of them are able to provide adequate protection against all five attacks. We derive several implications for system and middleware builders: (1) when adding a defense component against adversarial attacks, it is important to deploy multiple defense methods in tandem to achieve a good coverage of various attacks, (2) a black-box attack is much less effective compared with a white-box attack, implying that it is important to keep model details (e.g., model architecture, hyperparameters) confidential via model obfuscation, and (3) driving models with a complex architecture are preferred if computing resources permit as they are more resilient to adversarial attacks than simple models.},

abstract={We show that end-to-end learning of communication systems through deep neural network autoencoders can be extremely vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. Specifically, we elaborate how an attacker can craft effective physical black-box adversarial attacks.

We reveal that the adversarial attacks are more destructive than the jamming attacks. We also show that classical coding schemes are more robust than the autoencoders against both adversarial and jamming attacks.},

It also takes the secondary consequences of attacks on CPSs into consideration. The intrusion process of attackers has been modeled using attack graph and the consequence estimation process of the attack has been investigated using process model. The security attributes and the special parameters involved in the security analysis of CPSs, have been identified and considered. The quantitative evaluation has been done using the probability of attacks, time-to-shutdown of the system and security risks.

abstract={Deepfake image manipulation has become a serious security threat to the social network. Currently, there are limited studies on protective methods that are against Deepfake image manipulation. To tackle this problem, we here propose an adversary attack based smart watermark model, which adds unperceptive watermarks to images so that the images become adversary examples to Deepfake models. When the Deepfake manipulates these watermarked images, the manipulated images become blur. The manipulation thus can be easily recognized by human and machines. Our experiments have shown that our model outperforms the SOTA and can be used to effectively prevent Deepfake manipulation.},

abstract={Object detection is one of the important tasks in many computer vision applications. Especially, in vision-guided robotics, numerous pattern matching algorithms are used for detecting and localizing randomly oriented objects in pick-and-place systems. Feature matching algorithms such as SIFT, SURF etc. are widely employed where geometric pattern matching algorithms often fail when objects lack contours and edges. Even though these algorithms give reliable results under extreme conditions of scene clutter and occlusion, they usually fail when there are multiple instances of same object and object shape deformation problems in the scene. In this paper, we present an approach which uses SURF feature sets consisting of local neighbor features for matching and hierarchical clustering for estimating object center. Using extracted local neighbor features and their descriptors, our algorithm finds more number of true-positive matches among features and improves the detection in the case of deformation and multiple instances. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

False data is a special type of data injection designed to evade typical bad data detection schemes and compromise state estimates, possibly leading to improper control of the grid. Topology perturbation is a situational awareness method that implements the use of distributed flexible AC transmission system devices to alter impedance on optimally chosen lines, updating the grid topology and exposing the presence of false data. The success of the topology perturbation for improving grid control and exposing false data in AC state estimation is demonstrated. A technique is developed for identifying the false data injection attack vector and quantifying the compromised measurements. The proposed method provides successful false data detection and identification in IEEE 14, 24, and 39-bus test systems using AC state estimation.},

However, the privacy and security issues of DL have been revealed that the DL model can be stolen or reverse engineered, sensitive training data can be inferred, even a recognizable face image of the victim can be recovered. Besides, the recent works have found that the DL model is vulnerable to adversarial examples perturbed by imperceptible noised, which can lead the DL model to predict wrongly with high confidence. In this paper, we first briefly introduces the four types of attacks and privacy-preserving techniques in DL. We then review and summarize the attack and defense methods associated with DL privacy and security in recent years. To demonstrate that security threats really exist in the real world, we also reviewed the adversarial attacks under the physical condition. Finally, we discuss current challenges and open problems regarding privacy and security issues in DL.},

First, we introduce a novel deep network architecture using a hierarchical attention autoencoder (HAAE) to compute temporal content hashes (TCHs) from minutes or hour-long audio-visual streams. Our TCHs are sensitive to accidental or malicious content modification (tampering). The focus of our self-supervised HAAE is to guard against content modification such as frame truncation or corruption but ensure invariance against format shift (i.e. codec change). This is necessary due to the curatorial requirement for archives to format shift video over time to ensure future accessibility. Second, we describe how the TCHs (and the models used to derive them) are secured via a proof-of-authority blockchain distributed across multiple independent archives. We report on the efficacy of ARCHANGEL within the context of a trial deployment in which the national government archives of the United Kingdom, United States of America, Estonia, Australia and Norway participated.},

abstract={Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which can fool classifiers by adding small perturbations onto the original image. Since the pioneering optimization-based adversarial attack method, many following methods have been proposed in the past several years. However most of these methods add perturbations in a "pixel-wise" and "global" way. Firstly, because of the contradiction between the local smoothness of natural images and the noisy property of these adversarial perturbations, this "pixel-wise" way makes these methods not robust to image processing based defense methods and steganalysis based detection methods. Secondly, we find adding perturbations to the background is less useful than to the salient object, thus the "global" way is also not optimal. Based on these two considerations, we propose the first robust superpixel-guided attentional adversarial attack method. Specifically, the adversarial perturbations are only added to the salient regions and guaranteed to be same within each superpixel. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method can preserve the attack ability even in this highly constrained modification space. More importantly, compared to existing methods, it is significantly more robust to image processing based defense and steganalysis based detection.},

abstract={As the size and complexity of high performance computing (HPC) systems grow in line with advancements in hardware and software technology, HPC systems increasingly suffer from performance variations due to shared resource contention as well as software- and hardware-related problems. Such performance variations can lead to failures and inefficiencies, which impact the cost and resilience of HPC systems. To minimize the impact of performance variations, one must quickly and accurately detect and diagnose the anomalies that cause the variations and take mitigating actions. However, it is difficult to identify anomalies based on the voluminous, high-dimensional, and noisy data collected by system monitoring infrastructures. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to automatically diagnose performance anomalies at runtime. Our framework leverages historical resource usage data to extract signatures of previously-observed anomalies. We first convert collected time series data into easy-to-compute statistical features. We then identify the features that are required to detect anomalies, and extract the signatures of these anomalies. At runtime, we use these signatures to diagnose anomalies with negligible overhead. We evaluate our framework using experiments on a real-world HPC supercomputer and demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies 98 percent of injected anomalies and consistently outperforms existing anomaly diagnosis techniques.},

abstract={Smart Grid Monitoring System(SGMS) is an important means to protect the security of smart grid. The high volumes of alerts generated by SGMS often confuse managers. Automatically handling alerts and extracting attack events is a critical issue for smart grid. Most of the existing security event analysis methods are designed for Internet, which will not be directly applicable to the power grid for high reliability and low attack tolerance requirements. In this paper, a multi-step attack detection model based on alerts of SGMS is proposed. In this model, an alert graph is constructed by IP correlation, and then transformed into candidate attack chains after being aggregated. Consequently, the candidate preliminary attack chains are pruned and denoised by negative causal correlation and non-cascading events. Finally, attack chains and visual attack graphs are formed. Our proposal model needs a little of priori knowledge while automatically extracting multi-step attack events and demonstrating the trajectories among IPs. The experimental results show the model performs well on China Grid data and DARPA 2000 data set.},

abstract={Modern power systems depend on cyber-physical systems to link physical devices and control technologies. A major concern in the implementation of smart power networks is to minimize the risk of data privacy violation (e.g., by adversaries using data poisoning and inference attacks). In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving framework to achieve both privacy and security in smart power networks. The framework includes two main modules: a two-level privacy module and an anomaly detection module. In the two-level privacy module, an enhanced-proof-of-work-technique-based blockchain is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks, and a variational autoencoder is simultaneously applied for transforming data into an encoded format for preventing inference attacks. In the anomaly detection module, a long short-term memory deep learning technique is used for training and validating the outputs of the two-level privacy module using two public datasets. The results highlight that the proposed framework can efficiently protect data of smart power networks and discover abnormal behaviors, in comparison to several state-of-the-art techniques.},

They aim to identify homogenous groups of applications exhibiting similar behavior and allow to handle a proportion of contaminating data to guarantee the robustness of clustering. Then, a clustering-based detection technique is applied to compute an anomaly score for each application, leading to discover the most dangerous among them. Initial experiments results prove the efficiency and the accuracy of the used clustering methods in detecting abnormal smartphone's applications and that with a low false alerts rate.},

abstract={While data poisoning attacks on classifiers were originally proposed to degrade a classifier's usability, there has been strong recent interest in backdoor data poisoning attacks, where the classifier learns to classify to a target class whenever a backdoor pattern (e.g., a watermark or innocuous pattern) is added to an example from some class other than the target class. In this paper, we conduct a benchmark experimental study to assess the effectiveness of backdoor attacks against deep neural network (DNN) classifiers for images (CIFAR-10 domain), as well as of anomaly detection defenses against these attacks, assuming the defender has access to the (poisoned) training set. We also propose a novel defense scheme (cluster impurity (CI)) based on two ideas: i) backdoor patterns may cluster in a DNN's (e.g. penultimate) deep layer latent space; ii) image filtering (or additive noise) may remove the backdoor patterns, and thus alter the class decision produced by the DNN. We demonstrate that largely imperceptible single-pixel backdoor attacks are highly successful, with no effect on classifier usability. However, the CI approach is highly effective at detecting these attacks, and more successful than previous backdoor detection methods.},

abstract={Collaborative filtering is widely used at online vendors and review sites in order to recommend items based on the ratings of many users. However, there are several problems with this method, and one of them is the existence of attacks that intend to distort the predicted ratings of specific items. This paper proposes a collaborative filtering method that reduces the impact of attacks while maintaining or improving the prediction accuracy by applying clustering to the target data multiple times and predicting the ratings for unrated items inside each cluster. In addition, the usefulness of the method is investigated using an evaluation method that measures the error between actual user ratings and predicted ratings. Furthermore, the robustness against attacks is investigated by comparing the prediction errors before and after attacks.},

abstract={The dependence on advanced information and communication technology increases the vulnerability in smart grids under cyber-attacks. Recent research on unobservable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) reveals the high risk of secure system operation, since these attacks can bypass current bad data detection mechanisms. To mitigate this risk, this paper proposes a data-driven learning-based algorithm for detecting unobservable FDIAs in distribution systems. We use autoencoders for efficient dimension reduction and feature extraction of measurement datasets. Further, we integrate the autoencoders into an advanced generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which successfully detects anomalies under FDIAs by capturing the unconformity between abnormal and secure measurements. Also, considering that the datasets collected from practical power systems are partially labeled due to expensive labeling costs and missing labels, the proposed method only requires a few labeled measurement data in addition to unlabeled data for training. Numerical simulations in three-phase unbalanced IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus distribution systems validate the detection accuracy and efficiency of this method.},

In this paper, we propose an accurate signature generation system for zero-day polymorphic worms. We have designed a novel Double-honeynet system, which is able to detect zero-day polymorphic worms that have not been seen before. To generate signatures for polymorphic worms we have two steps. The first step is the polymorphic worms sample collection which is done by the Double-honeynet system. The second step is the signature generation for the collected samples which is done by k-means clustering algorithm and a Multilayer Perceptron Model. The system collects different types of polymorphic worms, we used the k-means clustering algorithm to separate each type into a cluster. The Multilayer Perceptron Model is used to generate signatures for each cluster. The main goal for this system is to reduce the false positives and false negatives.},

abstract={In recent years, the proliferation of so-called “fake news” has caused much disruptions in society and weakened the news ecosystem. Therefore, to mitigate such problems, researchers have developed state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to autodetect fake news on social media using sophisticated data science and machine learning techniques. In this work, then, we ask “what if adversaries attempt to attack such detection models?” and investigate related issues by (i) proposing a novel attack scenario against fake news detectors, in which adversaries can post malicious comments toward news articles to mislead SOTA fake news detectors, and (ii) developing Malcom, an end-to-end adversarial comment generation framework to achieve such an attack. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that about 94% and 93.5% of the time on average Malcom can successfully mislead five of the latest neural detection models to always output targeted real and fake news labels. Furthermore, Malcom can also fool black box fake news detectors to always output real news labels 90% of the time on average. We also compare our attack model with four baselines across two real-world datasets, not only on attack performance but also on generated quality, coherency, transferability, and robustness. We release the source code of Malcom at https://github.com/lethaiq/MALCOM1.},

abstract={Most existing industrial control systems (ICSs), such as building energy management systems (EMSs), were installed when potential security threats were only physical. With advances in connectivity, ICSs are now, typically, connected to communications networks and, as a result, can be accessed remotely. This extends the attack surface to include the potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage, safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a novel cyber-physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a reliable estimation-based attack-resilient control policy, whenever an attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real EMS site and simulated attacks.},

To cope with cyber-attacks, this paper reaches beyond the traditional one-side security defense systems and proposes the concept of cyber-physical coordinated situation awareness and active defense to improve the ability of CPPSs. An example of a regional frequency control system is used to show the validness and potential of this concept. Then, the research framework is presented for studying and implementing this concept.

abstract={The Automation industries that uses Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are highly vulnerable for Network threats. Systems that are air-gapped and isolated from the internet are highly affected due to insider attacks like Spoofing, DOS and Malware threats that affects confidentiality, integrity and availability of Operational Technology (OT) system elements and degrade its performance even though security measures are taken. In this paper, a behavior-based intrusion prevention system (IPS) is designed for OT networks. The proposed system is implemented on SCADA test bed with two systems replicates automation scenarios in industry. This paper describes 4 main classes of cyber-attacks with their subclasses against SCADA systems and methodology with design of components of IPS system, database creation, Baselines and deployment of system in environment. IPS system identifies not only IT protocols but also Industry Control System (ICS) protocols Modbus and DNP3 with their inside communication fields using deep packet inspection (DPI). The analytical results show 99.89% accuracy on binary classification and 97.95% accuracy on multiclass classification of different attack vectors performed on network with low false positive rate. These results are also validated by actual deployment of IPS in SCADA systems with the prevention of DOS attack.},

abstract={Due to the aging of electric infrastructures, conventional power grid is being modernized toward smart grid that enables two-way communications between consumer and utility, and thus more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. However, due to the attacking cost, the attack strategy may vary a lot from one operation scenario to another from the perspective of adversary, which is not considered in previous studies. Therefore, in this paper, scenario-based two-stage sparse cyber-attack models for smart grid with complete and incomplete network information are proposed. Then, in order to effectively detect the established cyber-attacks, an interval state estimation-based defense mechanism is developed innovatively. In this mechanism, the lower and upper bounds of each state variable are modeled as a dual optimization problem that aims to maximize the variation intervals of the system variable. At last, a typical deep learning, i.e., stacked auto-encoder, is designed to properly extract the nonlinear and nonstationary features in electric load data. These features are then applied to improve the accuracy for electric load forecasting, resulting in a more narrow width of state variables. The uncertainty with respect to forecasting errors is modeled as a parametric Gaussian distribution. The validation of the proposed cyber-attack models and defense mechanism have been demonstrated via comprehensive tests on various IEEE benchmarks.},

abstract={Designing secure systems is a complex task, particularly for designers who are no security experts. Cyber security plays a key role in embedded systems, especially for the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT systems of this kind are becoming increasingly important in daily life as they simplify various tasks. They are usually small, either embedded into bigger systems or battery driven, and perform monitoring or one shot tasks. Thus, they are subject to manifold constraints in terms of performance, power consumption, chip area, etc. As they are continuously connected to the internet and utilize our private data to perform their tasks, they are interesting for potential attackers. Cyber security thus plays an important role for the design of an IoT system. As the usage of security measures usually increases both computation time, as well as power consumption, a conflict between these constraints must be solved. For the designers of such systems, balancing these constraints constitutes a highly complex task. In this paper we propose a novel approach for considering possible security attacks on embedded systems, simplifying the consideration of security requirements immediately at the start of the design process. We introduce a security aware design space exploration framework which based on an architectural, behavioral and security attack description, finds the optimal design for IoT systems. We also demonstrate the feasibility and the benefits of our framework based on a door access system use case.},

abstract={The success of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in security applications, such as malware detection, is highly criticized for their vulnerability to Adversarial Examples (AE): perturbed input samples (e.g. malware) can mislead ML to produce an adversary's desired output (e.g. benign class label). AEs against ML models are broadly studied in the computer vision domain where the adversary perturbs the pixel values of an image such that the change is not perceptible, but the resulting image is misclassified by the model. We investigate the effectiveness of attack techniques proposed in the image domain to attack ML classifiers in the context of mobile malware detection. Since the feature vector representation of samples is often used in ML, a simplified evaluation of ML classifiers' robustness to AEs is to study feature-based attack models, where the adversary perturbs the input features. We compare the methods, trade-offs, and gaps for such attack models and show that generative models (e.g. GANs) outperform a selection of existing attacks in terms of attack success rate but apply large distortion to the original sample. We also describe how we use the generated samples for increasing a classifier's robustness through adversarial training.},

abstract={Recently, different machine learning-based detection systems are proposed to detect DDoS saturation attacks in Software-defined Networking (SDN). Meanwhile, different research studies highlight the vulnerabilities of adapting such systems in SDN. For instance, an adversary can fool the machine learning classifiers of these systems by crafting specific adversarial attack samples, preventing the detection of DoS saturation attacks. To better understand the security properties of these classifiers in adversarial settings, this paper investigates the robustness of the supervised and unsupervised machine learning classifiers against adversarial attacks. First, we propose an adversarial testing tool that can generate adversarial attacks that avoid the detection of four saturation attacks (i.e., SYN, UDP, ICMP, and TCP-SARFU), by perturbing different traffic features. Second, we propose a machine learning-based saturation attack detection system that utilizes different supervised and unsupervised machine learning classifiers as a testing platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the generated adversarial attacks can reduce the detection performance of the proposed detection system dramatically. Specifically, the detection performance of the four saturation attacks was decreased by more than 90% across several machine learning classifiers. This indicates that the proposed adversarial testing tool can effectively compromise the machine learning-based saturation attack detection systems.},

To reduce traffic congestion and traveling time, a number of real-time route guidance schemes have been developed to assist travelers in determining the optimal route for their transit. In this paper, we address the vulnerability issue of the route guiding process and study data integrity attacks against route guidance schemes. To be specific, we consider a generic attack, in which the adversary may compromise vehicles via wireless communication networks and then manipulate the real-time traffic information generated or forwarded by these vehicles, and finally broadcast the forged real-time traffic information into vehicular networks. We formally model the attack and quantitatively analyze its impact on the effectiveness of route guidance schemes. Our findings show that the investigated data integrity attack can effectively disrupt route guidance, resulting in significant traffic congestion, the increase of travel time, and the imbalanced use of transportation resources.},

abstract={The man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack is a cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts traffic, thus harming the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network. It remains a popular attack vector due to its simplicity. However, existing solutions are either not portable, suffer from a high false positive rate, or simply not generic. In this paper, we propose Vesper: a novel plug-and-play MitM detector for local area networks. Vesper uses a technique inspired from impulse response analysis used in the domain of acoustic signal processing. Analogous to how echoes in a cave capture the shape and construction of the environment, so to can a short and intense pulse of ICMP echo requests model the link between two network hosts. Vesper uses neural networks called autoencoders to model the normal patterns of the echoed pulses and detect when the environment changes. Using this technique, Vesper is able to detect MitM attacks with high accuracy while incurring minimal network overhead. We evaluate Vesper on LANs consisting of video surveillance cameras, servers, and PC workstations. We also investigate several possible adversarial attacks against Vesper and demonstrate how Vesper mitigates these attacks.},

abstract={In big data era, machine learning is one of fundamental techniques in intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Poisoning attack, which is one of the most recognized security threats towards machine learning- based IDSs, injects some adversarial samples into the training phase, inducing data drifting of training data and a significant performance decrease of target IDSs over testing data. In this paper, we adopt the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel poisoning method that attack against several machine learning algorithms used in IDSs. Specifically, we propose a boundary pattern detection algorithm to efficiently generate the points that are near to abnormal data but considered to be normal ones by current classifiers. Then, we introduce a Batch-EPD Boundary Pattern (BEBP) detection algorithm to overcome the limitation of the number of edge pattern points generated by EPD and to obtain more useful adversarial samples. Based on BEBP, we further present a moderate but effective poisoning method called chronic poisoning attack. Extensive experiments on synthetic and three real network data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed poisoning method against several well-known machine learning algorithms and a practical intrusion detection method named FMIFS-LSSVM-IDS.},

abstract={The World Wide Web evolved so rapidly that it is no longer considered a luxury, but a necessity. That is why currently the most popular infection vectors used by cyber criminals are either web pages or commonly used documents (such as pdf files). In both of these cases, the malicious actions performed are written in Java Script. Because of this, Java Script has become the preferred language for spreading malware. In order to be able to stop malicious content from executing, detection of its infection vector is crucial. In this paper we propose various methods for detecting Java Script-based attack vectors. For achieving our goal we first need to fight metamorphism techniques usually used in Java Script malicious code, which are by no means trivial: garbage instruction insertion, variable renaming, equivalent instruction substitution, function permutation, instruction reordering, and so on. Our approach to deal with metamorphism starts with splitting the Java Script content in components and filtering the insignificant ones. We then use a data set, consisting in over one million Java Script files in order to test several machine learning algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models, linear classifiers and hybrid approaches for malware detection. Finally, we analyze these detection methods from a practical point of view, emphasizing the need for a very low false positive rate and the ability to be trained on large datasets.},

abstract={With machine learning (ML) services now used in a number of mission-critical human-facing domains, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of ML models becomes all important. In this work, we consider the paradigm where cloud service providers collect big data from resource-constrained devices for building ML-based prediction models that are then sent back to be run locally on the intermittently connected resource-constrained devices. Our proposed solution comprises an intelligent polynomial-time heuristic that maximizes the level of trust of ML models by selecting and switching between a subset of the ML models from a superset of models in order to maximize the trustworthiness while respecting the given reconfiguration budget/rate and reducing the cloud communication overhead. We evaluate the performance of our proposed heuristic using two case studies. First, we consider Industrial IoT (IIoT) services, and as a proxy for this setting, we use the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set to predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our results in this setting show that the trust level of the selected models is 0.49%-3.17% less compared to the results obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Second, we consider smart cities services, and as a proxy of this setting, we use an experimental transportation data set to predict the number of cars. Our results show that the selected model's trust level is 0.7%-2.53% less compared to the results obtained using ILP. We also show that our proposed heuristic achieves an optimal competitive ratio in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem.},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks are highly vulnerable to attacks due to infrastructure less environment. The features of MANETs are like open media, dynamic changes in topology, cooperative and collaborative algorithm and no centralized monitoring system. These features make the network more prone to malicious attack. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster. Periodically the cluster head updation is done according to three parameters. We have implemented our algorithm using the NS simulator. The performance of the proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has also been evaluated in the process. The performance graph shows marked improvement as far as packet dropping is concerned.},

Very often, the supervised learning and rules based approach like SNORT fetch problem to identify new type of attacks. In this implementation, the input samples are numerical encoded and applied un-supervised deep learning techniques called Auto Encoder (AE) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

abstract={The significant dependence on cyberspace has indeed brought new risks that often compromise, exploit and damage invaluable data and systems. Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.},

abstract={Analyzing network vulnerability, especially connectivity vulnerability, is vital for network security planning. Traditionally, network vulnerability analysis methods separate the studies of global connectivity vulnerability and critical area vulnerability, and thus ignore joint failure of network connectivity and critical-area integrity that may cause grave damage to a network. To this end, this paper proposes a prioritizing critical area approach for connectivity analysis to identify the corresponding vulnerable elements. Specifically, we consider the worst-case scenario of a network and aim at finding the minimum disruption-cost set of elements whose removal not only severely damages network connectivity but also disrupts the critical-area integrity. Since the above optimization problem is NP-hard, a heuristic algorithm based on spectral partitioning is developed to solve it. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in accurately identifying the vulnerable elements in critical areas to prevent significant loss in the overall network connectivity and performance.},

abstract={With wide deployment of machine learning (ML)-based systems for a variety of applications including medical, military, automotive, genomic, multimedia, and social networking, there is great potential for damage from adversarial learning (AL) attacks. In this article, we provide a contemporary survey of AL, focused particularly on defenses against attacks on deep neural network classifiers. After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), backdoor DP, and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against the same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis. We also consider several scenarios for detecting backdoors. We provide a technical assessment for reviewed works, including identifying any issues/limitations, required hyperparameters, needed computational complexity, as well as the performance measures evaluated and the obtained quality. We then delve deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; small perturbations for TTE attacks: a fallacy or a requirement; validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; black, gray, or white-box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; and susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images. The article concludes with a discussion of continuing research directions, including the supreme challenge of detecting attacks whose goal is not to alter classification decisions, but rather simply to embed, without detection, “fake news” or other false content.},

abstract={Machine learning has been pervasively used in a wide range of applications due to its technical breakthroughs in recent years. It has demonstrated significant success in dealing with various complex problems, and shows capabilities close to humans or even beyond humans. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to various attacks, which will compromise the security of the models themselves and the application systems. Moreover, such attacks are stealthy due to the unexplained nature of the deep learning models. In this survey, we systematically analyze the security issues of machine learning, focusing on existing attacks on machine learning systems, corresponding defenses or secure learning techniques, and security evaluation methods. Instead of focusing on one stage or one type of attack, this paper covers all the aspects of machine learning security from the training phase to the test phase. First, the machine learning model in the presence of adversaries is presented, and the reasons why machine learning can be attacked are analyzed. Then, the machine learning security-related issues are classified into five categories: training set poisoning; backdoors in the training set; adversarial example attacks; model theft; recovery of sensitive training data. The threat models, attack approaches, and defense techniques are analyzed systematically. To demonstrate that these threats are real concerns in the physical world, we also reviewed the attacks in real-world conditions. Several suggestions on security evaluations of machine learning systems are also provided. Last, future directions for machine learning security are also presented.},

abstract={Automatic harvesting is an important part of agricultural automation. Navigation path points extraction is a prerequisite of automatic harvesting for combine harvester. The traditional methods of navigation path extraction in the farmland are mainly based on color space. The color space can be heavily influenced by environmental factors, such as illumination, weeds, shadows and crop types. On the contrary, depth information can be less affected by these factors. This paper proposes one method about navigation path points extraction based on both color space and depth information, which can improve robustness and accuracy of the navigation path points extraction. The method is mainly composed of three parts: navigation path points extraction based on color space, navigation path points extraction based on depth information and navigation path points fusion. The farmland experiments show that an average accuracy of navigation path points extraction is 98.02% with average pixel error of 4.08, average relative error of 0.64% and average distance error of 3.3cm. The experiment results show that this paper proposes one effective navigation path points method.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel ontological model of Cyber Influence Campaigns (CICs). The model accepts both physical and cyber based actions. The model represents the mechanics, linkages, and structure of tailored data to concurrently analyse both the physical and cyber realms. Influence modeling and ontological based analysis of social media has to date mainly focused on the use of ontologies to categorise or cluster the results of text based feature extraction. Whilst this is highly important for detection of misinformation that has the potential to influence a network, these methods do not provide a mechanism for mapping events across realms in order to quantify the influence in meaningful ways. By developing a novel semantic model and unique classes that leverage the graph nature of the ontological representation, our ontological model provides causal linkages and a framework which is applicable for analysis and deeper insights into CICs. This study also builds two tailored datasets for our ontological model from raw Twitter data as the IEEE DataPort Cyber Influence Campaign Ontology dataset (DOI 10.21227/70kc-yx38) and details how to analyze various CIC scenarios.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to network attacks because communication relies on the network that links the various components in the CPS. The importance of network security is self-evident. In this study, we conduct a network security risk assessment from the perspectives of the host and the network, and we propose a new framework for a multidimensional network security risk assessment that includes two stages, i.e., risk identification and risk calculation. For the risk identification stage, we propose a multidimensional hierarchical index system for assessing cybersecurity risk; the system's security status is determined in three dimensions, i.e., basic operation, vulnerabilities, and threats, and these dimensions guide the data collection. In the risk calculation stage, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to assess the network security risk. We provide a new definition of the quality of alert and optimize the observation sequence of the HMM. The model uses a learning algorithm instead of setting the parameters manually. We introduce the concept of network node association to increase the reliability and accuracy of the risk assessment. The simulation results show that the proposed index system provides quantitative data that reflect the security status of the network. The proposed network security risk assessment method based on the improved HMM (I-HMM) reflects the security risk status in a timely and intuitive manner and detects the degree of risk that different hosts pose to the network.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of human detection in crowded scenes is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem, in which, given a set of candidates, predefined 3-D human shape models are matched with image evidence, provided by foreground extraction and probability of boundary, to estimate the human configuration. The optimal solution is obtained by decomposing the mutually related candidates into unoccluded and occluded ones in each iteration according to a graph description of the candidate relations and then only matching models for the unoccluded candidates. A candidate validation and rejection process based on minimum description length and local occlusion reasoning is carried out after each iteration of model matching. The advantage of the proposed optimization procedure is that its computational cost is much smaller than that of global optimization methods, while its performance is comparable to them. The proposed method achieves a detection rate of about 2% higher on a subset of images of the Caviar data set than the best result reported by previous works. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using another challenging data set.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the emerging security threats at Near-Threshold Computing (NTC) that are poised to jeopardize the trustworthy operation of future low-power electronic devices. A substantial research effort over the last decade has bolstered energy efficient operation in low-power computing. However, innovation in low-power security has received only marginal attention, thwarting a ubiquitous adoption of critical Internet of Things applications, such as wearable gadgets. Using a cross-layer methodology, we demonstrate that the timing fault vulnerability of a circuit rapidly increases as the operating conditions of the transistor devices shift from super-threshold to near-threshold values. Exploiting this vulnerability, we propose a novel threat model for NTC, referred to as a Timing Fault Attack atNTC (TITAN). TITAN relies on a malicious application software to induce timing fault attacks in the underlying NTC hardware. We evaluate the efficacy of TITAN using real hardware. Additionally, we propose two security parameters that dictate the fault resilience of a system. Based on those parameters, we show a 1.6× and a 2.8× deterioration in the fault resilience of a low-power operation, over a traditional super-threshold operation. Using a GDB driven analysis, we also present different user-level impacts of TITAN, on some real-life applications.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) is an emerging application for industrial automation. It is being widely used in critical infrastructure for monitoring and controlling the activities. The collaborative environment and interconnectivity of SCADA system needs communications and transmission of sensed real time data like status of machines, breaks and leakages in the system across various devices in the industrial plant. Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture. This work also considers the constraints of the SCADA system thereby providing an elegant identification of malicious activities for the current SCADA system.},

abstract={The adversarial attack methods based on gradient information can adequately find the perturbations, that is, the combinations of rewired links, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the deep learning model-based graph embedding algorithms, but it is also easy to fall into a local optimum. Therefore, this article proposes a momentum gradient attack (MGA) against the graph convolutional network (GCN) model, which can achieve more aggressive attacks with fewer rewiring links. Compared with directly updating the original network using gradient information, integrating the momentum term into the iterative process can stabilize the updating direction, which makes the model jump out of poor local optimum and enhances the method with stronger transferability. Experiments on node classification and community detection methods based on three well-known network embedding algorithms show that MGA has a better attack effect and transferability.},

abstract={Real-time route guidance schemes, as one of the critical services in Transportation-based Cyber-Physical Systems, have been introduced to assist travelers in determining optimal routing with low traffic congestion and travel time. To secure the route guidance process, which enables traffic efficiency and safety, in this paper we first investigate security issues of route guidance schemes via modeling and analysis of data integrity attacks on the route guidance process, and then develop corresponding mitigation mechanisms to combat the investigated attack. Via the manipulation of traffic state data measured or generated by compromised vehicles, the data integrity attack can give rise to erroneous predictions of traffic states and induce improper determination of guided routes for vehicles, increasing traffic congestion, and reducing traffic efficiency and safety. We formally model the attack and analyze its impacts on the effectiveness of route guidance schemes. Our results show that the data integrity attack can effectively disrupt route guidance schemes, leading to significant traffic congestion, increased traveling time, and imbalanced use of transportation resources. To mitigate the data integrity attack, we investigate the forged data filtering scheme, in which the forged traffic state data can be filtered out during data delivery in vehicular networks. Extensive performance evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forged data filtering scheme in comparing with an exiting scheme.},

abstract={Buffer overflow attacks still pose a significant threat to the security and availability of today's computer systems. Although there are a number of solutions proposed to provide adequate protection against buffer overflow attacks, most of existing solutions terminate the vulnerable program when the buffer overflow occurs, effectively rendering the program unavailable. The impact on availability is a serious problem on service-oriented platforms. This paper presents SafeStack, a system that can automatically diagnose and patch stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The key technique of our solution is to virtualize memory accesses and move the vulnerable buffer into protected memory regions, which provides a fundamental and effective protection against recurrence of the same attack without stopping normal system execution. We developed a prototype on a Linux system, and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the system using a range of applications. Our experimental results showed that SafeStack can quickly generate runtime patches to successfully handle the attack's recurrence. Furthermore, SafeStack only incurs acceptable overhead for the patched applications.},

abstract={Collaborative deep learning can provide high learning accuracy even participanted users' datasets are small. In the training process, users only share their locally obtained parameters, therefore it is believed that the privacy of users' original datasets can be protected. However, we present an attack approach against users' privacy in collaborative deep learning by utilizing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Membership Inference. In this attack, an attacker builds a discriminator based on users' shared parameters and then trains a GAN network locally. The GAN can refactor the training records of the collaborative deep learning system. According to the generated records, the attacker uses the extent of model overfitting on an input and gets the membership of each group of records by the simplified Membership Inference attack. We evaluate the presented attack model over datasets of complex representations of handwritten digits (MINIST) and face images (CelebA). The results show that an attacker can easily generate the original training sets and classify them to obtain the membership between users' records and their identities in the collaborative deep learning.},

Secondly, a multi-class classifier called HT-SVM (Huffman Tree SVM) is constructed, which could make a faster and more stable classification by making good use of the prior knowledge about distribution of the number of vulnerabilities. Experiments show that the method could obtain higher classification accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract={Recent studies demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which would seriously threaten security-sensitive applications. Existing works synthesized the adversarial examples by perturbing the original/benign images by leveraging the $\mathcal {L}_p$Lp-norm to penalize the perturbations, which restricts the pixel-wise distance between the adversarial images and correspondingly benign images. However, they added perturbations globally to the benign images without explicitly considering their content/spacial structure, resulting in noticeable artifacts especially in those originally clean regions, e.g., sky and smooth surface. In this paper, we propose an invisible adversarial attack, which synthesizes adversarial examples that are visually indistinguishable from benign ones. We adaptively distribute the perturbation according to human sensitivity to a local stimulus in the benign image, i.e., the higher insensitivity, the more perturbation. Two types of adaptive adversarial attacks are proposed: 1) coarse-grained and 2) fine-grained. The former conducts $\mathcal {L}_p$Lp-norm regularized by the novel spatial constraints, which utilizes the rich information of the cluttered regions to mask perturbation. The latter, called Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-based adversarial attack, utilizes the proposed JND$_p$p metric for better measuring the perceptual similarity, and adaptively sets penalty by weighting the pixel-wise perceptual redundancy of an image. We conduct extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and a comprehensive user study with 50 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that JND$_p$p is a better metric for measuring the perceptual similarity than $\mathcal {L}_p$Lp-norm, and the proposed adaptive adversarial attacks can synthesize indistinguishable adversarial examples from benign ones and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Gesture recognition is an important task in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and the research effort towards robust and high-performance recognition algorithms is increasing. In this work, we present a neural network approach for learning an arbitrary number of labeled training gestures to be recognized in real time. The representation of gestures is hand-independent and gestures with both hands are also considered. We use depth information to extract salient motion features and encode gestures as sequences of motion patterns. Preprocessed sequences are then clustered by a hierarchical learning architecture based on self-organizing maps. We present experimental results on two different data sets: command-like gestures for HRI scenarios and communicative gestures that include cultural peculiarities, often excluded in gesture recognition research. For better recognition rates, noisy observations introduced by tracking errors are detected and removed from the training sets. Obtained results motivate further investigation of efficient neural network methodologies for gesture-based communication.},

abstract={With the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, anomalies in network traffic can be detected using machine learning approaches. Before the rise of machine learning, network anomalies which could imply an attack, were detected using well-crafted rules. An attacker who has knowledge in the field of cyber-defence, could make educated guesses to sometimes accurately predict which particular features of network traffic data the cyber-defence mechanism is looking at. With this information, the attacker can circumvent a rulebased cyber-defense system. However, after the advancements of machine learning for network anomaly, it is not easy for a human to understand how to bypass a cyber-defence system. Recently, adversarial attacks have become increasingly common to defeat machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we show that even if we build a classifier and train it with adversarial examples for network data, we can use adversarial attacks and successfully break the system. We propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based algorithm to generate data to train an efficient neural network based classifier, and we subsequently break the system using adversarial attacks.},

abstract={Being the most important critical infrastructure in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), a smart grid exhibits the complicated nature of large scale, distributed, and dynamic environment. Taxonomy of attacks is an effective tool in systematically classifying attacks and it has been placed as a top research topic in CPS by a National Science Foundation (NSG) Workshop. Most existing taxonomy of attacks in CPS are inadequate in addressing the tight coupling of cyber-physical process or/and lack systematical construction. This paper attempts to introduce taxonomy of attacks of agent-based smart grids as an effective tool to provide a structured framework. The proposed idea of introducing the structure of space-time and information flow direction, security feature, and cyber-physical causality is innovative, and it can establish a taxonomy design mechanism that can systematically construct the taxonomy of cyber attacks, which could have a potential impact on the normal operation of the agent-based smart grids. Based on the cyber-physical relationship revealed in the taxonomy, a concrete physical process based cyber attack detection scheme has been proposed. A numerical illustrative example has been provided to validate the proposed physical process based cyber detection scheme.},

Using these heterogeneous data and finding meaningful insights for practical security applications in ICSs is a big challenge. In addition, ICSs have been built for quite a long time. Security has not been seriously taken into account when ICSs were built. Security assessment or attack prevention cannot always be done in real time, as an ICS requires to be online all the time, especially when it comes to systems that affect critical infrastructure.

abstract={Mobile devices are an important part of our everyday lives, and the Android platform has become a market leader. In recent years a number of approaches for Android malware detection have been proposed, using permissions, source code analysis, or dynamic analysis. In this paper, we propose to use a probabilistic discriminative model based on regularized logistic regression for Android malware detection. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that it can generate probabilistic outputs with highly accurate classification results. In particular, we propose to use Android API calls as features extracted from decompiled source code, and analyze and explore issues in feature granularity, feature representation, feature selection, and regularization. We show that the probabilistic discriminative model also works well with permissions, and substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for Android malware detection with application permissions. Furthermore, the discriminative learning model achieves the best detection results by combining both decompiled source code and application permissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that proposes probabilistic discriminative model for Android malware detection with a thorough study of desired representation of decompiled source code and is the first research work for Android malware detection task that combines both analysis of decompiled source code and application permissions.},

abstract={The modern Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home is a challenging environment to secure: devices change, new vulnerabilities are discovered and often remain unpatched, and different users interact with their devices differently and have different cyber risk attitudes. A security breach's impact is not limited to cyberspace, as it can also affect or be facilitated in physical space, for example, via voice. In this environment, intrusion detection cannot rely solely on static models that remain the same over time and are the same for all users. We present MAGPIE, the first smart home intrusion detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home's changing conditions (e.g., new devices, new automation rules and user interaction with them). The method achieves this goal by applying a novel probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism to non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning. MAGPIE rewards the sets of hyperparameters of its underlying isolation forest unsupervised anomaly classifiers based on the cluster silhouette scores of their output. Experimental evaluation in a real household shows that MAGPIE exhibits high accuracy because of two further innovations: it takes into account both cyber and physical sources of data; and it detects human presence to utilise models that exhibit the highest accuracy in each case. MAGPIE is available in open-source format, together with its evaluation datasets, so it can benefit from future advances in unsupervised and reinforcement learning and be able to be enriched with further sources of data as smart home environments and attacks evolve.},

abstract={Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous in online shopping in recent decades due to their power in reducing excessive choices of customers and industries. Recent collaborative filtering methods based on the deep neural network are studied and introduce promising results due to their power in learning hidden representations for users and items. However, it has revealed its vulnerabilities under malicious user attacks. With the knowledge of a collaborative filtering algorithm and its parameters, the performance of this recommendation system can be easily downgraded. Unfortunately, this problem is not addressed well, and the study on defending recommendation systems is insufficient. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of recommendation systems based on two concepts - stage-wise hints training and randomness. To protect a target model, we introduce noise layers in the training of a target model to increase its resistance to adversarial perturbations. To reduce the noise layers' influence on model performance, we introduce intermediate layer outputs as hints from a teacher model to regularize the intermediate layers of a student target model. We consider white box attacks under which attackers have the knowledge of the target model. The generalizability and robustness properties of our method have been analytically inspected in experiments and discussions, and the computational cost is comparable to training a standard neural network-based collaborative filtering model. Through our investigation, the proposed defensive method can reduce the success rate of malicious user attacks and keep the prediction accuracy comparable to standard neural recommendation systems.},

abstract={Securing passwords either written or spoken is considered one of the challenging authentication issues faced by individuals and organizations. Written passwords could be easily stolen by look over, or man-behind, while spoken passwords could be recorded and replayed by attackers. A proposed silent password which is based on a dual security model for lip movement analysis will be a promoting solution to these attacks. The goal of the current research is to propose a hybrid voting framework for silent passwords recognition using lip movement analysis. The proposed framework is built for Arabic language by extracting figures from predefined Arabic lexicon. The predefined lexicon mainly contains the Arabic figures from zero to nine with different shapes. The framework takes a video or sequence of images as an input, and outputs the corresponding silent password for the frames extracted from the input video. In this paper, three techniques will be employed to extract effective visual features from mouth-lip movement. Such techniques are SURF, HoG and Haar feature extractor. The resultant features in each technique are fed separately into a classification model, namely, the hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM identifies corresponding Arabic figure from a predefined lexicon based on input features. The final classification models that are produced from the three techniques have been grouped in a voting scheme to produce the final classification result. The proposed model will be tested on handcrafted data set of lip movement, and it has shown a promising result with improved accuracy of Arabic figures recognition.},

abstract={Stereo cameras are widely used for sensing and navigation of underwater robotic systems. They can provide high resolution color views of a scene; the constrained camera geometry enables metrically accurate depth estimation; they are also relatively cost-effective. Traditional stereo vision algorithms rely on feature detection and matching to enable triangulation of points for estimating disparity. However, for underwater applications, the effects of underwater light propagation lead to image degradation, reducing image quality and contrast. This makes it especially challenging to detect and match features, especially from varying viewpoints. Recently, deep learning has shown success in end-to-end learning of dense disparity maps from stereo images. Still, many state-of-the-art methods are supervised and require ground truth depth or disparity, which is challenging to gather in subsea environments. Simultaneously, deep learning has also been applied to the problem of underwater image restoration. Again, it is difficult or impossible to gather real ground truth data for this problem. In this work, we present an unsupervised deep neural network (DNN) that takes input raw color underwater stereo imagery and outputs dense depth maps and color corrected imagery of underwater scenes. We leverage a model of the process of underwater image formation, image processing techniques, as well as the geometric constraints inherent to the stereo vision problem to develop a modular network that outperforms existing methods.},

abstract={This paper investigates the possible cyber-physical attacks on voltage stability monitoring of a power transmission system. By considering a smart adversary that can launch a vector attack based on power flow equations, conventional voltage stability monitoring systems based on voltage stability indexes will fail to detect the instability issue. This can mislead the Power System Operator (PSO) to take inappropriate corrective action. In order to prevent and to combat such a malicious attack, a new indicator for efficient intrusion detection and a novel mitigation algorithm is proposed. This proposed detection algorithm employs the multi-port equivalent circuit of the power system to calculate the Thevenin Equivalent (TE) parameters. These TE parameters are then used to calculate an indicator, which reveals the attack on Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data. The proposed mitigation scheme then helps PSO to detect which PMU is under-attack. Furthermore, the amount of injected attack vectors is computed or estimated depending on the number of compromised PMUs. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated via illustrative case studies.},

abstract={With the exponential growth of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), new security challenges have emerged. Various vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, and controls have been introduced for the new generation of CPS. However, there lacks a systematic review of the CPS security literature. In particular, the heterogeneity of CPS components and the diversity of CPS systems have made it difficult to study the problem with one generalized model. In this paper, we study and systematize existing research on CPS security under a unified framework. The framework consists of three orthogonal coordinates: 1) from the security perspective, we follow the well-known taxonomy of threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and controls; 2) from the CPS components perspective, we focus on cyber, physical, and cyberphysical components; and 3) from the CPS systems perspective, we explore general CPS features as well as representative systems (e.g., smart grids, medical CPS, and smart cars). The model can be both abstract to show general interactions of components in a CPS application, and specific to capture any details when needed. By doing so, we aim to build a model that is abstract enough to be applicable to various heterogeneous CPS applications; and to gain a modular view of the tightly coupled CPS components. Such abstract decoupling makes it possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight the potential sources of attacks and ways of protection. With this intensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the state-of-the-art on CPS security, provide researchers with a comprehensive list of references, and also encourage the audience to further explore this emerging field.},

abstract={Given a network of who-contacts-whom or who links-to-whom, will a contagious virus/product/meme spread and 'take-over' (cause an epidemic) or die-out quickly? What will change if nodes have partial, temporary or permanent immunity? The epidemic threshold is the minimum level of virulence to prevent a viral contagion from dying out quickly and determining it is a fundamental question in epidemiology and related areas. Most earlier work focuses either on special types of graphs or on specific epidemiological/cascade models. We are the first to show the G2-threshold (twice generalized) theorem, which nicely de-couples the effect of the topology and the virus model. Our result unifies and includes as special case older results and shows that the threshold depends on the first eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix, (a) for any graph and (b) for all propagation models in standard literature (more than 25, including H.I.V.) [20], [12]. Our discovery has broad implications for the vulnerability of real, complex networks, and numerous applications, including viral marketing, blog dynamics, influence propagation, easy answers to 'what-if' questions, and simplified design and evaluation of immunization policies. We also demonstrate our result using extensive simulations on one of the biggest available social contact graphs containing more than 31 million interactions among more than 1 million people representing the city of Portland, Oregon, USA.},

abstract={A mobile ad hoc network or MANET are those wireless networks which posses no infrastructure which are connected by the wireless nodes. And these nodes are generally mobile and the connectionless links are used basically to connect these nodes and these nodes have the capability to self organize and self configure and self arrangement capability. They are not having uniform structure. Because of their mobility and their dynamic nature they are prone to many kinds of malicious attacks by the malicious users because in this every node acts as a sender receiver and the router so no node can be able to understand whether the data has been sent by the malicious sender or the true sender or the receiving node is the true node. Hence by this the data can be lost as well as can be dropped by the malicious user and it can send the fake data to the receiver as well. So there are actually many kinds of attacks at the network layer. MANETS are generally more prone to cyber attacks rather than the wired networks because of their mobile nature. So these attacks like wormhole attacks are a very big issue in the case of networks. As the demand of wireless networks is increasing day by day. So it is a big concern of about how to prevent these kinds of attacks. So that they may not affect the network layer further. So in this paper we are focusing upon these attacks and also about how by using hardware rather than software we can solve the wormhole attacks by using cryptography and the digital signature method.},

abstract={Cloud computing has very attractive features like elastic, on demand and fully managed computer system resources and services. However, due to its distributed and dynamic nature as well as vulnerabilities in virtualization implementation, the cloud environment is prone to various cyber-attacks and security issues related to cloud model. Some of them are inability to access data coming to and from cloud service, theft and misuse of data hosted, no control over sensitive data access, advance threats like malware injection attack, wrapping attacks, virtual machine escape, distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) etc. DDoS is one of the notorious attack. Despite a number of available potential solutions for the detection of DDoS attacks, the increasing frequency and potency of recent attacks and the constantly evolving attack vectors, necessitate the development of improved detection approaches. This article proposes a novel architecture that combines a well posed stacked sparse AutoEncoder (AE) for feature learning with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification of network traffic into benign traffic and DDoS attack traffic. AE and DNN are optimized for detection of DDoS attacks by tuning the parameters using appropriately designed techniques. The improvements suggested in this article lead to low reconstruction error, prevent exploding and vanishing gradients, and lead to smaller network which avoids overfitting. A comparative analysis of the proposed approach with ten state-of-the-art approaches using performance metrics-detection accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, has been conducted. Experiments have been performed on CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD standard datasets for validation. Proposed approach outperforms existing approaches over the NSL-KDD dataset and yields competitive results over the CICIDS2017 dataset.},

abstract={Primary-backup replication enables arbitrary services, which need not be built as deterministic state machines, to be reliable against server crashes. Further, when the primary does not crash, the performance can be close to that of an un-replicated, 1-server system and is arguably far better than what state machine replication can offer. These advantages have made primary-backup replication a widely used technique in commercial provisioning of services, even though the technique assumes that residual software bugs in a server system can lead only to crashes and cannot result in state corruption. This assumption cannot hold against an attacker intent on exploiting vulnerabilities and corrupting the service state when attacks lead to intrusions. This paper presents a system, called FORTRESS, which can encapsulate a primary-backup system and safeguard it from being intruded. At its core, FORTRESS applies proactive obfuscation techniques in a manner appropriate to primary-backup replication and deploys proxy servers for additional defence. Gain in intrusion resilience is shown to be substantial when assessed through analytical evaluations and simulations for a range of attacker scenarios. Further, by implementing two web-based applications, the average performance drop is demonstrated to be in the order of tens of milliseconds even when obfuscation intervals are as small as tens of seconds.},

abstract={Risk managers attempting to reduce cyber-security vulnerability in enterprise IT networks rely on the "malware detection rate" as a primary measure at each layer of protection (e.g., network firewalls, breach detection systems, secure mail-servers, endpoint security suites). However, to be directly usable in risk assessments, separate malware detection rates are required for different malware categories that are quantitatively related to specific impacts of infection. A three-tier hierarchy of malware classification is formulated to assist cyber-risk decision-making. Malware is first categorized by victim impact (e.g., adware, data exfiltration, ransomware); second by malware technique (e.g., malware families), and third by evasion and obfuscation variants within individual malware families (e.g., polymorphs, metamorphs). The three-tier hierarchy is applied to a specific vertical: ransomware (impact); ransomware family (technique); and malware binary variants within one family, WannaCry (obfuscation and evasion).},

abstract={Cognitive radio network (CRN) is the next generation wireless network that allows unlicensed users [secondary users (SUs)] to explore and use the underutilised licensed channels (white spaces) owned by licensed users (primary users). The purpose is to increase the spectrum utilization for enhanced network performance. Clustering segregates SUs in a CRN into logical groups (clusters) with each consisting of a leader (cluster head) and member nodes. A budget-based cluster size adjustment scheme is applied to enable each cluster to adjust its number of member nodes in its cluster based on the availability of white spaces in order to improve network scalability. However, cluster size adjustment is prone to attacks by malicious SUs that launch random and intelligent attacks. Hence, we incorporate an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning (RL) into a trust model to countermeasure the random and intelligent attacks. The simulation results show that RL-based trust model increases the utilization of white spaces and cluster size to improve network scalability and enhance network performance despite the presence of RL-based intelligent attacks.},

abstract={A novel method based on the Hidden Markov Model is proposed to predict multistep attacks using IDS alerts. We consider the hidden states as similar phases of a particular type of attack. As a result, it can be easily adapted to multistep attacks and foresee the next steps of an attacker. To achieve this goal, a preliminary off-line training phase based on observations will be required. These observations are obtained by matching the IDS alert information with a database previously built for this purpose using a clusterization method from the CVE global database to avoid overfitting. The training model is performed using both unsupervised and supervised algorithms. Once the training is completed and probability matrices are computed, the prediction module compute the best state sequence based on the state probability for each step of the multistep attack in progress using the Viterbi and forward-backward algorithms. The training model includes the mean number of alerts and the number of alerts in progress to assist in obtaining the final attack probability. The model is analyzed for DDoS phases because it is a great problem in all Internet services. The proposed method is validated into a virtual DDoS scenario using current vulnerabilities. The results proving the system's ability to perform real-time prediction.},

abstract={In recent years, we have experienced a wave of DDoS attacks threatening the welfare of the internet. These are launched by malicious users whose only incentive is to degrade the performance of other, innocent, users. The traditional systems turn out to be quite vulnerable to these attacks. The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then use our vulnerability metric to evaluate a data structure which is commonly used in network mechanisms-the Hash table data structure. We show that Closed Hash is much more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than Open Hash, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent by traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queuing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Furthermore, we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a distinct kind of network where the nodes are connected by way of wireless medium and without any infrastructure. Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the mission successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of networks can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications; it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication with which it is communicating by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Moreover scalability is one of the considerable issues, because number of nodes in the MANET can increase dramatically. Clustering is an idea to provide the scalability to the MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust and cluster based authentication for MANET and also discuss their advantages and complexity and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the authentication and we have also discussed the importance of clustering and trust in MANET along with their properties.},

year={2020},
volume={8},

pages={219137-219150},
abstract={A new concept for Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), the Mirror PUF, is proposed. The Mirror PUF can be applied to existing preselected PUF circuits by post-processing the preselection test results and has the potential to double the number of effective bits, with no additional area at the bit-cell level. The Mirror PUF utilizes a preselection test, which measures the amount of mismatch within the PUF cell. This data is generally used to determine the mask for a conventional PUF. Here, it is used as an entropy source that is not correlated to the original response of the PUF. Bit-cells with low mismatch are considered as a `0' and cells with high mismatch as a `1'. A systematic method is shown for identifying unstable bits in the Mirror PUF response. It classifies the cells to `low', `medium' and `high' mismatch, such that medium mismatch bits are considered as unstable and masked from the response. The concept was applied to a 65nm Si implementation of the Capacitive Tilt PUF (Shifman et al., 2020). All of the unstable cells of the Mirror PUF, except for 0.03%, were identified and masked, with a worst-case corner Bit Error-Rate (BER) of only 2.35E-5 and 0.00026% erroneous responses across all corners. The application of the Mirror PUF to the Capacitive tilt PUF increased the number of stable response bits by 66%. No observable correlation was found between the responses of the original PUF and the Mirror PUF.},

In our formulation, every node must participate in lightweight intrusion detection of a neighbor target node. Consequently, every good node would play a set of defense strategies to faithfully defend the system while every bad node would play a set of attack strategies for achieving their own goals. We develop an analytical model based on Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) modeling techniques. Our methodology allows the optimal defense strategies to be played by good nodes to maximize the system lifetime when given a set of parameter values characterizing the distributed IoT system operational environment. We conduct a detailed performance evaluation based on an experiment dataset deriving from a reference autonomous distributed IoT system comprising 128 sensor-carrying mobile nodes and show how IDS defense mechanisms can counter malicious attack mechanisms under the ADIoTS system while considering multiple failure conditions.},

abstract={The quality of images produced by generative adversarial networks (GAN) is commonly a trade-off between the model size, its training data needs, and the generation resolution. This trad-off is clear when applying GANs to issues like generating face morphing attacks, where the latent vector used by the generator is manipulated. In this paper, we propose an image enhancement solution designed to increase the quality and resolution of GAN-generated images. The solution is designed to require limited training data and be extendable to higher resolutions. We successfully apply our solution on GAN-based face morphing attacks. Beside the face recognition vulnerability and attack detectability analysis, we prove that the images enhanced by our solution are of higher visual and quantitative quality in comparison to unprocessed attacks and attack images enhanced by state-of-the-art super-resolution approaches.},

abstract={Since convolutional neural network (CNN) can only extract local features, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model has a large number of learning calculations, a long processing time and an obvious degree of information loss as the length of speech increases. Utilizing the characteristics of autonomous feature extraction in deep learning, CNN and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network are combined to present an encrypted speech retrieval method based on deep perceptual hashing and CNN-BiLSTM. Firstly, the proposed method extracts the Log-Mel Spectrogram/MFCC features of the original speech and enters the CNN and BiLSTM networks in turn for model training. Secondly, we use the trained fusion network model to learn the deep perceptual feature and generate deep perceptual hashing sequences. Finally, the normalized Hamming distance algorithm is used for matching retrieval. In order to protect the speech security in the cloud, a speech encryption algorithm based on a 4D hyperchaotic system is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good discrimination, robustness, recall and precision compared with the existing methods, and it has good retrieval efficiency and retrieval accuracy for longer speech. Meanwhile, the proposed speech encryption algorithm has a high key space to resist exhaustive attacks.},

abstract={Dynamic software fingerprinting has been an important tool in fighting against software theft and pirating by embedding unique fingerprints into software copies. However, the existing work uses the methods from dynamic software watermarking as direct solutions, in which the secret marks are inside rather independent code modules attached to the software. This results in an intrinsic weakness against targeted collusive attacks, since differences among the software copies correspond directly to the fingerprint-related components. In this paper, we suggest a novel mode of the dynamic fingerprinting called integrated fingerprinting, of which the goal is to ensure all the fingerprinted software copies possess identical behaviors at semantic level. We then provide the first implementation of integrated fingerprinting called Neuroprint on top of a control flow obfuscator that replaces program's conditional structures with neural networks trained to simulate their branching behaviors. Leveraging the rich entropy in the outputs of these neural networks, Neuroprint embeds the software fingerprints, such that a one-time construction of the networks serves both the purposes of obfuscation and fingerprinting. Evaluations show that due to the incomprehensibility of neural networks, it is infeasible to de-obfuscate the software transformed by Neuroprint or attack the fingerprint using even the latest program analysis techniques. Revealing information regarding the hidden fingerprints via collusive attacks on Neuroprint is difficult as well. Finally, Neuroprint also demonstrates negligible runtime overhead.},

abstract={Universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), a.k.a. input-agnostic perturbations, has been proved to exist and be able to fool cutting-edge deep learning models on most of the data samples. Existing UAP methods mainly focus on attacking image classification models. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to attacking image retrieval systems. In this paper, we make the first attempt in attacking image retrieval systems. Concretely, image retrieval attack is to make the retrieval system return irrelevant images to the query at the top ranking list. It plays an important role to corrupt the neighbourhood relationships among features in image retrieval attack. To this end, we propose a novel method to generate retrieval-against UAP to break the neighbourhood relationships of image features via degrading the corresponding ranking metric. To expand the attack method to scenarios with varying input sizes or untouchable network parameters, a multi-scale random resizing scheme and a ranking distillation strategy are proposed. We evaluate the proposed method on four widely-used image retrieval datasets, and report a significant performance drop in terms of different metrics, such as mAP and mP@10. Finally, we test our attack methods on the real-world visual search engine, i.e., Google Images, which demonstrates the practical potentials of our methods.},

abstract={Mining knowledge from human mobility, such as discriminating motion traces left by different anonymous users, also known as the trajectory-user linking (TUL) problem, is an important task in many applications requiring location-based services (LBSs). However, it inevitably raises an issue that may be aggravated by TUL, i.e., how to defend against location attacks (e.g., deanonymization and location recovery). In this work, we present a Semisupervised Trajectory- User Linking model with Interpretable representation and Gaussian mixture prior (STULIG)—a novel deep probabilistic framework for jointly learning disentangled representation of user trajectories in a semisupervised manner and tackling the location recovery problem. STULIG characterizes multiple latent aspects of human trajectories and their labels into separate latent variables, which can be then used to interpret user check-in styles and improve the performance of trace classification. It can also generate synthetic yet plausible trajectories, thus protecting users’ actual locations while preserving the meaningful mobility information for various machine learning tasks. We analyze and evaluate STULIG’s ability to learn disentangled representations, discriminating human traces and generating realistic motions on several real-world mobility data sets. As demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations, in addition to outperforming the state-of-the-art methods, our method provides intuitive explanations of the classification and generation and sheds lights on the interpretable mobility mining.},

Traditionally, this problem is tackled by placing strict constraints on the transformation vector or by incorporating optical flow through a complex pipeline. We propose an alternative approach that utilizes a compositional re-estimation process for camera pose estimation. Given an input, we first estimate a depth map. Our method then iteratively estimates the camera motion based on the estimated depth map. Our approach significantly improves the predicted camera motion both quantitatively and visually. Furthermore, the re-estimation resolves the problem of out-of-boundaries pixels in a novel and simple way. Another advantage of our approach is that it is adaptable to other camera pose estimation approaches. Experimental analysis on KITTI benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised camera ego-motion estimation.},

abstract={With rapid advances in sensor, computer, and communication networks, modern power systems have become complicated cyber-physical systems. Assessing and enhancing cyber-physical system security is, therefore, of utmost importance for the future electricity grid. In a successful false data injection attack (FDIA), an attacker compromises measurements from grid sensors in such a way that undetected errors are introduced into estimates of state variables such as bus voltage angles and magnitudes. In evading detection by commonly employed residue-based bad data detection tests, FDIAs are capable of severely threatening power system security. Since the first published research on FDIAs in 2009, research into FDIA-based cyber-attacks has been extensive. This paper gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art in FDIAs against modern power systems. This paper first summarizes the theoretical basis of FDIAs, and then discusses both the physical and the economic impacts of a successful FDIA. This paper presents the basic defense strategies against FDIAs and discusses some potential future research directions in this field.},

First, we demonstrate that the moving preference of individuals can be exploited to perform re-identification attacks, which may cause serious damage to the identity privacy of users. To address this re-identification problem, we present a new trajectory anonymity model, in which the degree of correlation between parking locations and individuals is precisely characterized by a concept of Location Frequency-inverse user frequency (LF-IUF, for short). We then propose an anonymizing method to replace parking locations by a k-correlation region. Our method provides a novel anonymity solution for publishing trajectory data, which achieves a better trade off between privacy and utility. Finally, we run a set of experiments on real-world data sets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={Responding to an emergency situation is a challenging and time critical procedure. The primary goal is to save lives and this is directly related to the speed and efficiency at which help is provided to the victims. Rescue robots are able to benefit an emergency response procedure by searching for survivors, providing access to inaccessible areas and establishing an on-site communication network. This paper investigates how a cyber attack on a rescue robot can adversely affect its operation and impair an emergency response operation. The focus is on identifying physical indicators of an ongoing cyber attack, which can help to design more efficient detection and defense mechanisms. A number of experiments have been conducted on an Arduino based robot, under different cyber attack scenarios. The results show that the cyber attack's effects have physical features that can be used in order to improve the robot's robustness against this type of threat.},

abstract={There has been an increased interest in the application of convolutional neural networks for image based malware classification, but the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial examples allows malicious actors to evade classifiers. Adversarial examples are usually generated by adding small perturbations to the input that are unrecognizable to humans, but the same approach is not effective with malware. In general, these perturbations cause changes in the byte sequences that change the initial functionality or result in un-executable binaries. We present a generative model for executable adversarial malware examples using obfuscation that achieves a high misclassification rate, up to 100% and 98% in white-box and black-box settings respectively, and demonstrates transferability. We further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by reporting insignificant change in the evasion rate of our adversarial examples against popular defense strategies.},

abstract={Building safeguards against illegitimate access and authentication is a cornerstone for securing systems. Existing user authentication schemes suffer from challenges in detecting impersonation attacks which leave systems vulnerable and susceptible to misuse. A range of research proposals have suggested continuous multimodal biometric authentication (CMBA) systems as a reliable solution. Though contemporary authentication systems have the potential to change their current authentication scheme, there is a lack of critical analysis of current progress in the field to foster and influence practical solutions. This paper provides a systematic survey of existing literature on CMBA systems, followed by analysis to identify and discuss current research and future trends. The study has found that many diverse biometric characteristics are used for multimodal biometric authentication systems. The majority of the studies in the literature reviewed apply supervised learning approaches as a classification technique, and score level fusion is predominantly used as a fusion model. The review has determined however that there is a lack of comparative analysis on CMBA design in terms of combinations of biometric types (behavioural only, physiological only, or both), machine learning algorithms (unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning), and fusion models. Most of the studies evaluated a CMBA system's accuracy functionality, such as False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER). However, security, scalability and usability (user acceptance and satisfaction) are generally not addressed thoroughly even though these are key factors for system success in a real deployment. Furthermore, a CMBA system should be implemented and evaluated extensively on real data without restriction to prove that such systems are feasible.},

abstract={The detection of malware have developed for many years, and the appearance of new machine learning and deep learning techniques have improved the effect of detectors. However, most of current researches have focused on the general features of malware and ignored the development of the malware themselves, so that the features could be useless with the time passed as well as the advance of malware techniques. Besides, the detection methods based on machine learning are mainly static detection and analysis, while the study of real-time detection of malware is relatively rare. In this article, we proposed a new model that could detect malware real-time in principle and learn new features adaptively. Firstly, a new data structure of API-Pair was adopted, and the constructed data was trained with Maximum Entropy model, which could satisfy the goal of weighting and adaptive learning. Then a clustering was practised to filter relatively unrelated and confusing features. Moreover, a detector based on Lont Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) was devised to achieve the goal of real-time detection. Finally, a series of experiments were designed to verify our method. The experimental results showed that our model could obtain the highest accuracy of 99.07% in general tests and keep the accuracies above 97% with the development of malware; the results also proved the feasibility of our model in real-time detection through the simulation experiment, and robustness against a typical adversarial attack.},

abstract={Our economy, military, and our society as a whole is entirely dependent on our utility infrastructure. This fact makes network security of critical importance to both the public and private sectors. Information about the vulnerability of multi-networks is critical from a defensive point of view, and it may not be immediately obvious which component is the most critical module of an infrastructure system without a sophisticated analysis. Many real-world systems have an inherently hierarchical structure in which the leader and the follower have opposite goals. This makes it of critical importance to develop bi-level models which are representative of reality and also computationally tractable. In this paper we design a nested hierarchical evolutionary model in which the attacker evolves as the defender attempts to maximize flow in their multi-commodity network. This scheme takes advantage of the ability to solve Mixed Integer Linear Programing problems (MILPs) extremely quickly using existing maximum flow techniques, while solving the NP-hard bi-level optimization problem heuristically, as our algorithm evolves towards optimality from the attacker's perspective.},

abstract={Following the trend of online social networks (OSNs) data sharing and publishing, users raise serious concerns on OSN privacy. Differential privacy is a mechanism to anonymize sensitive data. It employs graph abstraction models, such as the hierarchical random graph (HRG) model, to extract graph features and then add sufficient noise. However, the noise amount, determined by the sensitivity, is usually proportional to the size of the whole network. Therefore, achieving global differential privacy may harm the utility of releasing graphs. In this paper, we define the notion of group-based local differential privacy. In particular, by resolving the network into 1-neighborhood graphs and applying HRG-based methods, our scheme preserves differential privacy and reduces the noise scale on the local graphs. By deploying the grouping algorithm, our scheme abandons the attempt to anonymize every relationship to be ordinary, but we focus on the similarities in HRG models. In the final released graph, each individual user in one group is not distinguishable, which greatly enhances the OSN privacy. We experimentally evaluate our approach on three real-world OSNs. It produces synthetic graphs that are more closely matched with the originals compared with the existing differential-privacy results.},

abstract={The performance of resilient state estimators developed for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) decreases as the number of compromised sensors of the system increases. Furthermore, some of these algorithms leverage computationally expensive optimization techniques to incorporate resiliency. As such, we propose a fast resilient distributed state estimator (FRDSE), which is a novel resilient distributed algorithm that produces bounded state estimation errors regardless of the magnitude of the attack and the number of compromised sensors. Our algorithm converges to the true state in an attack-free and noise-free scenario and it produces bounded estimation errors during an attack. Compared to existing algorithms, FRDSE is more computationally efficient. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of FRDSE in attack-free scenario and prove its resiliency during an attack. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm against false data injection (FDI) attack in a platoon of vehicles and compare its runtime against existing algorithms. We observe that on a platoon of eight vehicles, runtime of our algorithm is 0.102 s, much lower than the state-of-the-art solutions.},

abstract={Within the next decade, the need for automation, intelligent data handling and pre-processing is expected to increase in order to cope with the vast amount of information generated by a heavily connected and digitalised world. Over the past decades, modern computer networks, infrastructures and digital devices have grown in both complexity and interconnectivity. Cyber security personnel protecting these assets have been confronted with increasing attack surfaces and advancing attack patterns. In order to manage this, cyber defence methods began to rely on automation and (artificial) intelligence supporting the work of humans. However, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) supported methods have not only been integrated in network monitoring and endpoint security products but are almost omnipresent in any application involving constant monitoring, complex or large volumes of data. Intelligent IDS, automated cyber defence, network monitoring and surveillance as well as secure software development and orchestration are all examples of assets that are reliant on ML and automation. These applications are of considerable interest to malicious actors due to their importance to society. Furthermore, ML and AI methods are also used in audio-visual systems utilised by digital assistants, autonomous vehicles, face-recognition applications and many others. Successful attack vectors targeting the AI of audio-visual systems have already been reported. These attacks range from requiring little technical knowledge to complex attacks hijacking the underlying AI.With the increasing dependence of society on ML and AI, we must prepare for the next generation of cyber attacks being directed against these areas. Attacking a system through its learning and automation methods allows attackers to severely damage the system, while at the same time allowing them to operate covertly. The combination of being inherently hidden through the manipulation made, its devastating impact and the wide unawareness of AI and ML vulnerabilities make attack vectors against AI and ML highly favourable for malicious operators. Furthermore, AI systems tend to be difficult to analyse post-incident as well as to monitor during operations. Discriminating a compromised from an uncompromised AI in real-time is still considered difficult.In this paper, we report on the state of the art of attack patterns directed against AI and ML methods. We derive and discuss the attack surface of prominent learning mechanisms utilised in AI systems. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of AI and ML attacks for the next decade of cyber conflicts as well as mitigations strategies and their limitations.},

volume={17},

abstract={Mathematical modeling of cardiac electrical signals facilitates the simulation of realistic cardiac electrical behaviors, the evaluation of algorithms, and the characterization of underlying space-time patterns. However, there are practical issues pertinent to model efficacy, robustness, and generality. This paper presents a multiscale adaptive basis function modeling approach to characterize not only temporal but also spatial behaviors of vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals. Model parameters are adaptively estimated by the “best matching” projections of VCG characteristic waves onto a dictionary of nonlinear basis functions. The model performance is experimentally evaluated with respect to the number of basis functions, different types of basis function (i.e., Gaussian, Mexican hat, customized wavelet, and Hermitian wavelets), and various cardiac conditions, including 80 healthy controls and different myocardial infarctions (i.e., 89 inferior, 77 anterior-septal, 56 inferior-lateral, 47 anterior, and 43 anterior-lateral). Multiway analysis of variance shows that the basis function and the model complexity have significant effects on model performances while cardiac conditions are not significant. The customized wavelet is found to be an optimal basis function for the modeling of spacetime VCG signals. The comparison of QT intervals shows small relative errors (<;5%) between model representations and realworld VCG signals when the model complexity is greater than 10. The proposed model shows great potentials to model space-time cardiac pathological behaviors and can lead to potential benefits in feature extraction, data compression, algorithm evaluation, and disease prognostics.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices with their network services are often vulnerable to attacks because they are not designed for security. Especially with the rapid technological advances that make data increase exponentially. This is targeted by malicious users to exploit vulnerabilities or interfere with many vulnerability attacks. Therefore, deal with this vulnerability, an intrusion detection system that involves machine learning techniques is needed. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is targeted to get intrusion in a communication system by looking at the IDS types and methods. This is influenced by the characteristics of the IoT network involved and the reference dataset used in the detection system. This dataset determines the categories or classes of attacks upon which the IDS decides whether or not to intrusion. Reference databases that already exist and are often used, such as KDD Cup 99, NSL KDD, and attack datasets obtained from conditions. In developing IDS in IoT Device, the Machine Learning approach can be used to solve the type of algorithm used consisting of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or Reinforcement learning. These algorithm methods can be used include SVM, Decision Tree, K-NN, ANN, RNN, and others. From the review analysis of dominant research conducted in 2015-2020, the largest percentage was obtained using the artificial neural network and deep learning algorithm for the intrusion classification process, with details of 16% ANN, 12% RNN, and DNN.},

In this paper, a novel secure outsourcing scheme, combining disguising technique and code obfuscation, was proposed to enable efficient outsourcing while preserving the confidentiality of the information.

If any of this information were to fall into the hands of hackers, it would be devastating for the company. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based approach to detecting abnormal behaviour in smartphone applications. First we carry out various robust clustering techniques that help to identify and regroup applications that exhibit similar behaviour. The clustering results are then used to define a cluster-based outlier factor for each application, which in turn identifies the top n malware applications. Initial results of the experiments prove the efficiency and accuracy of cluster-based approaches in detecting abnormal smartphone applications and those with a low false-alert rate.},

pages={10353-10362},
abstract={Deep neural networks have made tremendous progress in 3D point-cloud recognition. Recent works have shown that these 3D recognition networks are also vulnerable to adversarial samples produced from various attack methods, including optimization-based 3D Carlini-Wagner attack, gradient-based iterative fast gradient method, and skeleton-detach based point-dropping. However, after a careful analysis, these methods are either extremely slow because of the optimization/iterative scheme, or not flexible to support targeted attack of a specific category. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel label guided adversarial network (LG-GAN) for real-time flexible targeted point cloud attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation based 3D point cloud attack method. By feeding the original point clouds and target attack label into LG-GAN, it can learn how to deform the point clouds to mislead the recognition network into the specific label only with a single forward pass. In detail, LG-GAN first leverages one multi-branch adversarial network to extract hierarchical features of the input point clouds, then incorporates the specified label information into multiple intermediate features using the label encoder. Finally, the encoded features will be fed into the coordinate reconstruction decoder to generate the target adversarial sample. By evaluating different point-cloud recognition models (e.g., PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN), we demonstrate that the proposed LG-GAN can support flexible targeted attack on the fly while guaranteeing good attack performance and higher efficiency simultaneously.},

abstract={Automatic speech recognition systems use noise compensation and acoustic model adaptation to increase robustness towards speaker and environmental variation. The current work focuses on noise compensation with bounded conditional mean imputation (BCMI). BCMI approaches are missing-data methods which operate on the assumption that noise-corrupted observations can be divided into reliable and unreliable components. BCMI methods substitute the unreliable components with a clean speech posterior distribution. The posterior means can be used as clean speech estimates and the posterior variances can be introduced in acoustic model likelihood calculation as observation uncertainties. In addition, we propose in the current work that similar uncertainties are introduced in acoustic model adaptation. Evaluation with speech data recorded in diverse public and car environments indicates that the proposed uncertainties improve adaptation performance. When uncertainties were used in acoustic model likelihood calculation and adaptation, the proposed imputation and adaptation system introduced 15%-84% relative error reductions to an uncompensated baseline system performance.},

abstract={Person re-identification (re-ID) is a key problem in smart supervision of camera networks. Over the past years, models using deep learning have become state of the art. However, it has been shown that deep neural networks are flawed with adversarial examples, i.e. human-imperceptible perturbations. Extensively studied for the task of image closed- set classification, this problem can also appear in the case of open-set retrieval tasks. Indeed, recent work has shown that we can also generate adversarial examples for metric learning systems such as re-ID ones. These models remain vulnerable: when faced with adversarial examples, they fail to correctly recognize a person, which represents a security breach. These attacks are all the more dangerous as they are impossible to detect for a human operator. Attacking a metric consists in altering the distances between the feature of an attacked image and those of reference images, i.e. guides. In this article, we investigate different possible attacks depending on the number and type of guides available. From this metric attack family, two particularly effective attacks stand out. The first one, called Self Metric Attack, is a strong attack that does not need any image apart from the attacked image. The second one, called FurthestNegative Attack, makes full use of a set of images. Attacks are evaluated on commonly used datasets: Market1501 and DukeMTMC. Finally, we propose an efficient extension of adversarial training protocol adapted to metric learning as a defense that increases the robustness of re-ID models.1},

Though all of these evolving technologies mostly focus on performance guarantees, it is still being a major concern how these systems can ensure the security and privacy of the information they handle. Different datastores support different types of integrated security mechanisms, however, most of the non-relational database systems have overlooked the security requirements of modern Big Data applications. This paper reviews security implementations in today's leading database models giving more emphasis on security and privacy attributes. A set of standard security mechanisms have been identified and evaluated based on different security classifications. Further, it provides a thorough review and a comprehensive analysis on maturity of security and privacy implementations in these database models along with future directions/enhancements so that data owners can decide on most appropriate datastore for their data-driven Big Data applications.},

abstract={Smart Cyber Physical Grids are the new wave of power system technology that integrates networks of sensors with power stations for more efficient power generation and distribution. While utilizing communication networks is accompanied with tremendous advantages, it also increases the vulnerability of power systems to cyber attacks. Many methods for security and attack detection have been proposed in literature; however, most papers do not consider the imbalance of data in real power systems. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method, referred to as Ensemble Stacked AutoEncoder (ESAE), aimed at tackling the problem of data imbalance. This method achieves superior performance on imbalanced data by developing a deep representation learning model to construct new balanced representations. The detection accuracy and model performance is improved by utilizing an ensemble architecture based on Stacked Autoencoders and Random Forest classifiers to detect attacks from the new representations. The proposed method is tested on all degrees of data imbalance using test cases of IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 57-bus systems. Comparisons are made to several classifiers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={Deep learning is widely used in the medical field owing to its high accuracy in medical image classification and biological applications. However, under collaborative deep learning, there is a serious risk of information leakage based on the deep convolutional generation against the network's privacy protection method. Moreover, the risk of such information leakage is greater in the medical field. This paper proposes a deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) based privacy protection method to protect the information of collaborative deep learning training and enhance its stability. The proposed method adopts encrypted transmission in the process of deep network parameter transmission. By setting the buried point to detect a generative adversarial network (GAN) attack in the network and adjusting the training parameters, training based on the GAN model attack is forced to be invalid, and the information is effectively protected.},

pages={2225-2240},
abstract={A botnet is a network of remote-controlled devices that are infected with malware controlled by botmasters in order to launch cyber attacks. To evade detection, the botmaster frequently changes the domain name of his Command and Control (C&C) server. Notice that most of these types of domain names are generated by domain generation algorithms (DGAs). In this paper, we propose Khaos, a novel DGA with high anti-detection ability based on neural language models and the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The key insight of our research is that real domain names are composed of readable syllables and acronyms, and thus we can arrange syllables and acronyms using neural language models to mimic real domain names. In Khaos, we first find the most common n-grams in real domain names, then tokenize these domain names into n-grams, and finally synthesize new domain names after learning arrangements of n-grams from real domain names. We carry out experiments using a variety of state-of-the-art DGA detection approaches: the statistics-based, the distribution-based, the LSTM-based and the graph-based detection approach. Our experimental results show that the average distance for detecting Khaos under the distribution-based detection approach is 0.64, the AUCs of Khaos under the statistics-based and the LSTM-based detection approach are 0.76 and 0.57, respectively, and the precision of Khaos under the graph-based detection approach is 0.68. Our work proves that the existing detection approaches have big troubles in detecting Khaos, and Khaos has better anti-detection ability than state-of-the-art DGAs. In addition, we find that training the existing detection approach on a dataset including the domain names generated by Khaos can improve its detection ability.},

abstract={Smart grid is susceptance to a variety of cyber attacks, among which False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) are shown to be of significantly disruptive nature. Complex, distributed, and interconnected aspects of smart grids make detection of stealthy FDIAs with high accuracy significantly challenging. To address this issue, the paper proposes an innovative Adaptive Multi-Level Features Classification for Stealthy FDIA Detection (AMLFC-SFD) based on the Alternating Current (AC) state estimation. More specifically, we focus on maintaining a trade-off between the accuracy rate of detection and its associated computational complexity by utilizing two different Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifiers, in which the number of features as the input of the classifier depends on the strength of the underlying attack. In this regard, we divide potential FDI attacks in smart grids into three decision regions, including strong, moderate, and weak attacks and obtain the most accurate Kernel to separate measurements. To evaluate the proposed AMLFC-SFD framework, comprehensive numerical experiments are performed based on the IEEE 30-bus system. Results illustrate that with a lower number of features a reasonably high detection accuracy can be achieved, leading to a considerably less run time, which is of paramount importance for practical implementation.},

abstract={The classification accuracy of electrocardiogram(ECG) signals will decrease when the labels of some samples in the training set are incorrect. To mitigate this negative impact, the semi-supervised method is introduced to correct the mislabeled samples. The proposed method is based on the basic principle that the characteristics of samples of the same category are more similar than those of samples of different categories, so in the feature space,the number of samples of the same category around a sample is more than that of different categories. Cross validation is used to divide the training set into sub training set and validation set, and the samples in the validation set are regarded as unlabeled, k nearest neighbour(KNN) classifier label the samples in the validation set according to the samples in the sub training set. Because there are mislabeled samples in the sub training set, it is difficult for KNN classifier to label all samples in the validation set correctly at one time. So we need to use the above method iteratively. Thus, the mislabeled samples in the training set is basically corrected. Experients on the ECG signal corrected from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show the eectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Today's systems produce a rapidly exploding amount of data, and the data further derives more data, forming a complex data propagation network that we call the data's lineage. There are many reasons that users want systems to forget certain data including its lineage. From a privacy perspective, users who become concerned with new privacy risks of a system often want the system to forget their data and lineage. From a security perspective, if an attacker pollutes an anomaly detector by injecting manually crafted data into the training data set, the detector must forget the injected data to regain security. From a usability perspective, a user can remove noise and incorrect entries so that a recommendation engine gives useful recommendations. Therefore, we envision forgetting systems, capable of forgetting certain data and their lineages, completely and quickly. This paper focuses on making learning systems forget, the process of which we call machine unlearning, or simply unlearning. We present a general, efficient unlearning approach by transforming learning algorithms used by a system into a summation form. To forget a training data sample, our approach simply updates a small number of summations -- asymptotically faster than retraining from scratch. Our approach is general, because the summation form is from the statistical query learning in which many machine learning algorithms can be implemented. Our approach also applies to all stages of machine learning, including feature selection and modeling. Our evaluation, on four diverse learning systems and real-world workloads, shows that our approach is general, effective, fast, and easy to use.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are gaining more and more interest in the research community due to their unique characteristics. Besides energy consumption considerations, security has emerged as an equally important aspect in their network design. WSNs are vulnerable to various types of attacks, and as such, they require mechanisms to defend against them. Several anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed to date as a solution to the problem. However, none of them is specifically designed for the ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. UWB is a key solution for wireless connectivity characterized by ultra low power consumption, and high precision ranging. Based on these principles, we propose a novel anomaly detection and localization algorithm for cluster-based UWB wireless sensor networks. Towards securing the cluster formation protocol, we also define a novel, trust-aware leader election metric. The performance of the proposed algorithm in identifying intrusions using a rule-based detection technique is studied via simulations.},

The collected industrial control data are normalized and a new information gain ratio feature selection method considering feature correlation and redundancy is proposed to choose the best feature subset from the network connection data. According to the extracted training sample feature subset, the maximum entropy model is devoted to construct the classifier, and finally the trained classifier is applied for intrusion detection.

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the system security, but few of them can effectively resist response injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection, especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IDS mechanism.},

abstract={Face morphing attacks target to circumvent Face Recognition Systems (FRS) by employing face images derived from multiple data subjects (e.g., accomplices and malicious actors). Morphed images can be verified against contributing data subjects with a reasonable success rate, given they have a high degree of facial resemblance. The success of morphing attacks is directly dependent on the quality of the generated morph images. We present a new approach for generating strong attacks extending our earlier framework for generating face morphs. We present a new approach using an Identity Prior Driven Generative Adversarial Network, which we refer to as MIPGAN (Morphing through Identity Prior driven GAN). The proposed MIPGAN is derived from the StyleGAN with a newly formulated loss function exploiting perceptual quality and identity factor to generate a high quality morphed facial image with minimal artefacts and with high resolution. We demonstrate the proposed approach’s applicability to generate strong morphing attacks by evaluating its vulnerability against both commercial and deep learning based Face Recognition System (FRS) and demonstrate the success rate of attacks. Extensive experiments are carried out to assess the FRS’s vulnerability against the proposed morphed face generation technique on three types of data such as digital images, re-digitized (printed and scanned) images, and compressed images after re-digitization from newly generated MIPGAN Face Morph Dataset. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach of morph generation poses a high threat to FRS.},

abstract={Cybersecurity community is slowly leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to combat ever evolving threats. One of the biggest drivers for successful adoption of these models is how well domain experts and users are able to understand and trust their functionality. As these black-box models are being employed to make important predictions, the demand for transparency and explainability is increasing from the stakeholders.Explanations supporting the output of ML models are crucial in cyber security, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary output for their analysis. Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) creating and improving explainability methods which help users better understand the internal workings of ML models and their outputs; (b) attacks on interpreters in white box setting; (c) defining the exact properties and metrics of the explanations generated by models. However, they have not covered, the security properties and threat models relevant to cybersecurity domain, and attacks on explainable models in black box settings.In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a taxonomy for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, covering various security properties and threat models relevant to cyber security domain. We design a novel black box attack for analyzing the consistency, correctness and confidence security properties of gradient based XAI methods. We validate our proposed system on 3 security-relevant data-sets and models, and demonstrate that the method achieves attacker's goal of misleading both the classifier and explanation report and, only explainability method without affecting the classifier output. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and can help in designing secure and robust XAI methods.},

abstract={Bad Data Injection (BDI) in Smart Grid is considered to be the most dangerous cyber attack, as it might lead to energy theft on the end users, false dispatch on the distribution process, and device breakdown on the power generation. State Estimation and Bad Data Detection, which are applied to reduce the observation errors and detect false data in the traditional power grid, could not detect the bad data in smart grid. In this paper, three BDI attack cases in IEEE 14-bus system are designed to bypass the traditional bad data detection. The potential risks on economy and security are analyzed exploiting the MATPOWER. A new method based on Distributed State Estimation (DSE) is proposed to detect BDI, named as DSE-based bad data detection. The power system is divided into several subsystems, and a Chi-squares test is applied to detect the bad data respectively in each subsystem. Simulation results demonstrate that the DSE-based bad data detection can detect all bad data in three attack cases. Moreover, it can locate the bad data in specific subsystem which is helpful for the further identification.},

abstract={Cloud security is one of most important issues that has attracted a lot of research and development effort in past few years. Particularly, attackers can explore vulnerabilities of a cloud system and compromise virtual machines to deploy further large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). DDoS attacks usually involve early stage actions such as multistep exploitation, low-frequency vulnerability scanning, and compromising identified vulnerable virtual machines as zombies, and finally DDoS attacks through the compromised zombies. Within the cloud system, especially the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds, the detection of zombie exploration attacks is extremely difficult. This is because cloud users may install vulnerable applications on their virtual machines. To prevent vulnerable virtual machines from being compromised in the cloud, we propose a multiphase distributed vulnerability detection, measurement, and countermeasure selection mechanism called NICE, which is built on attack graph-based analytical models and reconfigurable virtual network-based countermeasures. The proposed framework leverages OpenFlow network programming APIs to build a monitor and control plane over distributed programmable virtual switches to significantly improve attack detection and mitigate attack consequences. The system and security evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

abstract={Recently, a new paradigm of building general-purpose language models (e.g., Google's Bert and OpenAI's GPT-2) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text feature extraction, a standard procedure in NLP systems that converts texts to vectors (i.e., embeddings) for downstream modeling, has arisen and starts to find its application in various downstream NLP tasks and real world systems (e.g., Google's search engine [6]). To obtain general-purpose text embeddings, these language models have highly complicated architectures with millions of learnable parameters and are usually pretrained on billions of sentences before being utilized. As is widely recognized, such a practice indeed improves the state-of-the-art performance of many downstream NLP tasks. However, the improved utility is not for free. We find the text embeddings from general-purpose language models would capture much sensitive information from the plain text. Once being accessed by the adversary, the embeddings can be reverse-engineered to disclose sensitive information of the victims for further harassment. Although such a privacy risk can impose a real threat to the future leverage of these promising NLP tools, there are neither published attacks nor systematic evaluations by far for the mainstream industry-level language models. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study on the privacy risks of 8 state-of-the-art language models with 4 diverse case studies. By constructing 2 novel attack classes, our study demonstrates the aforementioned privacy risks do exist and can impose practical threats to the application of general-purpose language models on sensitive data covering identity, genome, healthcare and location. For example, we show the adversary with nearly no prior knowledge can achieve about 75% accuracy when inferring the precise disease site from Bert embeddings of patients' medical descriptions. As possible countermeasures, we propose 4 different defenses (via rounding, differential privacy, adversarial training and subspace projection) to obfuscate the unprotected embeddings for mitigation purpose. With extensive evaluations, we also provide a preliminary analysis on the utility-privacy trade-off brought by each defense, which we hope may foster future mitigation researches.},

abstract={Monitoring of the high-performance computing systems and their components, such as clusters, grids and federations of clusters, is performed using monitoring systems for servers and networks, or Network Monitoring Systems (NMS). These monitoring tools assist system administrators in assessing and improving the health of their infrastructure. A successful attack on the infrastructure monitoring tools grants the attacker elevated power over the monitoring tasks, and eventually over some management functionality of the interface or over hosts running those interfaces. Additionally, detailed and accurate fingerprinting and reconnaissance of a target infrastructure is possible when such interfaces are publicly exposed. A successful reconnaissance allows an attacker to craft an efficient secondstage attacks, such as targeted, mimicry and blended attacks. We provide in this paper a comprehensive security analysis of some of the most popular infrastructure monitoring tools for grids, clusters and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. We also provide insights based on the infrastructure data openly exposed over the Internet. The wide use of some of the most popular infrastructure monitoring tools makes this data exposure possible. For example, we found such monitoring interfaces to expose infrastructure details of systems inside many high-profile organizations, including two top national laboratories for nuclear research and one top Internet non-profit foundation. We also present our findings on a plethora of web vulnerabilities in the entire version-span of such monitoring tools, and discuss at a high-level the possible attacks. The results of our research allow us to “monitor” an “alarming” mismanagement reality of grid infrastructure. The aim of this work is to raise the awareness about this novel risk to cloud infrastructure.},

abstract={The omnipresent nature of the Internet makes everything vulnerable against DoS attacks in IoT environments. An adversary tries to mount attacks to serve his/her nefarious purposes. Preventing IoT network from this type of attack is a complex and challenging problem. A game theory model is best suited to explore the network security problems. Attack and defense is a continuous game in network security. A defender tries to neutralise an attack by using his secret defensive method while an attacker attempts to defeat the security mechanism. They both compete against each other's methods. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model which uses the nash equilibrium to expose an adversary's attack attempt and verify the defense mechanism against the same attack. In this work, a combination of Naïve- bayes with K-means clustering algorithm is used to evaluate the unlabelled data and explore malware attacks. We have also proposed a solution to mitigate IoT attacks using a firewall and an IDS.},

abstract={This letter proposes a deep learning approach to detect a change in the antenna orientation of transmitter or receiver as a physical tamper attack in OFDM systems using channel state information. We treat the physical tamper attack problem as a semi-supervised anomaly detection problem and utilize a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) to tackle it. The past observations of the estimated channel state information (CSI) are used to train the DCAE. Then, a post-processing is deployed on the trained DCAE output to perform the physical tamper detection. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach, deployed in an office and a hall environment, is able to detect on average 99.6% of tamper events (TPR = 99.6%) while creating zero false alarms (FPR = 0%).},

abstract={We present a semi-supervised approach for semantic mapping, by introducing human knowledge after unsupervised place categorization has been combined with an adaptive cell decomposition of an occupancy map. Place categorization is based on clustering features extracted from raycasting in the occupancy map. The cell decomposition is provided by work we published previously, which is effective for the maps that could be abstracted by straight lines. Compared to related methods, our approach obviates the need for a low-level link between human knowledge and the perception and mapping sub-system, or the onerous preparation of training data for supervised learning. Application scenarios include intelligent warehouse robots which need a heightened awareness in order to operate with a higher degree of autonomy and flexibility, and integrate more fully with inventory management systems. The approach is shown to be robust and flexible with respect to different types of environments and sensor setups.},

abstract={Biometrics is a key technology for the authentication of individuals. As far as malicious impersonation attempt cannot be put an end, security is essential for biometric authentication systems. The security of biometric authentication systems is conventionally measured by false acceptance rate (FAR), the average probability of falsely accepting an individual claiming different identity. Since malicious attackers are not limited to use their own biometric features, clearly, FAR is not sufficient for the measure of security. On the other hand, it is pointed out that deep analysis of biometric authentication algorithms often shows that some irregular artificial patterns give very high acceptance rate against large portion of registered human templates. This is called wolf attack. Including this class of attack, in this paper, we formulate the security of biometric authentication systems, and demonstrate our recent results in fingerprint recognition systems. Finally, we introduce the theoretical framework for securing biometric authentication systems.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of IoT devices, the vulnerabilities & security issues concerned with these devices are also increasing. The lack of security mechanisms and vulnerable protocols make IoT devices easy targets for hackers, for example, the “Mirai Botnet Attack” in 2016. There is a very critical requirement for security of IoT systems. In this paper, we propose the IDRBT-IoT Secure Router (IISR), which is immune to a large number of cyber attacks. IISR protects the network against malicious activities by providing a one-step solution for securing the IoT ecosystem. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, five IoT devices, and an attacker machine. The router has been tested by conducting ten attacks namely: Deauthentication, Fake-Authentication, MAC Spoofing, Denial of Service, Port Scanning, WiFi Cracking, ARP Poisoning, DNS Spoofing, Malware Injection, and Firmware Exploitation. We developed security mechanisms for detection and mitigation of these attacks. They consist of Snort IDS rules, Arduino programming, Packet Sniffer, and configuration of connection methods. The test results show that IISR can detect and mitigate seven out of ten attacks. Thus, the initial results are encouraging.},

Using the feature obtained from wavelet decomposition of spectrogram images, we use an Augmented Radial Basis Neural Network (ARBF) to classify walking episodes.

pages={3491-3508},
abstract={Detection of cyber attacks against vehicles is of growing interest. As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model. The more reliable the network and the greater the processing demands, the greater the reduction in detection latency achieved through offloading.},

abstract={The increasing amount of malware variants seen in the wild is causing problems for Antivirus Software vendors, unable to keep up by creating signatures for each. The methods used to develop a signature, static and dynamic analysis, have various limitations. Machine learning has been used by Antivirus vendors to detect malware based on the information gathered from the analysis process. However, adversarial examples can cause machine learning algorithms to miss-classify new data. In this paper we describe a method for malware analysis by converting malware binaries to images and then preparing those images for training within a Generative Adversarial Network. These unsupervised deep neural networks are not susceptible to adversarial examples. The conversion to images from malware binaries should be faster than using dynamic analysis and it would still be possible to link malware families together. Using the Generative Adversarial Network, malware detection could be much more effective and reliable.},

abstract={The extensive application of information and communication technology (ICT) can effectively improve the operational performance of active distribution systems (ADSs). On the other hand, the use of ICT may expose the systems to cyberattacks. Since feeder automation (FA) in advanced ADS provides fast-responding self-healing capability to restore service during an outage, the potential effect of cyberattacks on ADS becomes more devastating. In this paper, two simple yet powerful cyberattack methods targeting remote terminal units (RTUs) are proposed. The physical response of ADS to malicious cyberattacks on FA is elaborately investigated considering the output fluctuation of distributed generators. The impact of this specific cyberattack on ADS is quantified by a risk assessment index measured in scale and in duration to full restoration. The probability of RTU potentially being attacked is modeled based on search theory. Furthermore, a Bayesian attack graph model is applied and designed to quantify the probability of successfully exploiting the currently known and zero-day vulnerabilities. The proposed methodology is tested and validated via using a modified three-feeder ADS and the IEEE 123 Node Test Feeder.},

The simulation results show that the traditional density-clustering based LOF algorithm can effectively identify FDA, but the detection performance on DDA is not satisfactory. Therefore, we propose the improved LOF algorithm to detect DDA by setting reasonable density threshold.},

abstract={Large datasets of real network flows acquired from the Internet are an invaluable resource for the research community. Applications include network modeling and simulation, identification of security attacks, and validation of research results. Unfortunately, network flows carry extremely sensitive information, and this discourages the publication of those datasets. Indeed, existing techniques for network flow sanitization are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and solutions proposed for microdata anonymity cannot be directly applied to network traces. In our previous research, we proposed an obfuscation technique for network flows, providing formal confidentiality guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. In this paper, we identify the threats posed by the incremental release of network flows, we propose a novel defense algorithm, and we formally prove the achieved confidentiality guarantees. An extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm for incremental obfuscation, carried out with billions of real Internet flows, shows that our obfuscation technique preserves the utility of flows for network traffic analysis.},

abstract={Millions of people use On-line social networks (OSNs) every day and privacy of sensitive personal information is a major concern. Although OSNs provide policies and mechanisms to allow users to control who can view their data, these efforts may not be sufficient under various privacy attacks. In this paper, we study the disclosure of private information concealed on a social network under an information extraction attack. The novelty of this attack is that it combines web search with information extraction and data mining techniques to discover private information that is hidden on a social network by considering web pages outside of the given social network. We also define a quantitative measure of the risk of privacy disclosure under this and other similar attacks, given the privacy policy and protection mechanism of a social network website. We show that with some public information of a victim from a social network, it is not too difficult for the adversary to utilize this attack to find other private information of the victim hidden on the social network. Our results call for further study of the strength of privacy protection mechanisms of online social networks, and the development of new and more effective protection methods.},

abstract={Organizations are experiencing an ever-growing concern of how to identify and defend against insider threats. Those who have authorized access to sensitive organizational data are placed in a position of power that could well be abused and could cause significant damage to an organization. This could range from financial theft and intellectual property theft to the destruction of property and business reputation. Traditional intrusion detection systems are neither designed nor capable of identifying those who act maliciously within an organization. In this paper, we describe an automated system that is capable of detecting insider threats within an organization. We define a tree-structure profiling approach that incorporates the details of activities conducted by each user and each job role and then use this to obtain a consistent representation of features that provide a rich description of the user's behavior. Deviation can be assessed based on the amount of variance that each user exhibits across multiple attributes, compared against their peers. We have performed experimentation using ten synthetic data-driven scenarios and found that the system can identify anomalous behavior that may be indicative of a potential threat. We also show how our detection system can be combined with visual analytics tools to support further investigation by an analyst.},

abstract={In federated learning, the central server combines local model updates from the clients in the network to create an aggregated model. To protect clients’ privacy, the server is designed to have no visibility into how these updates are generated. The nature of federated learning makes detecting and defending against malicious model updates a challenging task. Unlike existing works that struggle to defend against Byzantine clients, the paper considers defending against targeted model poisoning attack in the federated learning setting. The adversary aims to reduce the model performance on targeted subtasks while maintaining the main task’s performance. This paper proposes Fedcvae, a robust and unsupervised federated learning framework where the central server uses conditional variational autoencoder to detect and exclude malicious model updates. Since the reconstruction error of malicious updates is much larger than that of benign ones, it can be used as an anomaly score. We formulate a dynamic threshold of reconstruction error to differentiate malicious updates from normal ones based on this idea. Fedcvae is tested with extensive experiments on IID and non-IID federated benchmarks, showing a competitive performance over existing aggregation methods under Byzantine attack and targeted model poisoning attack.},

pages={2-14},
abstract={An adversarial machine learning approach is introduced to launch jamming attacks on wireless communications and a defense strategy is presented. A cognitive transmitter uses a pre-trained classifier to predict the current channel status based on recent sensing results and decides whether to transmit or not, whereas a jammer collects channel status and ACKs to build a deep learning classifier that reliably predicts the next successful transmissions and effectively jams them. This jamming approach is shown to reduce the transmitter's performance much more severely compared with random or sensing-based jamming. The deep learning classification scores are used by the jammer for power control subject to an average power constraint. Next, a generative adversarial network is developed for the jammer to reduce the time to collect the training dataset by augmenting it with synthetic samples. As a defense scheme, the transmitter deliberately takes a small number of wrong actions in spectrum access (in form of a causative attack against the jammer) and therefore prevents the jammer from building a reliable classifier. The transmitter systematically selects when to take wrong actions and adapts the level of defense to mislead the jammer into making prediction errors and consequently increase its throughput.},

So it is important to detect DDoS attack in SDN network. This paper presents a DDoS detection scheme based on k-means algorithm in SDN environment. The establishment of this scheme is based on the two hypotheses that the daily network works normally most of the time, and there is a significant difference between the data characteristics of normal situation and abnormal situation. At the same time, these two hypotheses are also true to the daily network condition. After demonstrating the validity of k-means clustering algorithm, the paper proposes 5 flow table features that can be used to detect DDoS attacks. Finally, the DDoS detection scheme was tested by simulation experiment. The test results showed that the method proposed by the author could effectively detect DDoS, with an average success rate of 97.78%.},

abstract={Videos are spatio-temporally rich in static to dynamic objects/scenes, sparse to dense, and periodic to non-periodic motions. Particularly, the dynamic texture (DT) exhibits complex appearance and motion changes that remain a challenge to deal with. This paper presents an energy optimization method for feature extraction and recognition in videos. For noise and background jitter, the Tikhonov regularization with eigen-vector and Frenet-Serret formula-based energy constraints is also proposed. The different periodicity of DT can be adapted by the time-varying number of learning temporal frames. The optimal duration of an image sequence is determined from the temporal property of its eigen-values. Unlike the state-of-the-art recognition methods, i.e., sparse coding and slow feature analysis, the proposed method can capture the physical property of objects and scenes: velocity, acceleration, and orientation. Also, the static and dynamic image regions can be locally classified. Owing to these spatio-temporal features, stability, robustness, and accuracy of feature extraction and recognition are enhanced. Using DT videos, the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art recognition methods is experimentally shown.},

volume={},

pages={1751-1756},
abstract={In this paper, we introduce a fast and robust scan matching method that combines the Multi-Layered Normal Distributions Transform (ML-NDT) and a feature extraction algorithm into a single framework. This is achieved by first applying the conventional NDT generation process to the reference scan, and the plane segments are extracted with the help of Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for the input scan. Thus, the proposed method provides three significant advantages with respect to conventional methods. The first one is that the proposed method is more robust to outliers since it is based on the matching of certain geometric structures. The second one is that the registration step is much faster because the number of points to be matched is very less with respect to all scanned points. Therefore, this process can be considered as a special sampling strategy. Finally, it is showed that the extracted features can also be used in feature based probabilistic SLAM methods such as Kalman Filters, Information Filters, and Particle Filters after applying merging procedure. Since the plane segments are already registered, the data association problem can be easily solved even without any odometry measurement. This can be considered as the most powerful part of the algorithm because data association problem in three dimensions is quite difficult problem. As a result, on the one hand, it is obtained a robust and fast scan matching; on the other hand, it is possible to extend the method for feature extraction algorithm in SLAM problems with a little extra computation. The method is applied to real experimental data and the results are quite affirmative.},

abstract={The examination of digital events through the prism of a quantitatively represented cultural framework allows for a new perspective on existing cyber security issues and events. When the cultural framework is applied to a large set of data, simple statistical analysis can be applied, allowing the researchers to quantify, characterize, and model specific aspects of human behavior. One advantage of quantitatively analyzing culture is that quantitative methods limit the ability of the researcher to inject implicit biases. By analyzing a large number of attacks over a 10-year period of time, exploration into patterns that may reflect cultural norms can be undertaken. This study examines a group of self-attributed attackers to determine if the chosen attack vector coincides with specific cultural values. If an attack vector can be viewed as a tool, then different cultures may exhibit preferences for specific tools. The Zone-H data collected from 2005 to 2014 for self-identified attackers in 36 countries were examined along 7 different attack vectors. These data were examined using Hofstede's cultural framework for contextual purposes. The findings showed several attack vectors that associated with unique cultural characteristics, and other attack vectors results were limited to more general characteristics. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge that support examination of cyber behaviors in cultural and provide additional insights into cyber actors' online behaviors.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) has shown its impressive performance in the modern world, and many corporations leverage the technique of machine learning to improve their service quality, e.g., Facebook's DeepFace. Machine learning models with a collection of private data being processed by a training algorithm are deemed to be increasingly confidential. Confidential models are typically trained in a centralized cloud server but publicly accessible. ML-as-a-service (MLaaS) system is one of running examples, where users are allowed to access trained models and are charged on a pay-per-query basis. Unfortunately, recent researchers have shown the tension between public access and confidential models, where adversarial access to a model is abused to duplicate the functionality of the model or even learn sensitive information about individuals (known to be in the training dataset). We conclude these attacks as prediction API threats for simplicity. In this work, we propose ML defense, a framework to defend against prediction API threats, which works as an add-on to existing MLaaS systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a technical countermeasure to attacks trumped by excessive query accesses. Our methodology neither modifies any classifier nor degrades the model functionality (e.g., rounds results). The framework consists of one or more simulators and one auditor. The simulator learns the hidden knowledge of adversaries. The auditor then detects whether there exists a privacy breach. We discuss the intrinsic difficulties and empirically state the efficiency and feasibility of our mechanisms in different models and datasets.},

abstract={This work presents a new class of cyber-physical switching attacks that targets power transmission systems. The proposed approach relies on exciting inter-area oscillation modes in a coordinated manner to drive groups of system generators out of step. Our paradigm targets inter-area oscillations by switching a relatively small part (in the order of 2%) of the system load at a (low) frequency that resonates with one of the inter-area oscillation modes observed in the power system. The switching frequency of the targeted mode is chosen through measurement-based analysis of the frequency deviation at a select bus that is observable by the adversary. The inter-area switching attack is implemented as single-load switching and coordinated multi-load switching and is studied with a variety of switching signals. Numerical results show the potential and characteristics of the proposed switching exploitation when applied to the four-machine two-area power system and the Northeast Power Coordinating Council 68-bus system.},

abstract={Modern power grids are increasingly relying on real-time data, such as those from phasor measurement units (PMUs), for their control and management operations. Due to its dependence on the Internet for data transfer, the grid is susceptible to a wide range of cyber-attacks. Among these, data manipulation attacks are of particular interest in the context of PMU data, due to their potential for causing widespread damage. In such attacks, the adversary changes the measurements in order to bias the estimate of system states. In this paper, we propose an effective and simple-to-implement mechanism for detecting such attacks. The proposed methodology is based on evaluating the equivalent impedances of transmission lines. Being independent of the conventional bad data detection scheme, it is also able to detect the so called “false data injection attacks.” Extensive simulation results using real PMU data have been provided in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed detector.},

year={2017},

pages={17742-17752},
abstract={The arms race between the distributors of malware and those seeking to provide defenses has so far favored the former. Signature detection methods have been unable to cope with the onslaught of new binaries aided by rapidly developing obfuscation techniques. Recent research has focused on the analysis of low-level opcodes, both static and dynamic, as a way to detect malware. Although sometimes successful at detecting malware, static analysis still fails to unravel obfuscated code, whereas dynamic analysis can allow researchers to investigate the revealed code at runtime. Research in the field has been limited by the underpinning data sets; old and inadequately sampled malware can lessen the extrapolation potential of such data sets. The main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new parsed runtime trace data set of over 100 000 labeled samples, which will address these shortcomings, and we offer the data set itself for use by the wider research community. This data set underpins the examination of the run traces using classifiers on count-based and sequence-based data. We find that malware detection rates are lessened when samples are labeled with traditional anti-virus (AV) labels. Neither count-based nor sequence-based algorithms can sufficiently distinguish between AV label classes. Detection increases when malware is re-classed with labels yielded from unsupervised learning. With sequenced-based learning, detection exceeds that of labeling as simply “malware”alone. This approach may yield future work, where the triaging of malware can be more effective.},

abstract={With the rapid increase in Internet services, network traffic data has become very large and complex, increasing the possibility of intrusions. The traditional intrusion detection system (IDS) cannot detect intrusion behaviors among such high-speed traffic data. A real-time network IDS should be able to process large amounts of network traffic data as quickly as possible to detect malicious traffic as early as possible. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a network intrusion detection framework based on a distributed random forest capable of handling high-speed traffic data. This framework consists of three parts: a data capturing part based on NetFlow, a preprocessing data part and a classification-based intrusion detection part. In this paper, we apply the random forest classification algorithm and adapt it to the Apache Spark distributed processing system to realize real-time detection. To verify the effectiveness of the framework, we implement the system and perform several comparison experiments. The results show that the system has satisfactory efficiency and accuracy compared to existing systems and thus is very suitable for the real-time detection of network intrusion, with a large capacity and high speed.},

abstract={Malware evolves rapidly over time, which makes existing solutions being ineffective in detecting newly released malware. Machine learning models that can learn to capture malicious patterns directly from the data play an increasingly important role in malware analysis. However, traditional machine learning models heavily depend on feature engineering. The extracted static features are vulnerable as hackers could create new malware with different feature values to deceive the machine learning models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end malware detection framework consisting of convolutional neural network, autoencoder and neural decision trees. It learns the features from multiple domains for malware detection without feature engineering. In addition, since anti-virus products should have a very low false alarm rate to avoid annoying users, we propose a special loss function, which optimizes the recall for a fixed low false positive rate (e.g., less than 0.1%). Experiments show that the proposed framework has achieved a better recall than the baseline models, and the derived loss function also makes a difference.},

Specifically, we reconstruct adversarial examples according to their cluster assignments in pixel level to reduce the impact of the injected perturbation. Our approach does not rely on any neural network architectures and can also work with existing pre-processing defenses to provide better protection for modern classifiers. Comprehensive comparison and evaluation have been conducted to investigate our proposal, where the models protected by the proposed defense show substantial robustness to strong adversarial attacks. As a by-product of our exploration of ensemble defense, we identify that the order of defense methods has a crucial impact on the final performance. Additionally, the limitation of K-means reconstruction and the impact of the number of clusters have also been studied to provide an in-deep understanding of pre-processing defenses.},

abstract={Machine learning has been widely applied to building security applications. However, many machine learning models require the continuous supply of representative labeled data for training, which limits the models' usefulness in practice. In this paper, we use bot detection as an example to explore the use of data synthesis to address this problem. We collected the network traffic from 3 online services in three different months within a year (23 million network requests). We develop a stream-based feature encoding scheme to support machine learning models for detecting advanced bots. The key novelty is that our model detects bots with extremely limited labeled data. We propose a data synthesis method to synthesize unseen (or future) bot behavior distributions. The synthesis method is distribution-aware, using two different generators in a Generative Adversarial Network to synthesize data for the clustered regions and the outlier regions in the feature space. We evaluate this idea and show our method can train a model that outperforms existing methods with only 1% of the labeled data. We show that data synthesis also improves the model's sustainability over time and speeds up the retraining. Finally, we compare data synthesis and adversarial retraining and show they can work complementary with each other to improve the model generalizability.},

abstract={Federated Learning is the current state-of-the-art in supporting secure multi-party machine learning (ML): data is maintained on the owner's device and the updates to the model are aggregated through a secure protocol. However, this process assumes a trusted centralized infrastructure for coordination, and clients must trust that the central service does not use the byproducts of client data. In addition to this, a group of malicious clients could also harm the performance of the model by carrying out a poisoning attack. As a response, we propose Biscotti: a fully decentralized peer to peer (P2P) approach to multi-party ML, which uses blockchain and cryptographic primitives to coordinate a privacy-preserving ML process between peering clients. Our evaluation demonstrates that Biscotti is scalable, fault tolerant, and defends against known attacks. For example, Biscotti is able to both protect the privacy of an individual client's update and maintain the performance of the global model at scale when 30 percent adversaries are present in the system.},

abstract={Principal component analysis (PCA) is an ubiquitous data compression and feature extraction technique in signal processing and machine learning. As compared with the classical L2-norm PCA, its L1-norm version offers increased robustness to outliers that are usually present in faulty data. Recently, L1-PCA was shown to perform source recovery when the observed data follow an independent component analysis (ICA) model. However, proof of this result requires the data to be sphered, i.e., to be preprocessed to constrain their covariance matrix to be the identity. The present contribution extends this result by relaxing the sphering assumption and allowing the data to have arbitrary covariance matrix. We prove that L1-PCA is indeed able to identify the mixing matrix columns associated with the strongest independent sources, thus performing signal subspace identification with improved robustness to outliers. Numerical experiments illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.},

abstract={In recent years, the application of smartphones, Android operating systems and mobile applications have become more prevalent worldwide. To study the traceability, propagation, and detection of the threats, we perform research on all aspects of the end-to-end environment. With machine learning based on the mobile malware detection algorithms that integrate the dynamic and static research of the identification algorithm, application software samples are collected to study sentences. Through knowledge labeling and knowledge construction, the association relationship of knowledge is extracted to realize the research of knowledge map construction. Flooding is closely correlated with the complexity of the Android mobile version of the kernel and malicious programs. A static dynamic analysis of the mobile malicious program is carried out, and the social network social diagram is constructed to model the propagation of the mobile malicious program. We extended the approach of deriving common malware behavior through graph clustering. On this basis, Android behavior analysis is performed through our virtual machine execution engine. We extend the family characteristics to the concept of DNA race genes. By studying SMS/MMS, Bluetooth, 5G base station networks, metropolitan area networks, social networks, homogeneous communities, telecommunication networks, and application market ecosystem propagation scenarios, we discovered the law of propagation. In addition, we studied the construction of the mobile Internet big data knowledge graph. Quantitative data for the main family chronology of mobile malware are obtained. We conducted detailed research and comprehensive analysis of Android application package (APK) details and behavior, relationship, resource-centric, and syntactic aspects. Furthermore, we summarized the architecture of mobile malware security analysis. We also discuss encryption of malware traffic discrimination. These precise modeling and quantified research results constitute the architecture of mobile malware analysis.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks which can hide backdoor triggers in DNNs by poisoning training data. A backdoored model behaves normally on clean test images, yet consistently predicts a particular target class for any test examples that contain the trigger pattern. As such, backdoor attacks are hard to detect, and have raised severe security concerns in real-world applications. Thus far, backdoor research has mostly been conducted in the image domain with image classification models. In this paper, we show that existing image backdoor attacks are far less effective on videos, and outline 4 strict conditions where existing attacks are likely to fail: 1) scenarios with more input dimensions (eg. videos), 2) scenarios with high resolution, 3) scenarios with a large number of classes and few examples per class (a ``sparse dataset"), and 4) attacks with access to correct labels (eg. clean-label attacks). We propose the use of a universal adversarial trigger as the backdoor trigger to attack video recognition models, a situation where backdoor attacks are likely to be challenged by the above 4 strict conditions. We show on benchmark video datasets that our proposed backdoor attack can manipulate state-of-the-art video models with high success rates by poisoning only a small proportion of training data (without changing the labels). We also show that our proposed backdoor attack is resistant to state-of-the-art backdoor defense/detection methods, and can even be applied to improve image backdoor attacks. Our proposed video backdoor attack not only serves as a strong baseline for improving the robustness of video models, but also provides a new perspective for more understanding more powerful backdoor attacks.},

Also, we present a zero false alarms framework which can find vulnerability instances precisely and generate test cases and triggers to validate the findings, by combing static analysis and dynamic binary instrumentation techniques. We implement our method in a tool named Witness, which currently can detect 8 different types of vulnerabilities and is extensible to support more. Evaluated on 3211 popular apps, Witness successfully detected 243 vulnerability instances, with better precision and more proofs than four existing tools.},

abstract={Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools provide visibility into sophisticated intrusions by matching system events against known adversarial behaviors. However, current solutions suffer from three challenges: 1) EDR tools generate a high volume of false alarms, creating backlogs of investigation tasks for analysts; 2) determining the veracity of these threat alerts requires tedious manual labor due to the overwhelming amount of low-level system logs, creating a "needle-in-a-haystack" problem; and 3) due to the tremendous resource burden of log retention, in practice the system logs describing long-lived attack campaigns are often deleted before an investigation is ever initiated.This paper describes an effort to bring the benefits of data provenance to commercial EDR tools. We introduce the notion of Tactical Provenance Graphs (TPGs) that, rather than encoding low-level system event dependencies, reason about causal dependencies between EDR-generated threat alerts. TPGs provide compact visualization of multi-stage attacks to analysts, accelerating investigation. To address EDR's false alarm problem, we introduce a threat scoring methodology that assesses risk based on the temporal ordering between individual threat alerts present in the TPG. In contrast to the retention of unwieldy system logs, we maintain a minimally-sufficient skeleton graph that can provide linkability between existing and future threat alerts. We evaluate our system, RapSheet, using the Symantec EDR tool in an enterprise environment. Results show that our approach can rank truly malicious TPGs higher than false alarm TPGs. Moreover, our skeleton graph reduces the long-term burden of log retention by up to 87%.},

abstract={The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating Voice/Video over IP sessions. While deployed globally to facilitate multimedia communications, SIP is subject to various attacks. The defense against SIP attacks, however, often lack expertise due to the limited resources within the organization. When there is a large footprint of SIP systems, scaling and keeping up SIP defense becomes crucial in safeguarding these systems. This paper proposes SIPchain, a distributed SIP defense cluster system that leverages Blockchain technology as a distributed, highly-available, and permanent ledger of Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Each node in this cluster is a sensor and shares attack intelligence with other nodes via Blockchain. Each node reads information from the Blockchain and implements the appropriate firewall rule based on this information. This approach scales the defense because each node can leverage the actionable intelligence provided by other nodes and does not have to perform detection on their own. Experiments have been performed using a cluster of three SIP nodes in three different countries (US, UK, and Singapore) and the Ethereum Blockchain network. The result shows that when a node detected an attack, it produced and stored the IOC information at the Ethererum. Fellow SIP nodes retrieved this information, implemented firewall rule based on this information, and were proactively prepared when the same attack was launched against them. This SIPchain approach scales the SIP defense effort by utilizing Blockchain technology to secure the ever-growing footprint of SIP systems within the organization.},

abstract={Several wired and wireless advanced communication technologies have been used for coordinated voltage regulation schemes in distribution systems. These technologies have been employed to both receive voltage measurements from field sensors and transmit control settings to voltage regulating devices (VRDs). Communication networks for voltage regulation can be susceptible to data falsification attacks, which can lead to voltage instability. In this context, an attacker can alter multiple field measurements in a coordinated manner to disturb voltage control algorithms. This paper proposes a machine learning-based two-stage approach to detect, locate, and distinguish coordinated data falsification attacks on control systems of coordinated voltage regulation schemes in distribution systems with distributed generators. In the first stage (regression), historical voltage measurements along with current meteorological data (solar irradiance and ambient temperature) are provided to random forest regressor to forecast voltage magnitudes of a given current state. In the second stage, a logistic regression compares the forecasted voltage with the measured voltage (used to set VRDs) to detect, locate, and distinguish coordinated data falsification attacks in real-time. The proposed approach is validated through several case studies on a 240-node real distribution system (based in the USA) and the standard IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution system. The results show that the proposed approach can detect low margin attacks (as low as 1% of actual measurements) with up to 99% accuracy. All of the developed source codes of the proposed solution are publicly available at Github. https://github.com/nbhusal/Data-Attack-on-Voltage-Regulation.},

abstract={Honeypots are powerful security tools, developed to shield commercial and industrial networks from malicious activity. Honeypots act as passive and interactive decoys in a network attracting malicious activity and securing the rest of the network entities. Since an increase in intrusions has been observed lately, more advanced security systems are necessary. In this paper a new method of adapting a honeypot system in a modern industrial network, employing the Modbus protocol, is introduced. In the presented NeuralPot honeypot, two distinct deep neural network implementations are utilized to adapt to network Modbus entities and clone them, actively confusing the intruders. The proposed deep neural networks and their generated data are then compared.},

abstract={In wireless sensor network (WSN) transmission of data securely is a critical issue. Clustering is powerful and feasible way to improve performance of the WSN system. We study transmission of data securely for clustered WSNs (CWSNs). We use two Secure and Efficient data Transmission (SET) protocols for CWSNs called SET-IBS and SET-IBOOS. SET-IBS uses the Identity-Based digital Signature (IBS) scheme and SET-IBOOS uses Identity-Based Online/Offline digital Signature (IBOOS) scheme. In SET-IBS security depends on the hardness of Diffie-Hellman problem in the pairing region. SET-IBOOS diminishes the operating cost of computation for protocol security, which is important for WSN, while its defense depends on durability of problem of discrete logarithm. Cluster head selection and clustering are important in WSN to route data efficiently. Multi Weight Based Clustering Algorithm (MWBCA) is an extended LEACH where cluster head is elected on weight given to each sensor node. We used Multi Weight Based Clustering Algorithm (MWBCA) for Cluster Head selection, then aggregate data at cluster head and going to provide security using Identity based Digital Signature.},

abstract={Over the last years, natural disasters have shown to impair and destroy communication infrastructure. This results in an increased importance of infrastructure-independent ad hoc communication systems, such as delay-tolerant networks (DTNs). Research has shown that these networks are able to provide basic communication functionality for civilians. However, they are limited in their performance as the network topology is highly intermittent due to the human nature of clustering around important locations like shelters and moving in groups. Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be efficient data ferries between clusters due to their high mobility. This requires up-to-date knowledge about cluster locations to determine UAV flight paths. However, the shortest paths usually do not cover disconnected network nodes in transit between clusters, that will miss critical messages like evacuation notices or hazard warnings. This paper provides two contributions for UAV-assisted post-disaster DTN communication. First, we present a novel approach to estimate dynamically changing cluster locations in a post-disaster scenario. Second, we introduce a topology-aware path planning approach for UAV data ferry flights, covering in-transit nodes in-between clusters. Our evaluation highlights the requirements on network topology knowledge for an efficient application of UAV data ferries. We furthermore demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of disconnected in-transit nodes, which is especially important in the considered post-disaster scenario.},

abstract={Speaker verification has been widely and successfully adopted in many mission-critical areas for user identification. The training of speaker verification requires a large amount of data, therefore users usually need to adopt third-party data (e.g., data from the Internet or third-party data company). This raises the question of whether adopting untrusted third-party data can pose a security threat. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to inject the hidden backdoor for infecting speaker verification models by poisoning the training data. Specifically, we design a clustering-based attack scheme where poisoned samples from different clusters will contain different triggers (i.e., pre-defined utterances), based on our understanding of verification tasks. The infected models behave normally on benign samples, while attacker-specified unenrolled triggers will successfully pass the verification even if the attacker has no information about the enrolled speaker. We also demonstrate that existing back-door attacks cannot be directly adopted in attacking speaker verification. Our approach not only provides a new perspective for designing novel attacks, but also serves as a strong baseline for improving the robustness of verification methods. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/zhaitongqing233/Backdoor-attack-against-speaker-verification.},

abstract={Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are commonly used by botnets to generate domain names that bots can use to establish communication channels with their command and control servers. Recent publications presented deep learning classifiers that detect algorithmically generated domain (AGD) names in real time with high accuracy and thus significantly reduce the effectiveness of DGAs for botnet communication. In this paper, we present MaskDGA, an evasion technique that uses adversarial learning to modify AGD names in order to evade inline DGA classifiers, without the need for the attacker to possess any knowledge about the DGA classifier's architecture or parameters. MaskDGA was evaluated on four state-of-the-art DGA classifiers and outperformed the recently proposed CharBot and DeepDGA evasion techniques. We also evaluated MaskDGA on enhanced versions of the same classifiers equipped with common adversarial defenses (distillation and adversarial retraining). While the results show that adversarial retraining has some limited effectiveness against the evasion technique, it is clear that a more resilient detection mechanism is required. We also propose an extension to MaskDGA that allows an attacker to omit a subset of the modified AGD names based on the classification results of the attacker's trained model, in order to achieve a desired evasion rate.},

abstract={Despite the ubiquitous role of domain name system (DNS) in sustaining the operations of various Internet services (domain name to IP address resolution, e-mail, Web), DNS was abused/misused to perform large-scale attacks that affected millions of Internet users. To detect and prevent threats associated to DNS, researchers introduced passive DNS replication and analysis as an effective alternative approach for analyzing live DNS traffic. In this paper, we survey state of the art systems that utilized passive DNS traffic for the purpose of detecting malicious behaviors on the Internet. We highlight the main strengths and weaknesses of the implemented systems through an in-depth analysis of the detection approach, collected data, and detection outcomes. We highlight an incremental implementation pattern in the studied systems with similarities in terms of the used datasets and detection approach. Furthermore, we show that almost all studied systems implemented supervised machine learning, which has its own limitations. In addition, while all surveyed systems required several hours or even days before detecting threats, we illustrate the ability to enhance performance by implementing a system prototype that utilizes big data analytics frameworks to detect threats in near real-time. We demonstrate the feasibility of our threat detection prototype through real-life examples, and provide further insights for future work toward analyzing DNS traffic in near real-time.},

abstract={With current IoT architectures, once a single device in a network is compromised, it can be used to disrupt the behavior of other devices on the same network. Even though system administrators can secure critical devices in the network using best practices and state-of-the-art technology, a single vulnerable device can undermine the security of the entire network. The goal of this work is to limit the ability of an attacker to exploit a vulnerable device on an IoT network and fabricate deceitful messages to co-opt other devices. The approach is to limit attackers by using device proxies that are used to retransmit and control network communications. We present an architecture that prevents deceitful messages generated by compromised devices from affecting the rest of the network. The design assumes a centralized and trustworthy machine that can observe the behavior of all devices on the network. The central machine collects application layer data, as opposed to low-level network traffic, from each IoT device. The collected data is used to train models that capture the normal behavior of each individual IoT device. The normal behavioral data is then used to monitor the IoT devices and detect anomalous behavior. This paper reports on our experiments using both a binary classifier and a density-based clustering algorithm to model benign IoT device behavior with a realistic test-bed, designed to capture normal behavior in an IoT-monitored environment. Results from the IoT testbed show that both the classifier and the clustering algorithms are promising and encourage the use of application-level data for detecting compromised IoT devices.},

abstract={Host-based anomaly intrusion detection system design is very challenging due to the notoriously high false alarm rate. This paper introduces a new host-based anomaly intrusion detection methodology using discontiguous system call patterns, in an attempt to increase detection rates whilst reducing false alarm rates. The key concept is to apply a semantic structure to kernel level system calls in order to reflect intrinsic activities hidden in high-level programming languages, which can help understand program anomaly behaviour. Excellent results were demonstrated using a variety of decision engines, evaluating the KDD98 and UNM data sets, and a new, modern data set. The ADFA Linux data set was created as part of this research using a modern operating system and contemporary hacking methods, and is now publicly available. Furthermore, the new semantic method possesses an inherent resilience to mimicry attacks, and demonstrated a high level of portability between different operating system versions.},

abstract={Deep neural networks(DNNs) are widely used in AI-controlled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to controll cars, robotics, water treatment plants and railways. However, DNNs have vulnerabilities to well-designed input samples that are called adversarial examples. Adversary attack is one of the important techniques for detecting and improving the security of neural networks. Existing attacks, including state-of-the-art black-box attack have a lower success rate and make invalid queries that are not beneficial to obtain the direction of generating adversarial examples. For these reasons, this paper proposed a CMA-ES-based adversarial attack on black-box DNNs. Firstly, an efficient method to reduce the number of invalid queries is introduced. Secondly, a black-box attack of generating adversarial examples to fit a high-dimensional independent Gaussian distribution of the local solution space is proposed. Finally, a new CMA-based perturbation compression method is applied to make the process of reducing perturbation smoother. Experimental results on ImageNet classifiers show that the proposed attack has a higher success-rate than the state-of-the-art black-box attack but reduce the number of queries by 30% equally.},

In this paper, we propose an adversarial ML attack using generative adversarial networks (GANs) that can successfully evade an ML-based IDS. We also show that GANs can be used to inoculate the IDS and make it more robust to adversarial perturbations.},

abstract={This paper studies model-inversion attacks, in which the access to a model is abused to infer information about the training data. Since its first introduction by~\cite{fredrikson2014privacy}, such attacks have raised serious concerns given that training data usually contain privacy sensitive information. Thus far, successful model-inversion attacks have only been demonstrated on simple models, such as linear regression and logistic regression. Previous attempts to invert neural networks, even the ones with simple architectures, have failed to produce convincing results. Here we present a novel attack method, termed the \emph{generative model-inversion attack}, which can invert deep neural networks with high success rates. Rather than reconstructing private training data from scratch, we leverage partial public information, which can be very generic, to learn a distributional prior via generative adversarial networks (GANs) and use it to guide the inversion process. Moreover, we theoretically prove that a model's predictive power and its vulnerability to inversion attacks are indeed two sides of the same coin---highly predictive models are able to establish a strong correlation between features and labels, which coincides exactly with what an adversary exploits to mount the attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attack improves identification accuracy over the existing work by about $75\%$ for reconstructing face images from a state-of-the-art face recognition classifier. We also show that differential privacy, in its canonical form, is of little avail to defend against our attacks.},

abstract={We present effective off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks, circumventing widely-deployed challenge-response defenses, e.g., transaction identifier randomisation, port and query randomisation. Our attacks depend on the use of UDP to retrieve long DNS responses, resulting in IP fragmentation. We show how attackers are often able to generate such fragmented responses, and then abuse them to inject spoofed, 'poisonous' records, into legitimate DNS responses. We also studied how resolvers, name servers, domains and registrars, can defend against our attacks. The best defense is deployment and enforcement of DNSSEC validation. However, DNSSEC must be deployed correctly by both domain and resolver, which is challenging; we hope our results will catalyse this process, but it will surely take long time. In fact, recent study found less than 1 % of resolvers reject responses upon DNSSEC validation failures. Note also that, ironically, adoption of DNSSEC by a domain, is the main reason for fragmented DNS responses (abused in our attacks). We therefore present several short-term countermeasures, which can complement DNSSEC, especially until DNSSEC deployment is complete. We validated our attacks against popular resolvers (Bind and Unbound), and real domains in the Internet.},

abstract={Federated learning is proposed as an approach that enables several participants to collaboratively train the machine learning model, but without directly expose the local data to others. Although federated learning is developed to prevent the participants' local sensitive data leakage. However, recent researches show that federated learning systems are still faced with privacy and security challenges. In the privacy view, if participants or the central server are curious, they can inference information about the training data or the model by the exchanged update parameters. From a security perspective, the malicious participants can make poisoning attacks during the model training phase. Differential privacy and security multiparty computation (SMC) is exploited to solve the privacy problem. But they often result in large communication overhead or low federated learning accuracy. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive scheme that has effects on both privacy and security issues. In this article, we proposed a homomorphic encryption-based privacy enhancement mechanism which has effectiveness on membership inference attacks. Our method works in two phases. In phase I, our method exploits homomorphic encryption to encrypts participants' update parameters before sending out to the aggregator. In phase II, we add a parameter selection method to the aggregator of the federated learning system to choose participants' updated information with a certain probability. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively defends both against membership inference attacks and poisoning attacks and makes less model accuracy effects than other existing solutions.},

abstract={In recent times, ransomware has become the most significant cyber-attack targeting individuals, enterprises, healthcare industries, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Existing security systems like Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) and Anti-virus (AV) as a single monitoring agent is complicated and time-consuming, thus fails in ransomware detection. A robust Intrusion Detection Honeypot (IDH) is proposed to address the issues mentioned above. IDH consists of i) Honeyfolder, ii) Audit Watch, and iii) Complex Event Processing (CEP). Honeyfolder is a decoy folder modeled using Social Leopard Algorithm (SoLA), especially for getting attacked and acting as an early warning system to alert the user during the suspicious file activities. AuditWatch is an Entropy module that verifies the entropy of the files and folders. CEP engine is used to aggregate data from different security systems to confirm the ransomware behavior, attack pattern, and promptly respond to them. The proposed IDH is experimentally tested in a secured testbed using more than 20 variants of recent ransomware of all types. The experimental result confirms that the proposed IDH significantly improves the ransomware detection time, rate, and accuracy compared with the existing state of the art ransomware detection model.},

abstract={Energy disaggregation, namely the separation of the aggregated household energy consumption signal into its additive sub-components, bears resemblance to the signal (source) separation problem and poses several challenges, not only as an ill-posed problem, but also, due to unsteady appliance signatures, abnormal behaviour that is usually detected in appliances operation and the existence of noise in the aggregated signal. In this paper, we propose EnerGAN++, a model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for robust energy disaggregation. We attempt to unify the autoencoder (AE) and GAN architectures into a single framework, in which the autoencoder achieves a non-linear power signal source separation. EnerGAN++ is trained adversarially using a novel discriminator, to enhance robustness to noise. The discriminator performs sequence classification, using a recurrent convolutional neural network to handle the temporal dynamics of an appliance energy consumption time series. In particular, the proposed architecture of the discriminator leverages the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in rapid processing and optimal feature extraction, among with the need to infer the data temporal character and time dependence. Experimental results indicate the proposed method's superiority compared to the current state of the art.},

abstract={Real-time object detection is one of the key applications of deep neural networks (DNNs) for real-world mission-critical systems. While DNN-powered object detection systems celebrate many life-enriching opportunities, they also open doors for misuse and abuse. This paper presents a suite of adversarial objectness gradient attacks, coined as TOG, which can cause the state-of-the-art deep object detection networks to suffer from untargeted random attacks or even targeted attacks with three types of specificity: (1) object-vanishing, (2) object-fabrication, and (3) object-mislabeling. Apart from tailoring an adversarial perturbation for each input image, we further demonstrate TOG as a universal attack, which trains a single adversarial perturbation that can be generalized to effectively craft an unseen input with a negligible attack time cost. Also, we apply TOG as an adversarial patch attack, a form of physical attacks, showing its ability to optimize a visually confined patch filled with malicious patterns, deceiving well-trained object detectors to misbehave purposefully. We report our experimental measurements using three benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and INRIA) on models from three dominant detection algorithms (YOLOv3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN). The results demonstrate serious adversarial vulnerabilities and the compelling need for developing robust object detection systems. The source code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/TOG.},

abstract={A fully integrated system for the automatic detection and characterization of cracks in road flexible pavement surfaces, which does not require manually labeled samples, is proposed to minimize the human subjectivity resulting from traditional visual surveys. The first task addressed, i.e., crack detection, is based on a learning from samples paradigm, where a subset of the available image database is automatically selected and used for unsupervised training of the system. The system classifies nonoverlapping image blocks as either containing crack pixels or not. The second task deals with crack type characterization, for which another classification system is constructed, to characterize the detected cracks' connect components. Cracks are labeled according to the types defined in the Portuguese Distress Catalog, with each different crack present in a given image receiving the appropriate label. Moreover, a novel methodology for the assignment of crack severity levels is introduced, computing an estimate for the width of each detected crack. Experimental crack detection and characterization results are presented based on images captured during a visual road pavement surface survey over Portuguese roads, with promising results. This is shown by the quantitative evaluation methodology introduced for the evaluation of this type of system, including a comparison with human experts' manual labeling results.},

abstract={Nowadays, network technologies are essential for transferring and storing various information of users, companies, and industries. However, the growth of the information transfer rate expands the attack surface, offering a rich environment to intruders. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widespread systems able to passively or actively control intrusive activities in a defined host and network perimeter. Recently, different IDSs have been proposed by integrating various detection techniques, generic or adapted to a specific domain and to the nature of attacks operating on. The cybersecurity landscape deals with tremendous diverse event streams that exponentially increase the attack vectors. Event stream processing (ESP) methods appear to be solutions that leverage event streams to provide actionable insights and faster detection. In this paper, we briefly describe domains (as well as their vulnerabilities) on which recent papers were-based. We also survey standards for vulnerability assessment and attack classification. Afterwards, we carry out a classification of IDSs, evaluation metrics, and datasets. Next, we provide the technical details and an evaluation of the most recent work on IDS techniques and ESP approaches covering different dimensions (axes): domains, architectures, and local communication technologies. Finally, we discuss challenges and strategies to improve IDS in terms of accuracy, performance, and robustness.},

abstract={XSS is one of the common vulnerabilities in web applications. Many black-box testing tools may collect a large number of payloads and traverse them to find a payload that can be successfully injected, but they are not very efficient. And previous research has paid less attention to how to improve the efficiency of black-box testing to detect XSS vulnerability. To improve the efficiency of testing, we develop an XSS testing tool. It collects 6128 payloads and uses a headless browser to detect XSS vulnerability. The tool can discover XSS vulnerability quickly with the ART(Adaptive Random Testing) method. We conduct an experiment using 3 extensively adopted open source vulnerable benchmarks and 2 actual websites to evaluate the ART method. The experimental results indicate that the ART method can effectively improve the fuzzing method by more than 27.1% in reducing the number of attempts before accomplishing a successful injection.},

abstract={The rhetoric over the rate with which state-sponsored or state-endorsed cyber attacks has grown dramatically in the past years. Increasing dependence on information communication technologies by both state and non-state actors; compounded further by the low-cost of entry and the challenge of attribution within the cyber domain have all but assured that this phenomenon would continue in the foreseeable future. While there is no shortage of literature that discusses the benefits and ease with which these events occur within this domain, their dynamics have yet to be studied through the lens of cyber power. Through the analysis of state cyber power vis-a-vis historical cyber conflicts between states, the study identifies cyber strategies that states may use against each other. The findings provided by this study may go on to aid in establishing appropriate controls to not only mitigate the possible impact of future cyber conflicts but may also lead to the creation of effective deterrence mechanisms.},

abstract={Third-party libraries (TPLs) as essential parts in the mobile ecosystem have become one of the most significant contributors to the huge success of Android, which facilitate the fast development of Android applications. Detecting TPLs in Android apps is also important for downstream tasks, such as malware and repackaged apps identification. To identify in-app TPLs, we need to solve several challenges, such as TPL dependency, code obfuscation, precise version representation. Unfortunately, existing TPL detection tools have been proved that they have not solved these challenges very well, let alone specify the exact TPL versions. To this end, we propose a system, named ATVHunter, which can pinpoint the precise vulnerable in-app TPL versions and provide detailed information about the vulnerabilities and TPLs. We propose a two-phase detection approach to identify specific TPL versions. Specifically, we extract the Control Flow Graphs as the coarse-grained feature to match potential TPLs in the pre-defined TPL database, and then extract opcode in each basic block of CFG as the fine-grained feature to identify the exact TPL versions. We build a comprehensive TPL database (189,545 unique TPLs with 3,006,676 versions) as the reference database. Meanwhile, to identify the vulnerable in-app TPL versions, we also construct a comprehensive and known vulnerable TPL database containing 1,180 CVEs and 224 security bugs. Experimental results show AtVHunter outperforms state-of-the-art TPL detection tools, achieving 90.55% precision and 88.79% recall with high efficiency, and is also resilient to widely-used obfuscation techniques and scalable for large-scale TPL detection. Furthermore, to investigate the ecosystem of the vulnerable TPLs used by apps, we exploit newtool to conduct a large-scale analysis on 104,446 apps and find that 9,050 apps include vulnerable TPL versions with 53,337 vulnerabilities and 7,480 security bugs, most of which are with high risks and are not recognized by app developers.},

We also demonstrate the practical applicability of the cross-domain security analysis framework using the cyber-physical manufacturing system as a case study.},

abstract={In this paper, a machine learning based decision support system for a naval shipboard power management system is proposed considering contingencies and load priority. A probabilistic model based Bayes' classifier is implemented to classify the current operation state of the ShipBoard Power System (SPS), depending upon the power system readiness for critical contingencies. Real power, reactive power, and generator status are taken as input features for the algorithm. Loss of vital/non-vital load is calculated by solving optimal power flow (OPF) to help build the knowledge base. Training data are updated online to increase the accuracy of the proposed approach. The characterization of the operation states helps the shipboard power management system to take the appropriate control action. Initial results from tests are presented and the outcomes from the particular techniques are discussed. Moreover, we also present RTDS based experimental framework towards the ongoing research on overall management system including the diagnosis support. Naïve Bayes' approach has classified the system states with 97.67% accuracy to new instances. Preliminary results show the computation time of this approach is in the order of 25 ms.},

abstract={Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled a paradigm shift to include machine intelligence in a wide range of autonomous tasks. As a result, a largely unexplored surface has opened up for attacks jeopardizing the integrity of DL models and hindering the success of autonomous systems. To enable ubiquitous deployment of DL approaches across various intelligent applications, we propose to develop architectural support for hardware implementation of secure and robust DL. Towards this goal, we leverage hardware/software co-design to develop a DL execution engine that supports algorithms specifically designed to defend against various attacks. The proposed framework is enhanced with two real-time defense mechanisms, securing both DL training and execution stages. In particular, we enable model-level Trojan detection to mitigate backdoor attacks and malicious behaviors induced on the DL model during training. We further realize real-time adversarial attack detection to avert malicious behavior during execution. The proposed execution engine is equipped with hardware-level IP protection and usage control mechanism to attest the legitimacy of the DL model mapped to the device. Our design is modular and can be tuned to task-specific demands, e.g., power, throughput, and memory bandwidth, by means of a customized hardware compiler. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce the nonrecurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various domains and applications.},

abstract={Intrusion is a series of activities that violate an organisation's existing security goals and procedures. Hence, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should be capable of analysing incoming network traffic (packet) and determining if it is an attack or otherwise. Lack of recent and up to date data sets for the training of IDS is a critical issue in the development of effective IDS. This paper focuses on creating a more realistic data set in our case UMaT-OD-20 using ONDaSCA and also the building a Multi-layer Stack Ensemble (MLS) IDS Model for Intrusion Detection Systems. Multi-layer Stacked Ensemble exploits the strengths of various base-level model predictions to build a more robust meta-classifier that meliorate classification accuracy and reduces False Alarm Rate (FAR). Five (5) Supervised Machine Learning (ML) based algorithms videlicet K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes' (NB) were employed to generate predictive models for all features. The Python programming language was used for the entire research and all programming and evaluation of data was done with an Inter Core i7, 16GB RAM and 1TB HDD Windows 10 Pro Laptop computer. The predictions of the Multi-layer stacked ensemble showed an improvement of 0.97% over the best base model. This improvement reduced the FAR during the classification of network connections types. Again, the evaluation of our work shows a significant improvement over similar works in literature.},

The trend toward operating the grid over IP networks using open standard protocols, and the growing number of attacks targeting critical infrastructure made the security of SCADA systems an important research issue. Most of the currently used SCADA communication protocols have no encryption, authentication, or authorization, which makes them vulnerable and easy target for cyber-attacks. This paper presents an Autonomic Critical Infrastructure Protection (ACIP) system that is based on anomaly-based intrusion detection and autonomic computing to secure the control functions and management tasks of critical infrastructure control systems with a little or no involvement from the users or administrators. We will show how we applied ACIP to the widely used Modbus communication protocol to securely transfer commands and data between RTUs and industrial control systems in smart grids.},

abstract={Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, specifically supervised learning, are widely used in modern real-world applications, which utilize Computational Intelligence (CI) as their core technology, such as autonomous vehicles, assistive robots, and biometric systems. Attacks that cause misclassifications or mispredictions can lead to erroneous decisions resulting in unreliable operations. Designing robust ML with the ability to provide reliable results in the presence of such attacks has become a top priority in the field of adversarial machine learning. An essential characteristic for rapid development of robust ML is an arms race between attack and defense strategists. However, an important prerequisite for the arms race is access to a well-defined system model so that experiments can be repeated by independent researchers. This article proposes a fine-grained system-driven taxonomy to specify ML applications and adversarial system models in an unambiguous manner such that independent researchers can replicate experiments and escalate the arms race to develop more evolved and robust ML applications. The article provides taxonomies for: 1) the dataset, 2) the ML architecture, 3) the adversary's knowledge, capability, and goal, 4) adversary's strategy, and 5) the defense response. In addition, the relationships among these models and taxonomies are analyzed by proposing an adversarial machine learning cycle. The provided models and taxonomies are merged to form a comprehensive system-driven taxonomy, which represents the arms race between the ML applications and adversaries in recent years. The taxonomies encode best practices in the field and help evaluate and compare the contributions of research works and reveals gaps in the field.},

pages={2430-2444},
abstract={Federated learning has emerged as an advanced privacy-preserving learning technique for mobile edge computing, where the model is trained in a decentralized manner by the clients, preventing the server from directly accessing those private data from the clients. This learning mechanism significantly challenges the attack from the server side. Although the state-of-the-art attacking techniques that incorporated the advance of Generative adversarial networks (GANs) could construct class representatives of the global data distribution among all clients, it is still challenging to distinguishably attack a specific client (i.e., user-level privacy leakage), which is a stronger privacy threat to precisely recover the private data from a specific client. To analyze the privacy leakage of federated learning, this paper gives the first attempt to explore user-level privacy leakage by the attack from a malicious server. We propose a framework incorporating GAN with a multi-task discriminator, called multi-task GAN - Auxiliary Identification (mGAN-AI), which simultaneously discriminates category, reality, and client identity of input samples. The novel discrimination on client identity enables the generator to recover user specified private data. Unlike existing works interfering the federated learning process, the proposed method works “invisibly” on the server side. Furthermore, considering the anonymization strategy for mitigating mGAN-AI, we propose a beforehand linkability attack which re-identifies the anonymized updates by associating the client representatives. A novel siamese network fusing the identification and verification models is developed for measuring the similarity of representatives. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and the superior to the state-of-the-art.},

pages={225356-225369},
abstract={Much compelling evidence urges that the isolation provided by the hypervisor in a virtualized system is not complete at all, and in practice can be neutralized by elaborated adversaries, which consequently emphasizes the need of techniques to detect attacks on the guest VM kernels. In this regard, learning-based HIDSs have received much attention, which inspect the internals of each VM through monitoring models built by machine learning techniques. The inspection capability of learning-based HIDSs depends on the quality of the monitoring models, which in turn can be improved by using rich runtime information reflecting the exact behavior of VMs. However, as extracting such runtime behavior information is onerous on account of its vast quantity, many learning-based HIDSs have resorted to using only fragmentary runtime behavior information. To address this problem, in this paper, we present SBGen, a framework for efficient extraction of rich runtime behavior information of VMs, namely the system call traces and the execution paths of the kernel taken to serve system calls. To trace execution of the kernel efficiently, SBGen leverages a salient hardware feature, Intel Processor Trace (PT). Once receiving the execution of the kernel traces from PT, SBGen elaborately decodes and purifies them to extract execution paths of the kernel associated with system calls. The extracted runtime behavior information of VMs is fed into learning-based HIDSs to improve their detection accuracy. Our experiments show that SBGen can extract and supply runtime behavior information efficiently enough for learning-based HIDSs to detect in a timely fashion real-world attacks on the guest VM kernels running in a virtualized system, while incurring a reasonable amount of performance overhead.},

abstract={Insider attack detection in an enterprise network environment is a critical problem that currently has no promising solution. It represents a significant challenge since host availability and performance requirements cannot be ignored. A network based approach allows these requirements to be met but is limited by the granularity of data available and the near impossibility of defining exact signatures for known attack types. Anomaly detection approaches suffer from the well known problem of false positives making them hard to apply in enterprise environments where even a moderate false positive rate is not acceptable. Sophisticated attacks and complex network topologies make it hard to apply simplistic approaches to anomaly detection. This paper presents an approach that applies the unsupervised learning techniques of bi-clustering and one-class SVM to so-called weak indicators of network attacks. This approach is well suited for network flow data that is coarse grained and not amenable to simplistic anomaly detection or signature-based techniques. Further, our approach allows a security analyst to determine the cause of the anomaly, a capability that is typically not supportable by simplistic applications of unsupervised learning.},

As part of proactive defense, researchers are proactively identifying such vulnerabilities so that protective measures could be developed subsequently. This research explores a novel blackbox trojanising approach using a simple network structure modification to any deep learning image classification model that would transform a benign model into a deviant one with a simple manipulation of the weights to induce specific types of errors. Propositions to protect the occurrence of such simple exploits are discussed in this research.

In particular, the state-of-the-art salient object detection methods enjoy high accuracy and efficiency from fully convolutional network (FCN)-based frameworks which are trained from end to end and predict pixel-wise labels. However, such framework suffers from adversarial attacks which confuse neural networks via adding quasi-imperceptible noises to input images without changing the ground truth annotated by human subjects. To our knowledge, this paper is the first one that mounts successful adversarial attacks on salient object detection models and verifies that adversarial samples are effective on a wide range of existing methods. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable framework to enhance the robustness for arbitrary FCN-based salient object detection models against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework adopts a novel idea that first introduces some new generic noise to destroy adversarial perturbations, and then learns to predict saliency maps for input images with the introduced noise. Specifically, our proposed method consists of a segment-wise shielding component, which preserves boundaries and destroys delicate adversarial noise patterns and a context-aware restoration component, which refines saliency maps through global contrast modeling. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework improves the performance significantly for state-of-the-art models on a series of datasets.},

abstract={While deep learning in 3D domain has achieved revolutionary performance in many tasks, the robustness of these models has not been sufficiently studied or explored. Regarding the 3D adversarial samples, most existing works focus on manipulation of local points, which may fail to invoke the global geometry properties, like robustness under linear projection that preserves the Euclidean distance, i.e., isometry. In this work, we show that existing state-of-the-art deep 3D models are extremely vulnerable to isometry transformations. Armed with the Thompson Sampling, we develop a black-box attack with success rate over 95% on ModelNet40 data set. Incorporating with the Restricted Isometry Property, we propose a novel framework of white-box attack on top of spectral norm based perturbation. In contrast to previous works, our adversarial samples are experimentally shown to be strongly transferable. Evaluated on a sequence of prevailing 3D models, our white-box attack achieves success rates from 98.88% to 100%. It maintains a successful attack rate over 95% even within an imperceptible rotation range [±2.81°].},

abstract={Establishing long-view situation awareness of threat agents requires an operational capability that scales to large volumes of network data, leveraging the past to make-sense of the present and to anticipate the future. Yet, today we are dominated by short-view capabilities driven by misuse based strategies; triggered by the structural qualities of attack vectors. The structural aspects of cyber threats are in a constant flux, rendering most defensive technologies reactive to previously unknown attack vectors. Unlike structural signature based approaches, both the real-time and aggregate behaviors exhibited by cyber threats over a network provide insight into making-sense of anomalies found on our networks. In this work, we explore the challenges posed in identifying and developing a set of behavior primitives that facilitate the creation of threat narratives use to describe cyber threats anomalies. Thus, we investigate the use aggregate behaviors derived from network flow data establishing initial behavior models used to detect complex cyber threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Our cyber data fusion prototype employs a unique layered methodology that extracts features from network flow data aggregating it by time. This approach is more scalable and flexible in its application in large network data volumes. The preliminary evaluation of the proposed methodology and supporting models shows some promising results.},

pages={2452-2465},
abstract={Machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations: small changes to input that can cause large changes in output. It is also demonstrated that there exist input-agnostic perturbations, called universal adversarial perturbations, which can change the inference of target model on most of the data samples. However, existing methods to craft universal perturbations are (i) task specific, (ii) require samples from the training data distribution, and (iii) perform complex optimizations. Additionally, because of the data dependence, fooling ability of the crafted perturbations is proportional to the available training data. In this paper, we present a novel, generalizable and data-free approach for crafting universal adversarial perturbations. Independent of the underlying task, our objective achieves fooling via corrupting the extracted features at multiple layers. Therefore, the proposed objective is generalizable to craft image-agnostic perturbations across multiple vision tasks such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario (when the attacker does not have access to the target model and it's training data), we show that our objective outperforms the data dependent objectives to fool the learned models. Further, via exploiting simple priors related to the data distribution, our objective remarkably boosts the fooling ability of the crafted perturbations. Significant fooling rates achieved by our objective emphasize that the current deep learning models are now at an increased risk, since our objective generalizes across multiple tasks without the requirement of training data for crafting the perturbations. To encourage reproducible research, we have released the codes for our proposed algorithm1.},

abstract={Manual inspection and harvesting of ripening tomatoes is time consuming and labor intensive. Smart agriculture can emphasize the use of digital horticultural resources for farming and can increase farm sustainability; to that end, we proposed a fuzzy Mask R-CNN model to automatically identify the ripeness levels of cherry tomatoes. First, to annotate the images automatically, a fuzzy c-means model was used to maintain the spatial information of various foreground and background elements of the image. Then, a Hough transform method was applied to locate the specific geometric edge positions of the tomatoes. Each data point of the image space was annotated to a JavaScript Object Notation file. Second, annotated images were trained with Mask R-CNN to identify each tomato precisely. Finally, to prevent preharvest abscission of tomatoes, a hue-saturation-value color model and fuzzy inference rules were used to predict the ripeness of the tomatoes. A trigonometric function with Euclidian distance was calculated from the origin of calyx and stem to the bottom of the tomato to obtain the position of the pedicle head and dissect the fruit in a timely manner. For detection of 100 tomato images, Mask R-CNN achieved an accuracy of 98.00%. The ripeness classification of tomatoes achieved overall weighted precision and recall rates of 0.9614 and 0.9591, respectively. Thus, automatic tomato harvesting applications can empower farmers to make better decisions and enhance overall production efficiency and yield.},

abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used in variety of fields with great success. However, recent researches indicate that DNNs are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can easily fool the well-trained DNNs without being detected by human eyes. In this paper, we propose to combine the target DNN model with robust bit plane classifiers to defend against adversarial attacks. It comes from our finding that successful attacks generate imperceptible perturbations, which mainly affects the low-order bits of pixel value in clean images. Hence, using bit planes instead of traditional RGB channels for convolution can effectively reduce channel modification rate. We conduct experiments on dataset CIFAR-10 and GTSRB. The results show that our defense method can effectively increase the model accuracy on average from 8.72% to 85.99% under attacks on CIFAR-10 without sacrificina accuracy of clean images.},

While a traditional cross-site scripting vulnerability exploits server-side codes, DOM-based XSS is a type of vulnerability which affects the script code being executed in the clients browser. DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities are much harder to be detected than classic XSS vulnerabilities because they reside on the script codes from Web sites. An automated scanner needs to be able to execute the script code without errors and to monitor the execution of this code to detect such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a distributed scanning tool for crawling modern Web applications on a large scale and detecting, validating DOMbased XSS vulnerabilities.

abstract={With the striking development of big data, individual privacy and data security obtain unprecedented importance. Database anonymization mechanism is created for protecting individual privacy by adding noise to the result of a query, which finds a tradeoff between the privacy and utility of personal data. However, corresponding attacks are emerging continuously resulting in a high risk of individual identification. In this paper, we learn patterns of malicious SQL queries and propose a novel detection method. Association rules are used to mine patterns and features of noise-exploitation attacks, and parse trees are applied to the feature extraction of SQL, thereby we construct feature vectors and input them into the classifiers. At the same time, we also propose a SQL generation method to generate query samples based on a real database for model training and testing. Experiments show that our detection method can significantly prevent noise-exploitation attacks including almost all differential attacks and 91% cloning attacks based on the synthetic dataset, which ensures a strong degree of data utility.},

abstract={Security for cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS), which are expected to contribute to realizing a safe and efficient transportation environment, will become more important in the near future. Among various proposed C-ITS services, this study examines security measures against cyber attacks for navigation services that collect sensor data from vehicles to estimate real-time traffic and distribute trip planning and route selection. In such services, a threat is assumed in which a malicious attacker prevents the traffic condition from being correctly recognized by injecting false data. As a result of such attacks, the services may fail to decide appropriate routes, and there is a concern that this cyber attack will likely disrupt traffic in the real world. By using a simulator on the basis of actual traffic data, we experimentally clarify that false data injection attacks against C-ITS services cause artificial congestion. Due to the potential for serious consequences of traffic disruption, security countermeasure technology is vital. To respond to cyber attacks that use false sensor data, technology to analyze sensor data and detect abnormalities is required. For this reason, we propose an analysis technique that efficiently analyzes sensor data transmitted from a huge number of vehicles to identify an attacker. The idea of the proposed method is to narrow down the sensor data for detailed analysis by screening on the basis of simple statistical analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed method can efficiently detect false data injection attacks against C-ITS navigation services.},

abstract={It has been recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) will play an important role in future societies. AI has already been incorporated in many industries to improve business processes and automation. Although the aviation industry has successfully implemented flight management systems or autopilot to automate flight operations, it is expected that full embracement of AI remains a challenge. Given the rigorous validation process and the requirements for the highest level of safety standards and risk management, AI needs to prove itself being safe to operate. This paper addresses the safety issues of AI deployment in an aviation network compatible with the Future Communication Infrastructure that utilizes heterogeneous wireless access technologies for communications between the aircraft and the ground networks. It further considers the exploitation of software defined networking (SDN) technologies in the ground network while the adoption of SDN in the airborne network can be optional. Due to the nature of centralized management in SDN-based network, the SDN controller can become a single point of failure or a target for cyber attacks. To countermeasure such attacks, an intrusion detection system utilises AI techniques, more specifically deep neural network (DNN), is considered. However, an adversary can target the AI-based intrusion detection system. This paper examines the impact of AI security attacks on the performance of the DNN algorithm. Poisoning attacks targeting the DSL-KDD datasets which were used to train the DNN algorithm were launched at the intrusion detection system. Results showed that the performance of the DNN algorithm has been significantly degraded in terms of the mean square error, accuracy rate, precision rate and the recall rate.},

However, adaptation in-and-of-itself offers a side channel by which malicious entities can extract valuable information. An attacker can take advantage of autonomic resource management techniques to fool a system into misallocating resources and crippling applications. Using a few scenarios, we outline how attacks can be launched using partial knowledge of the resource management substrate - with as little as a single compromised node. We argue that any system that provides adaptation must consider resource management as an attack surface. As such, we propose ADAPT2, a framework that incorporates concepts taken from Moving-Target Defense and state estimation techniques to ensure correctness and obfuscate resource management, thereby protecting valuable system and application information from leaking.},

abstract={Humans assimilate information from the traffic environment mainly through visual perception. Obviously, the dominant information required to conduct a vehicle can be acquired with visual sensors. However, in contrast to most other sensor principles, video signals contain relevant information in a highly indirect manner and hence visual sensing requires sophisticated machine vision and image understanding techniques. This paper provides an overview on the state of research in the field of machine vision for intelligent vehicles. The functional spectrum addressed covers the range from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving. The organization of the article adopts the typical order in image processing pipelines that successively condense the rich information and vast amount of data in video sequences. Data-intensive low-level “early vision” techniques first extract features that are later grouped and further processed to obtain information of direct relevance for vehicle guidance. Recognition and classification schemes allow to identify specific objects in a traffic scene. Recently, semantic labeling techniques using convolutional neural networks have achieved impressive results in this field. High-level decisions of intelligent vehicles are often influenced by map data. The emerging role of machine vision in the mapping and localization process is illustrated at the example of autonomous driving. Scene representation methods are discussed that organize the information from all sensors and data sources and thus build the interface between perception and planning. Recently, vision benchmarks have been tailored to various tasks in traffic scene perception that provide a metric for the rich diversity of machine vision methods. Finally, the paper addresses computing architectures suited to real-time implementation. Throughout the paper, numerous specific examples and real world experiments with prototype vehicles are presented.},

A key requirement for the widespread deployment of mobile robots is the ability to operate autonomously by learning desired environmental models and revising the learned models in response to environmental changes. This paper presents an approach that enables a mobile robot to autonomously learn layered models for environmental objects using temporal, local and global visual cues. A temporal assessment of image gradient features is used to detect candidate objects, which are then modeled using color distribution statistics and a spatial representation of gradient features. The robot incrementally revises the learned models and uses them for object recognition and tracking based on a matching scheme comprising a spatial similarity measure and second order distribution statistics. All algorithms are implemented and tested on a wheeled robot platform in dynamic indoor environments.},

abstract={Confidentiality of training data induced by releasing machine-learning models, and has recently received increasing attention. Motivated by existing MI attacks and other previous attacks that turn out to be MI "in disguise," this paper initiates a formal study of MI attacks by presenting a game-based methodology. Our methodology uncovers a number of subtle issues, and devising a rigorous game-based definition, analogous to those in cryptography, is an interesting avenue for future work. We describe methodologies for two types of attacks. The first is for black-box attacks, which consider an adversary who infers sensitive values with only oracle access to a model. The second methodology targets the white-box scenario where an adversary has some additional knowledge about the structure of a model. For the restricted class of Boolean models and black-box attacks, we characterize model invertibility using the concept of influence from Boolean analysis in the noiseless case, and connect model invertibility with stable influence in the noisy case. Interestingly, we also discovered an intriguing phenomenon, which we call "invertibility interference," where a highly invertible model quickly becomes highly non-invertible by adding little noise. For the white-box case, we consider a common phenomenon in machine-learning models where the model is a sequential composition of several sub-models. We show, quantitatively, that even very restricted communication between layers could leak a significant amount of information. Perhaps more importantly, our study also unveils unexpected computational power of these restricted communication channels, which, to the best of our knowledge, were not previously known.},

Images are encoded into discriminative and unique regular expression descriptors in such a way that can be used for classification purposes. The regular expression descriptors are streamed through sets of non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). Results show that image retrieval can be implemented on automata structures that can achieve dramatic improvement over general purpose processors or graphics processors in efficiency.},

abstract={The direction of sunlight is an important informative cue in a number of applications in image processing, such as augmented reality and object recognition. In general, existing methods to estimate the direction of the sunlight rely on different image features (e.g., sky, texture, shadows, and shading). These features can be considered as weak informative cues as no single feature can reliably estimate the sunlight direction. Moreover, existing methods may require that the camera parameters are known limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a new method to estimate the sunlight direction from a single (outdoor) image by inferring casts shadows through object modeling and recognition. First, objects (e.g., cars or persons) are first (automatically) recognized in images by exemplar-SVMs. Instead of training the Support Vector Machine (SVMs) using natural images (limited variation in viewpoints), we propose to train on 2D object samples generated from 3D object models. Then, the recognized objects are used as sundial cues (probes) to estimate the sunlight direction by inferring the corresponding shadows generated by 3D object models considering different illumination directions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and real images. Experiments show that our method estimates the azimuth angle accurately within a quadrant (smaller than 45°) and compute the zenith angle with mean angular error of 23°.},

abstract={In recent years, the research community has increasingly focused on understanding the security and privacy challenges posed by deep learning models. However, the security domain and the privacy domain have typically been considered separately. It is thus unclear whether the defense methods in one domain will have any unexpected impact on the other domain. In this paper, we take a step towards enhancing our understanding of deep learning models when the two domains are combined together. We do this by measuring the success of membership inference attacks against two state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods that mitigate evasion attacks: adversarial training and provable defense. On the one hand, membership inference attacks aim to infer an individual's participation in the target model's training dataset and are known to be correlated with target model's overfitting. On the other hand, adversarial defense methods aim to enhance the robustness of target models by ensuring that model predictions are unchanged for a small area around each sample in the training dataset. Intuitively, adversarial defenses may rely more on the training dataset and be more vulnerable to membership inference attacks. By performing empirical membership inference attacks on both adversarially robust models and corresponding undefended models, we find that the adversarial training method is indeed more susceptible to membership inference attacks, and the privacy leakage is directly correlated with model robustness. We also find that the provable defense approach does not lead to enhanced success of membership inference attacks. However, this is achieved by significantly sacrificing the accuracy of the model on benign data points, indicating that privacy, security, and prediction accuracy are not jointly achieved in these two approaches.},

abstract={Permission systems are the main defense that mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, offer to users to protect their private data from prying apps. However, due to the tension between usability and control, such systems have several limitations that often force users to overshare sensitive data. We address some of these limitations with SmarPer, an advanced permission mechanism for Android. To address the rigidity of current permission systems and their poor matching of users' privacy preferences, SmarPer relies on contextual information and machine learning methods to predict permission decisions at runtime. Note that the goal of SmarPer is to mimic the users' decisions, not to make privacy-preserving decisions per se. Using our SmarPer implementation, we collected 8,521 runtime permission decisions from 41 participants in real conditions. With this unique data set, we show that using an efficient Bayesian linear regression model results in a mean correct classification rate of 80% (±3%). This represents a mean relative reduction of approximately 50% in the number of incorrect decisions when compared with a user-defined static permission policy, i.e., the model used in current permission systems. SmarPer also focuses on the suboptimal trade-off between privacy and utility, instead of only "allow" or "deny" type of decisions, SmarPer also offers an "obfuscate" option where users can still obtain utility by revealing partial information to apps. We implemented obfuscation techniques in SmarPer for different data types and evaluated them during our data collection campaign. Our results show that 73% of the participants found obfuscation useful and it accounted for almost a third of the total number of decisions. In short, we are the first to show, using a large dataset of real in situ permission decisions, that it is possible to learn users' unique decision patterns at runtime using contextual information while supporting data obfuscation, this is an important step towards automating the management of permissions in smartphones.},

In this paper, we model and assess the security and capacity oriented availability of multiple server redundancy designs when applying security patches to the servers. We construct (1) a graphical security model to evaluate the security under potential attacks before and after applying patches, (2) a stochastic reward net model to assess the capacity oriented availability of the system with a patch schedule. We present our approach based on case study and model-based evaluation for multiple design choices. The results show redundancy designs increase capacity oriented availability but decrease security when applying security patches. We define functions that compare values of security metrics and capacity oriented availability with the chosen upper/lower bounds to find design choices that satisfy both security and availability requirements.},

abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence(AI), unmanned vehicles can relieve traffic jamming and decrease the risk of traffic accidents, where deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role and have become one of the most critical technologies. Nevertheless, DNNs are still susceptible to adversarial examples. Even worse, they also show severe performance degradation when the system needs DNNs to learn new knowledge without forgetting the old one. As unmanned vehicles travel on the road, they need to frequently learn new categories and different representations. Learning all data after the new sample arrives will expend a lot of time and space. As a result, it will affect the deployment of artificial intelligence in unmanned scenes. In recent years, it has been observed that incremental learning technology can solve the above challenges. However, previously reported works mainly focused on batch learning. It is not clear how much impact the adversarial attack will have on the deep learning model when performing incremental learning tasks. This issue exposes the hidden safety risks of unmanned driving and increases discuss opportunities. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques for unmanned scenes in this paper. Specifically, it can retain information previously learned by the model. At the same time, it can renew the old model to learn new model, thereby continually adding small perturbation to legitimate examples. A couple of experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has been conducted, and the experiment results show that the adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques has a higher attack success rate. Further, it can improve the successful attack rate by 8.43%.},

abstract={Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to their application in security sensitive systems. We propose high-level representation guided denoiser (HGD) as a defense for image classification. Standard denoiser suffers from the error amplification effect, in which small residual adversarial noise is progressively amplified and leads to wrong classifications. HGD overcomes this problem by using a loss function defined as the difference between the target model's outputs activated by the clean image and denoised image. Compared with ensemble adversarial training which is the state-of-the-art defending method on large images, HGD has three advantages. First, with HGD as a defense, the target model is more robust to either white-box or black-box adversarial attacks. Second, HGD can be trained on a small subset of the images and generalizes well to other images and unseen classes. Third, HGD can be transferred to defend models other than the one guiding it. In NIPS competition on defense against adversarial attacks, our HGD solution won the first place and outperformed other models by a large margin.},

abstract={Visual odometry has been promoted as a fundamental component for intelligent vehicles. Relying solely on monocular image cues would be desirable. Nevertheless, this is a challenge especially in dynamically varying urban areas due to scale ambiguities, independent motions, and measurement noise. We propose to use probabilistic learning with auxiliar depth cues. Specifically, we developed an expert model that specializes monocular egomotion estimation units on typical scene structures, i.e. statistical variations of scene depth layouts. The framework adaptively selects the best fitting expert. For on-line estimation of egomotion, we adopted a probabilistic subspace flow estimation method. Learning in our framework consists of two components: 1) Partitioning of datasets of video and ground truth odometry data based on unsupervised clustering of dense stereo depth profiles and 2) training a cascade of subspace flow expert models. A probabilistic quality measure from the estimates of the experts provides a selection rule overall leading to improvements of egomotion estimation for long test sequences.},

We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial "machine learning as a service" providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies.},

In this work, EtherCAT based anomaly detection is studied applying machine learning methods. To do this, first, a water level control testbed is developed in laboratory scale. Attack vectors are created, and a dataset is formed considering EtherCAT communication principles. Secondly, attributes related to the running-process are selected and reduced. Finally, anomalies are detected both for supervised and unsupervised methods and an evaluation of the methods are done. Results showed that, SVM and Random Forest can be used for EtherCAT anomaly detection as supervised methods. It is also observed that each algorithm applied in unsupervised learning is successful in detecting a specific attack trace.},

abstract={Highly available cloud storage is often implemented with complex, multi-tiered distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity servers and disk drives. Storage reliability, security and performance are among the top desired features when clients consider storing data on cloud storage. Although replication improves reliability and performance in cloud storage systems, data replication increases the risk of data storage in an insecure network environment. When a cloud storage scales up, storage nodes are very likely to become heterogeneous in nature. In this study, we propose a secure replica allocation scheme called SecRA to improve security, reliability, and performance of a cloud storage system where storage nodes have a wide variety of vulnerabilities. Our SecRA integrates the techniques of replication and fragmentation with secret sharing in a heterogeneous cloud system, where storage nodes are comprised of various server types in terms of vulnerability characteristics. SecRA allocates data replicas of fragments of a file to as many different types of nodes as possible. For the replicas of the same fragment, SecRA tries to allocate these replicas to the same type of nodes in the system. Data assurance is significantly improved, because the replicas of different fragments of a file are allocated to multiple types of storage nodes. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of security offered by SecRA, we develop a storage assurance model. Our analytically results show that replica allocations made by SecRA lead to enhanced security thanks to the consideration of heterogeneous vulnerabilities in cloud storage systems.},

With theoretically unbounded resources a determined attacker is able to recover any confidential keys and data. A strong whitebox cipher implementation as the cornerstone of security is essential for the overall security in mobile environments. Our goal is to provide an increased degree of protection given the constraints of a software solution and the resource constrained, hostile-host environments.

abstract={Concerns regarding the scalability of the interdomain routing have encouraged researchers to start elaborating a more robust Internet architecture. While consensus on the exact form of the solution is yet to be found, the need for a semantic decoupling of a node's location and identity is generally accepted as a promising way forward. However, this typically requires the use of caches that store temporal bindings between the two namespaces, to avoid hampering router packet forwarding speeds. In this article, we propose a methodology for an analytical analysis of cache performance that relies on the working-set theory. We first identify the conditions that network traffic must comply with for the theory to be applicable and then develop a model that predicts average cache miss rates relying on easily measurable traffic parameters. We validate the result by emulation, using real packet traces collected at the egress points of a campus and an academic network. To prove its versatility, we extend the model to consider cache polluting user traffic and observe that simple, low intensity attacks drastically reduce performance, whereby manufacturers should either overprovision router memory or implement more complex cache eviction policies.},

abstract={The insider threat is one of the most serious security problems faced by modern organizations. High pro?le cases demonstrate the serious consequences of successful attacks. The problem has been studied for many years, leading to a number of technologies and products that have been deployed widely in government and commercial enterprises. A fundamental question is: how well do these systems work? How may they be tested? How expensive are widely deployed monitoring infrastructures in terms of computational cost? Measurement of real systems, which are dynamic in nature, encounter unknown con?guration bugs and have sensitivities to the vagaries of human nature and adversarial behavior, requires a formal means to continuously test and evaluate deployed detection systems. We present a framework to deploy in situ simulated user bots (SUBs) that can emulate the actions of real users. By creating a user account and by running a host in the enterprise network, a SUB can be introduced into an enterprise system that runs at a realistic pace and does not interfere with normal operations. Infusing malicious behavior into the SUB should be detected by the insider threat monitoring infrastructure. The SUB framework can be controlled to explore the limits of deployed systems and to test the effectiveness of insider evasion tactics, especially low and slow behaviors. We demonstrate our framework in a synthetic ecosystem as well as in a live enterprise deployment. We created a synthetic environment of users based on data collected in a West Point cadet study. Various machine learning based intrusion detection algorithms are used to validate the ability of the SUB framework to generate both normal and malicious users. In a live University network, we launched a number of attacks on its intrusion detection system and showcased the ability to devise malicious users. In addition, we further deployed low and slow attacks that perform malicious actions over an extended period of time and demonstrate how even a large enterprise is ill equipped to combat such attacks.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) has gained popularity in network intrusion detection, due to its strong capability of recognizing subtle differences between normal and malicious network activities. Although a variety of methods have been designed to leverage DL models for security protection, whether these systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) is unknown. In this article, we design a novel adversarial attack against DL-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in the Internet-of-Things environment, with only black-box accesses to the DL model in such NIDS. We introduce two techniques: 1) model extraction is adopted to replicate the black-box model with a small amount of training data and 2) a saliency map is then used to disclose the impact of each packet attribute on the detection results, and the most critical features. This enables us to efficiently generate AEs using conventional methods. With these tehniques, we successfully compromise one state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune: the adversary only needs to modify less than 0.005% of bytes in the malicious packets to achieve an average 94.31% attack success rate.},

abstract={Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that decouples the control plane and the data plane to provide unprecedented programmability, automation, and network control. The SDN controller exercises centralized control over network software, and in doing so, it can monitor and respond to malicious traffic for network protection. This paper proposes a threat-aware system based on machine-learning for timely detection and response against network intrusion in SDN. Our proposed system consists of data preprocessing for feature selection, predictive data modeling for machine-learning and anomaly detection, and decision making for intrusion response in SDN. Due to the time-critical nature of SDN, we propose a practical approach utilizing machine-learning techniques to protect against network intrusion and reduce uncertainty in decision-making outcomes. The maliciousness of most uncertain network traffic subsets is evaluated with selected significant feature sets. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves high performance and significantly reduces uncertainty in the decision process with a small number of feature sets. The results help the SDN controller to properly react against known or unknown attacks that cannot be prevented by signature-based network intrusion detection systems.},

abstract={Visual odometry (VO) is one of the essential techniques in mobile robots field; an accurate VO system is of great significance for mobile robot simultaneous localization and mapping. As for traditional monocular VO systems, they work by presuming the monocular scale is 1 (scale = 1), or relying on ground truth (GT) to estimate scale. As a result, the traditional monocular VO systems estimate the pose state with big drift or cannot work on the image sequence without GT. Although some classical monocular VO systems have been proposed, they still have imperfect performance or even unable to work in some extreme scene conditions, such as scene is monotony without obvious texture information or camera large-scale displacement motion. As for learning-based VO system, it is realized by training deep neural networks in supervised or self-supervised manner to end-to-end estimate the pose state; however, the accuracy of pose estimation entirely depends on the ability of networks. Although the ability of networks can be improved by increasing the number of training data sets and optimizing the network structure, it is inevitable to encounter problems such as insufficient generalization ability and insufficient accuracy on rotational pose estimation. In this article, a monocular VO system named DL_Hybrid is proposed, which takes full advantage of DL networks used in image processing and geometric localization theory based on hybrid pose estimation methods. The DL_Hybrid VO system can estimate a six-DoF pose one-frame-by-one-frame and recover camera trajectory, and it can extract accurate key points from per-frame even in extreme scene condition, and it has good performance even in the extreme moving condition, such as camera rotation-only action or static action, also it can work well in the condition of camera large-scale displacement motion. The real scale is also accurately estimated without depending on GT, and the pose estimation method is designed based on hybrid 2d-2d and 3d-2d localization theory to make the DL_Hyrid VO system to estimate translational and rotational information with accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed DL_Hybrid VO system has a better performance than traditional and learning-based VO systems.},

abstract={In recent years, deep learning models have been widely adopted for transfer learning tasks. The deep models, however, were shown to be easily attacked by adversarial examples, which is generated from original samples with the carefully designed small perturbations. Thus, the transfer learning models based on deep networks will also face this problem. Because of the particularity of transfer learning tasks, using the conventional adversarial training to improve the robustness of deep transfer models is very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel Double Transfer Learning with Adversarial Training (DTLAT) method to enhance the robustness of deep transfer learning models. Our intuition is using the instances of the source domain and target domain to help with adversarial training. At the same time, we design a reverse transfer learning method to weaken the effect of attack methods and improve the performance of deep transfer models of target domain. We regard the adversarial examples from some kind of attack method, like FGSM, as an adversarial domain while try to improve the generalization ability on other attacks method. Experiments demonstrate that DTLAT exceed many other methods about improving the robustness of the deep transfer model on several benchmark datasets.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) requires the integration of all available, highly specialized, and heterogeneous devices, ranging from embedded sensor nodes to servers in the cloud. The self-adaptive research domain provides adaptive capabilities that can support the integration in IoT systems. However, developing such systems is a challenging, error-prone, and time-consuming task. In this context, design patterns propose already used and optimized solutions to specific problems in various contexts. Applying design patterns might help to reuse existing knowledge about similar development issues. However, so far, there is a lack of taxonomies on design patterns for self-adaptive systems. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we provide a taxonomy on design patterns for self-adaptive systems that can be transferred to support adaptivity in IoT systems. Besides describing the taxonomy and the design patterns, we discuss their applicability in an Industrial IoT case study.},

Therefore, the research on cyber-security and prevention of cyber-attacks, including intrusion detection as an effective means of defense against cyber-attacks, is warranted. Both in the research and in the development of the systems for intrusion detection, the machine learning and deep learning methods are widely utilized, and the NSL-KDD dataset is frequently used in algorithm research and verification. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage dimensionality reduction (TSDR) feature selection method and verified by NSL-KDD dataset. The method reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and significantly improves the calculation efficiency. The KNN algorithm is used to verify that the new feature selection method improves the calculation efficiency. The accuracy rate is only slightly reduced when compared to the full feature calculation.},

abstract={Communications security is a critical and increasingly challenging issue in wireless networks. A well-known approach for achieving information-theoretic secrecy relies on deploying artificial noises to blind the intruders' interception in the physical layer. However, this approach requires a static channel condition for the transmitter and receiver to generate and offset the controllable artificial noise, which can hardly be implemented in real wireless environments. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of symbol obfuscation to defend against the passive eavesdropping attack and fake packet injection attack during the wireless communications. We propose a multiple inter-symbol obfuscation (MIO) scheme, which utilizes a set of artificial noisy symbols (symbols key) to obfuscate the original data symbols in the physical layer. MIO can effectively enhance the wireless communications security. On the one hand, an eavesdropper, without knowing the artificial noisy symbols, cannot correctly decrypt the obfuscated symbols from the eavesdropped packets. On the other hand, a legitimate receiver can easily check the integrity of the symbols key and then reject the fake packets from the received packets. The security analysis reveals that, without considering the initial key, the MIO scheme can achieve information-theoretic secrecy against the passive eavesdropping attack and computational secrecy against the fake packet injection attack. Moreover, we have implemented our approach in a USRP2 testbed and conducted simulations with Simulink tools to validate the effectiveness of MIO in enhancing wireless communications security.},

We analyze the interactions between the attackers and the defenders, and derive optimal strategies for both sides. We further prove the existence of several Bayesian-Nash equilibriums in the honeypot game. Finally, we evaluate our proposals on an AMI testbed in the smart grid, and the results show that our proposed strategy is effective in improving the efficiency of defense with the deployment of honeypots.},

In this paper, we present a concept for identifying agents with exploitation strategies that works on a system-wide analysis of trust and work relationships. Afterwards, we introduce a system-wide control loop to isolate these malicious elements using a norm-based approach - due to the agents' autonomy, we have to build on indirect control actions. Within simulations of a Desktop Computing Grid scenario, we show that the intelligent control loop works highly successful: these malicious elements are identified and isolated with a low error rate. We further demonstrate that the approach results in a significant increase of utility for all participating benevolent agents.},

abstract={Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack is an side-channel attack which aims at encrypted web traffic. WF attackers recognize encrypted website traffic through constructing fingerprinting for each website using the flow-based features extracted from encrypted traffic. WF defense typically aims at modifying the features of the encrypted websites. However, those countermeasures either cause high overhead or fail to counter the subsequent WF attacks. Especially, the newest WF attacks, which are based on deep neural network, is able to classify the defended traffic by directly learning from the labeled defended traffic. In this paper, we propose an novel defense through making use of the trick that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial exmaples. We design WF-GAN, a GAN with an additional WF classifier component, to generate adversarial examples for WF classifiers through adversarial learning. As the website set is divided into source and target website, WF-GAN are trained to map websites features from source set to adversarial examples and make adversarial examples more similar to the website features in the target set. The experimental result shows that WF-GAN achieves 90% success rate with at most 15% overhead for untargeted defense, which outperforms previous defense. In addition, adversarial examples based defense support targeted defense, which is not support by traditional defense. The result shows that WF-GAN achieves over 90% targeted defense success rate when the target websites set is twice as many as the source website set.},

Various attack methods against DNNs have been proposed, yet there still lacks theoretical explanation of adversarial examples. In this paper, we aim to understand adversarial examples from the attacking process and we assume adding perturbations to the key/sensitive regions of the image could fool image classification DNNs. We propose gradient shielding to verify the assumption which ignores insensitive information during generating adversarial examples. Specifically, we propose interactive gradient shielding (IGS) method which selects sensitive regions and then applies gradient-based attack. To remove region selection, we propose adaptive gradient shielding (AGS) method which ignores insensitive gradients automatically. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and the results also corroborate our perspective. With this method, we won the first place in IJCAI-AAAC 2019 Non-targeted Adversarial Attack competition.},

pages={2187-2202},
abstract={The randomization methods that are applied for privacy-preserving data mining are commonly subject to reconstruction, linkage, and semantic-related attacks. Some existing works employed random noise addition to realize probabilistic anonymity, aiming only at linkage attacks. Random noise addition is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, and is unable to achieve semantic closeness, particularly on high-dimensional data, to prevent semantic-related attacks. For linkage attacks, the main security vulnerability of their proposed probabilistic anonymity lies in the assumption that the attacker had a priori knowledge of the quasi-identifiers of all individuals. When only some individuals leak their quasi-identifiers, the proposed model will become incapable, because the attacker can deploy a different linkage attack that has not been studied before. This type of attack is much easier to deploy and is thus very harmful. In this paper, we propose new frameworks of probabilistic (1, k)and (k, k)-anonymity to defend against all these linkage attacks, and realize the frameworks on a hybrid randomization model. The model is also secure against reconstruction attacks. We further achieve statistical semantic closeness of high-dimensional data to prevent semantic-related attacks on the model. The frameworks also allow us to re-design the traditional K-nearest neighbor algorithm to leverage the introduced data uncertainty and improve the mining results. This paper demonstrates the promising applications in large-scale and high-dimensional data mining in clouds, by providing high efficiency and security to protect data privacy, guaranteeing high data utility for mining purposes, on-time processing, and non-interactive data publishing.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) and 4G/5G wireless networks have added huge number of devices and new services, where commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) IoT devices have been deployed extensively. To ensure secure operations of these systems with wireless transmission capabilities, Radio Frequency (RF) surveillance is important to monitor their activities in RF spectrum and detect unauthorized IoT devices. Specifically, in order to prevent an adversary from impersonating legitimate users using identical devices from the same manufacturer, unique “signatures” must be obtained for every individual device in order to uniquely identify each device. In this study, a novel intrusion detection method is proposed to detect unauthorized IoT devices using deep learning. The proposed method is based on RF fingerprinting since physical layer based features are device specific and more difficult to impersonate. RF traces are collected from six “identical” ZigBee devices via a USRP based test bed. The traces span a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio, to ensure robustness of the model. A convolutional neural network is used to extract features from the RF traces, and dimension reduction and de-correlation are performed on the extracted features. The reduced features are then clustered to identify IoT devices. We show that the proposed method is able to identify devices that are not observed during training. The results not only highlight the benefit of deep learning based feature extraction, but also show promising prospects for being able to distinguish new devices (classes) that are not observed during training.},

abstract={Today's cities generate tremendous amounts of data, thanks to a boom in affordable smart devices and sensors. The resulting big data creates opportunities to develop diverse sets of context-aware services and systems, ensuring smart city services are optimized to the dynamic city environment. Critical resources in these smart cities will be more rapidly deployed to regions in need, and those regions predicted to have an imminent or prospective need. For example, crime data analytics may be used to optimize the distribution of police, medical, and emergency services. However, as smart city services become dependent on data, they also become susceptible to disruptions in data streams, such as data loss due to signal quality reduction or due to power loss during data collection. This paper presents a dynamic network model for improving service resilience to data loss. The network model identifies statistically significant shared temporal trends across multivariate spatiotemporal data streams and utilizes these trends to improve data prediction performance in the case of data loss. Dynamics also allow the system to respond to changes in the data streams such as the loss or addition of new information flows. The network model is demonstrated by city-based crime rates reported in Montgomery County, MD, USA. A resilient network is developed utilizing shared temporal trends between cities to provide improved crime rate prediction and robustness to data loss, compared with the use of single city-based auto-regression. A maximum improvement in performance of 7.8 % for Silver Spring is found and an average improvement of 5.6 % among cities with high crime rates. The model also correctly identifies all the optimal network connections, according to prediction error minimization. City-to-city distance is designated as a predictor of shared temporal trends in crime and weather is shown to be a strong predictor of crime in Montgomery County.},

abstract={Increasing situational awareness and investigating the cause of a software-induced cyber attack continues to be one of the most difficult yet important endeavors faced by network security professionals. Traditionally, these forensic pursuits are carried out by manually analyzing the malicious software agents at the heart of the incident, and then observing their interactions in a controlled environment. Both these steps are time consuming and difficult to maintain due to the ever changing nature of malicious software. In this paper we introduce a network science based framework which conducts incident analysis on a dataset by constructing and analyzing relational communities. Construction of these communities is based on the connections of topological features formed when actors communicate with each other. We evaluate our framework using a network trace of the Black Energy malware network, captured by our honey net. We have found that our approach is accurate, efficient, and could prove as a viable alternative to the current status quo.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed rapid progress and significant success in the use of deep learning neural networks (DLNNs) in a wide range of applications. Recently, DLNN has been integrated with intrusion detection system (IDS) to enhance network security to detect zero-day attacks. However, DLNNs themselves have been recently found vulnerable to attacks called adversarial examples and backdoor attacks for image recognition applications. In this work, we present an effective defense method for DLNN based IDS by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the generation of triggers neurons selected based on their response to the features to produce the output. We embed the GA-Trigger-Detection neurons within the model to detect and prevent white-box advertorial examples and backdoor attacks against two DLNNs based IDS: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder Based Extreme Learning Machine (SSAELM). We implement two white-box adversarial examples and backdoor attacks from prior work and use them to investigate the proposed defense method. We show that the defense method is sufficient to defend against sophisticated attackers with 99% success rate and only 1% degrade in accuracy. We then show that it successfully weakens backdoor attacks on the two DNN architectures using two benchmark datasets: KDDCUP'99 and Kyoto. Our work provides an important step toward defenses against white-box advertorial examples and backdoor attacks in DLNNs based IDS.},

abstract={Recent examples have shown that sophisticated cyber attackers are capable of infiltrating the cyber defenses of major organizations and spreading stealthily through a network, potentially doing significant damage before exploited vulnerabilities can be identified or patches developed. Autonomous systems are particularly vulnerable because they are further removed from human intervention. One emerging technology designed to address this problem is proactive reset, where systems automatically undergo a reset operation that restores them to a known malware-free state, regardless of whether or not they were already infected. More frequent resets result in higher security, but may also reduce functionality of the network. In this work, we consider the effectiveness of three proactive reset policies for mitigating the spread of stealthy malware through a network of autonomous systems. We perform experiments using agent-based simulation and find that a proactive policy that uses risk-flow analysis to determine when systems should be reset achieves performance comparable to that of a perfect detector.},

abstract={The large datasets are being mined to extract hidden knowledge and patterns that assist decision makers in making effective, efficient, and timely decisions in an ever increasing competitive world. This type of “knowledge-driven” data mining activity is not possible without sharing the “datasets” between their owners and data mining experts (or corporations); as a consequence, protecting ownership (by embedding a watermark) on the datasets is becoming relevant. The most important challenge in watermarking (to be mined) datasets is: how to preserve knowledge in features or attributes? Usually, an owner needs to manually define “Usability constraints” for each type of dataset to preserve the contained knowledge. The major contribution of this paper is a novel formal model that facilitates a data owner to define usability constraints-to preserve the knowledge contained in the dataset-in an automated fashion. The model aims at preserving “classification potential” of each feature and other major characteristics of datasets that play an important role during the mining process of data; as a result, learning statistics and decision-making rules also remain intact. We have implemented our model and integrated it with a new watermark embedding algorithm to prove that the inserted watermark not only preserves the knowledge contained in a dataset but also significantly enhances watermark security compared with existing techniques. We have tested our model on 25 different data-mining datasets to show its efficacy, effectiveness, and the ability to adapt and generalize.},

abstract={There is a growing demand for large-scale distributed storage systems to support resource sharing and fault tolerance. Although heterogeneity issues of distributed systems have been widely investigated, little attention has yet been paid to security solutions designed for distributed storage systems with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. This fact motivates us to investigate a fragment allocation scheme called S-FAS to improve security of a distributed system where storage sites have a wide variety of vulnerabilities. In the S-FAS approach, we integrate file fragmentation with the secret sharing technique in a distributed storage system with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. Storage sites in a distributed systems are classified into a variety of different server types based on vulnerability characteristics. Given a file and a distributed system, S-FAS allocates fragments of the file to as many different types of nodes as possible in the system. Data confidentiality is preserved because fragments of a file are allocated to multiple storage nodes. We develop storage assurance and dynamic assurance models to evaluate the quality of security offered by S-FAS. Analysis results show that fragment allocations made by S-FAS lead to enhanced security because of the consideration of heterogeneous vulnerabilities in distributed storage systems.},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc networking (VANET) have become a significant technology in the current years because of the emerging generation of self-driving cars such as Google driverless cars. VANET have more vulnerabilities compared to other networks such as wired networks, because these networks are an autonomous collection of mobile vehicles and there is no fixed security infrastructure, no high dynamic topology and the open wireless medium makes them more vulnerable to attacks. It is important to design new approaches and mechanisms to rise the security these networks and protect them from attacks. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection mechanism for the VANETs using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The main role of IDS is to detect the attack using a data generated from the network behavior such as a trace file. The IDSs use the features extracted from the trace file as auditable data.

abstract={The increasing level of connectivity within vehicles and their environment such as backend or infrastructure increases the risk of potential vulnerabilities regarding information security. In order to minimize these risks, vehicle manufacturers are forced to implement appropriate countermeasures, which are increasingly embedded in approval regulations. As a reactive countermeasure, various approaches to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) exist within the research area to detect attack attempts as early as possible. In this paper, we shift into a new research direction and present an approach for the detection of anomalies in automotive diagnostic applications by using a statistical language model. We analyze incoming diagnostic frames using two different n-gram models (sequence-based and byte-based) to determine whether sequences and the bytes embedded are contextually valid. Since there is currently no publicly available data set of diagnostic data, the detection rate is limited to learned diagnostic uses cases from our own data recordings. Since it is very challenging to generate such a large amount of data, a further enhancement of the approach based on unsupervised learning by using a dynamic anomaly threshold would be promising.},

abstract={In adversarial deep learning, adversarial examples are used to attack the target models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs). The adversarial examples are always constructed by adding vicious perturbations to the original images, and the added perturbations are not easily perceived by human. In order to achieve high attack success rates of adversarial sample, existing attack strategies always increase the magnitudes of global perturbations. However, as the magnitudes are increasing, the attacks will be easily perceived by human. To address this problem, a new approach is proposed to generate adversarial examples with weighted perturbations and abbreviates as WP-AdvGAN. The weights distribution to perturbations are determined by the sensitivity of the target model to the corresponding local region in the adversarial examples. Local region with high sensitivity have greater impacts on the decision of the target model, so the perturbation weights for these regions will be increased in the adversarial sample, vice versa. Experiments performed on MNIST dataset demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed WP-AdvGAN are similar to the original images and have high attack success rates under both white-box and black-box attack settings.},

pages={206835-206847},
abstract={This article proposes a novel approach for predicting depth from a single image in a self-supervised manner, specifically using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with enhancements to improve training performance. We train our model to generate disparity maps or inverse depth maps using left/right stereo image supervision rather than direct supervision from depth ground truth. We avoid the problem of training instability in standard GANs by employing a relativistic discriminator that evaluates how realistic an input image is. Since the reconstructed image quality determines the disparity map's accuracy, we adopt the GMSD, one of the standout IQA algorithms, as a part of the image reconstruction loss function. A VGG-19 pre-trained model-based perceptual loss is used to optimize our model in a feature space instead of pixel space and to enhance reconstructed images' perceptual quality with the learning-based perspective. Also, we add another symmetric generator that takes the right images as input, which helps to maintain the consistency of left/right views and enrich our training data with reasonable overhead on the training time. Our network is trained to predict depths of 640 × 192 images using the KITTI stereo dataset, which shows an outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art works in various evaluation metrics. We verify our method's modules by performing an ablation study and evaluate the generalization performance on CityScapes and Make3D datasets.},

abstract={The advanced persistent threat (APT) as a new kind of cyber attack has posed a severe threat to modern organizations. When the APT has been detected, the organization has to deal with the APT response problem, i.e., to allocate the available response resources to fix her insecure hosts so as to mitigate her potential loss. This paper addresses the APT response problem by using the risk management approach. First, we introduce a model characterizing the evolution of the organization's expected state. By analyzing this model, we find the organization's expected state approaches a common limit expected state. Then, we use the organization's expected loss per unit time to measure her potential loss, and we find this measure is determined by the organization's limit expected state. On this basis, we model the APT response problem as a game-theoretic problem (the APT response game) in which the organization seeks a Nash equilibrium. We present a greedy algorithm for solving the game. Comparative experiments show that the algorithm is effective. Therefore, we recommend the response strategy generated by performing the algorithm. These findings contribute to defending against the APT. To our knowledge, this is the first time the APT response problem is addressed.},

abstract={The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is emerging as a global trend to dramatically enhance the intelligence and efficiency of the industries in recent years. With the emphasis on data communication by IIoT, cyber vulnerabilities are introduced at the same time. As a key subsystem of the industrial automation systems, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is becoming one of the primary targets for cyberattacks in the IIoT paradigm. In this paper, the semi-Markov process (SMP) is employed to model and evaluate the cyberattacks against the SCADA systems considering the insider assistance. Based on the SMP model, the probability distribution of the time-to-compromise the system of the attacks is derived with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Then, a FlipIt game model is developed to investigate the defense and attack strategies of the defender and attacker, and analyze the impacts of the insider assistance. Case studies were carried out to verify the proposed model. The results of the case studies show that the insider assistance will improve the payoff of the attacker and increase the defense action frequency of the system defender. With a high enough defense action frequency, the defender can force the attacker to drop out and eliminate the attack actions.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method to detect and identify multiple objects in an image using grid voting of object center positions estimated from local descriptor keypoint matches. For each keypoint match, the proposed method estimates the object center position using scale and orientation associated with the keypoints. Then, it casts a vote for an image grid where the estimated object center is located. For the grids with high number of votes, geometric verification of the keypoint matches is carried out to accurately localize multiple objects in the image. Since the computational complexity of the grid voting is O(n), where n is the number of estimated object centers, the proposed method runs faster than a conventional method using mean shift clustering with O(n2) complexity. Experimental results using images with 52 objects show that the proposed method reduces the computational time by approximately 60% compared to the conventional method, while identification accuracy is comparable. With the reduced computational complexity, industrial applications such as an efficient inventory management in retail using images are enabled in practical computational time.},

The proposed approach is based on event cameras, also called artificial retinas, which provide fast response and robustness against motion blur and lighting conditions. Our scheme guides the robot by only adjusting the position of features extracted in the event image plane to their goal positions at a predefined time using smooth time-to-contact trajectories. The proposed scheme is robust, efficient and can be added on top of commonly-used aerial robot velocity controllers. It has been validated on-board a UAV with real-time computation in low-cost hardware during sets of experiments with different descent maneuvers and lighting conditions.},

abstract={This paper presents a computational study of head motion in human interaction, notably of its role in conveying interlocutors' behavioral characteristics. Head motion is physically complex and carries rich information; current modeling approaches based on visual signals, however , are still limited in their ability to adequately capture these important properties. Guided by the methodology of kinesics , we propose a data-driven approach to identify typical head motion patterns. The approach follows the steps of first segmenting motion events, then parametrically representing the motion by linear predictive features, and finally generalizing the motion types using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed approach is experimentally validated using video recordings of communication sessions from real couples involved in a couples therapy study. In particular we use the head motion model to classify binarized expert judgments of the interactants' specific behavioral characteristics where entrainment in head motion is hypothesized to play a role: Acceptance, Blame, Positive, and Negative behavior. We achieve accuracies in the range of 60% to 70% for the various experimental settings and conditions. In addition, we describe a measure of motion similarity between the interaction partners based on the proposed model. We show that the relative change of head motion similarity during the interaction significantly correlates with the expert judgments of the interactants' behavioral characteristics. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed head motion model, and underscore the promise of analyzing human behavioral characteristics through signal processing methods.},

abstract={Power systems become a primary target of cyber attacks because of the vulnerability of the integrated communication networks. An attacker is able to manipulate the integrity of real-time data by maliciously modifying the readings of meters transmitted to the control center. Moreover, it is demonstrated that such attack can escape the bad data detection in state estimation if the topology and network information of the entire power grid is known to the attacker. In this paper, we propose an isolation forest (IF) based detection algorithm as a countermeasure against false data attack (FDA). This method requires no tedious pre-training procedure to obtain the labels of outliers. In addition, comparing with other algorithms, the IF based detection method can find the outliers quickly. The performance of the proposed detection method is verified using the simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus system.},

abstract={Network evasions can bypass network intrusion detection/prevention systems to deliver exploits, attacks, or malware to victims without being detected. This paper presents a novel method for the detection and recognition of atomic network evasions by the classification of a transmission control protocol (TCP) stream's packet behavior. The syntax for the conversion of TCP streams to codeword streams is proposed to facilitate the extraction of statistical features while preserving the evasion behavior attributes of original network flows. We developed a feature extraction method of employing the normalized term frequencies of codewords to characterize intra and inter packet attribute patterns hidden in actual TCP streams. A TCP stream is then transformed to a fixed length numeric feature vector. Supervised multi-class classifiers are built on the extracted feature vectors to differentiate different types of evasions from normal streams. The quantitative evaluations on an evasion dataset consisting of normal network flows and eight types of atomic evasion flows demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved an encouraging performance with an accuracy of 98.95%.},

abstract={To add more functionality and enhance usability of web applications, JavaScript (JS) is frequently used. Even with many advantages and usefulness of JS, an annoying fact is that many recent cyberattacks such as drive-by-download attacks exploit vulnerability of JS codes. In general, malicious JS codes are not easy to detect, because they sneakily exploit vulnerabilities of browsers and plugin software, and attack visitors of a web site unknowingly. To protect users from such threads, the development of an accurate detection system for malicious JS is soliciting. Conventional approaches often employ signature and heuristic-based methods, which are prone to suffer from zero-day attacks, i.e., causing many false negatives and/or false positives. For this problem, this paper adopts a machine-learning approach to feature learning called Doc2Vec, which is a neural network model that can learn context information of texts. The extracted features are given to a classifier model (e.g., SVM and neural networks) and it judges the maliciousness of a JS code. In the performance evaluation, we use the D3M Dataset (Drive-by-Download Data by Marionette) for malicious JS codes and JSUPACK for benign ones for both training and test purposes. We then compare the performance to other feature learning methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed Doc2Vec features provide better accuracy and fast classification in malicious JS code detection compared to conventional approaches.},

abstract={This paper proposes a systematic analysis method for 5G Non-Access Stratum Signalling security based on formal analysis, which has identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities, and an improved PKI security mechanism targeted at eliminating these vulnerabilities. Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an attacker's behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G. Besides the existing public-private key pair of the home network, we introduce a new pair of asymmetric keys in the gNodeB to encrypt and sign the signalling message sent to UE. The gNodeB can be connected only when the verification succeeds and then the RRC connection can be initiated. This mechanism can effectively avoid all the vulnerabilities found in this paper.},

abstract={Online social networks (OSNs) suffer from the creation of fake accounts that introduce fake product reviews, malware and spam. Existing defenses focus on using the social graph structure to isolate fakes. However, our work shows that Sybils could befriend a large number of real users, invalidating the assumption behind social-graph-based detection. In this paper, we present VoteTrust, a scalable defense system that further leverages user-level activities. VoteTrust models the friend invitation interactions among users as a directed, signed graph, and uses two key mechanisms to detect Sybils over the graph: a voting-based Sybil detection to find Sybils that users vote to reject, and a Sybil community detection to find other colluding Sybils around identified Sybils. Through evaluating on Renren social network, we show that VoteTrust is able to prevent Sybils from generating many unsolicited friend requests. We also deploy VoteTrust in Renen, and our real experience demonstrates that VoteTrust can detect large-scale collusion among Sybils.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose techniques for detecting anomalies in user accesses by learning profiles of normal access patterns of users based on both the syntactic and semantic features of past users queries stored in database logs. New accesses are checked upon these profiles and deviations are considered anomalous accesses which may be indications of potential insider attacks. We consider two scenarios. The first scenario is when the monitored database employs role-based access control (RBAC). In this scenario, we build profiles of roles rather than individual users, this makes our approach usable for databases which have a large user population. In this case, we use the naive Bayesian classification to detect anomalies. We also employ multilabeling classification to account for the case when roles have common access patterns. The second scenario is when RBAC is not used. In this case, we detect anomalies using the COBWEB clustering algorithm. We provide extensive evaluation for our techniques. Results show that our techniques are effective.},

abstract={The use of smartphone applications based on the Android OS platform is rapidly growing among smartphone users. However, malicious apps for Android are being developed to perform attacks, such as destroying operating systems, stealing confidential data, gathering personal information, and hijacking or encrypting sensitive data. Several malware detection systems based on machine learning have been developed and deployed to extract a variety of features to prevent such attacks. However, new efficient detection methods are needed to extract complex features and hidden structures from malicious apps to detect malware. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely, MalResLSTM, based on deep residual long short-term memory to identify and classify malware variants. The framework imposes a set of constraints on the deep learning architecture to capture dependencies between the extracted features from the Android package kit (APK) file. These feature sets are mapped to a vector space to process the input sequence using a sequence model based on the residual LSTM network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, several experiments are conducted on the Drebin dataset, which contains 129,013 applications. The results demonstrate that MalResLSTM can achieve a 99.32% detection accuracy and outperforms previous algorithms. An extensive experimental analysis was conducted, which included machine-learning-based algorithms and a variety of deep learning-based algorithms, to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed framework.},

abstract={The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.},

abstract={Speech enhancement and separation are core problems in audio signal processing, with commercial applications in devices as diverse as mobile phones, conference call systems, hands-free systems, or hearing aids. In addition, they are crucial preprocessing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multichannel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These communities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing a large number of established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: 1) the acoustic impulse response model, 2) the spatial filter design criterion, 3) the parameter estimation algorithm, and 4) optional postfiltering. We conclude this overview paper by providing a list of software and data resources and by discussing perspectives and future trends in the field.},

Dynamical behaviors of the SEIRS epidemic model is determined by basic reproductive ratio, which is often used as a threshold parameter. Also, the impact of the assignment of diverse software packages on the propagation process is examined. Theoretical results show that basic reproductive ratio is significantly dependent on diverse software packages and the network topology. The installation of diverse software packages on nodes leads to decrease reproductive ratio and malware spreading.

abstract={Physical layer security (PLS) technologies have attracted much attention in recent years for their potential to provide information-theoretically secure communications. Artificial Noise (AN)-aided transmission is considered as one of the most practicable PLS technologies, as it can realize secure transmission independent of the eavesdropper's channel status. In this paper, we reveal that AN transmission has the dependency of eavesdropper's channel condition by introducing our proposed attack method based on a supervised-learning algorithm which utilizes the modulation scheme, available from known packet preamble and/or header information, as supervisory signals of training data. Numerical simulation results with the comparison to conventional clustering methods show that our proposed method improves the success probability of attack from 4.8% to at most 95.8% for the QPSK modulation. It implies that the transmission to the receiver in the cell-edge with low order modulation will be cracked if the eavesdropper's channel is good enough by employing more antennas than the transmitter. This work brings new insights into the effectiveness of AN schemes and provides useful guidance for the design of robust PLS techniques for practical wireless systems.},

abstract={Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) are one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Given the continuous distribution of IoT devices, data confidentiality and user privacy are of utmost importance. However, with the growing complexity of SoCs, the risk of malware infections and trojans introduced at design time increases significantly. A vital threat to system security are so-called side-channel attacks based on cache observations. While mainly studied on desktop and server systems, recent publications have analyzed cache attacks on mobile devices and network-on-chip platforms. In this work, we investigate cache attacks on System-on-Chips implementing bus based communication. To this end, we present two contributions. First, we demonstrate an improved Prime+Probe based cache attack on AES-128 that, for the first time, exploits the bus communication to increase its efficiency. Second, we integrate two countermeasures (Shuffling and Mini-table) and evaluate their impact on the attack. The results show that our improved attack recovers the full key twice as fast as Prime+Probe without exploiting bus communication. Moreover, we propose protection techniques that are feasible and effectively mitigate both original and improved attack.},

abstract={Almost all adversarial attacks in computer vision are aimed at pre-known object categories, which could be offline trained for generating perturbations. But as for visual object tracking, the tracked target categories are normally unknown in advance. However, the tracking algorithms also have potential risks of being attacked, which could be maliciously used to fool the surveillance systems. Meanwhile, it is still a challenging task that adversarial attacks on tracking since it has the free-model tracked target. Therefore, to help draw more attention to the potential risks, we study adversarial attacks on tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot adversarial attack method to generate adversarial examples for free-model single object tracking, where merely adding slight perturbations on the target patch in the initial frame causes state-of-the-art trackers to lose the target in subsequent frames. Specifically, the optimization objective of the proposed attack consists of two components and leverages the dual attention mechanisms. The first component adopts a targeted attack strategy by optimizing the batch confidence loss with confidence attention while the second one applies a general perturbation strategy by optimizing the feature loss with channel attention. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly lower the accuracy of the most advanced Siamese network-based trackers on three benchmarks.},

pages={1069-1083},
abstract={The shrew distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is very detrimental for many applications, since it can throttle TCP flows to a small fraction of their ideal rate at very low attack cost. Earlier works mainly focused on empirical studies of defending against the shrew DDoS, and very few of them provided analytic results about the attack itself. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for estimating attack effect of this stealthy type of DDoS. By originally capturing the adjustment behaviors of victim TCPs congestion window, our model can comprehensively evaluate the combined impact of attack pattern (i.e., how the attack is configured) and network environment on attack effect (the existing models failed to consider the impact of network environment). Henceforth, our model has higher accuracy over a wider range of network environments. The relative error of our model remains around 10% for most attack patterns and network environments, whereas the relative error of the benchmark model in previous works has a mean value of 69.57%, and it could be more than 180% in some cases. More importantly, our model reveals some novel properties of the shrew attack from the interaction between attack pattern and network environment, such as the minimum cost formula to launch a successful attack, and the maximum effect formula of a shrew attack. With them, we are able to find out how to adaptively tune the attack parameters (e.g., the DoS burst length) to improve its attack effect in a given network environment, and how to reconfigure the network resource (e.g., the bottleneck buffer size) to mitigate the shrew DDoS with a given attack pattern. Finally, based on our theoretical results, we put forward a simple strategy to defend the shrew attack. The simulation results indicate that this strategy can remarkably increase TCP throughput by nearly half of the bottleneck bandwidth (and can be higher) for general attack patterns.},

abstract={Recently, low-shot learning has been proposed for handling the lack of training data in machine learning. Despite of the importance of this issue, relatively less efforts have been made to study this problem. In this paper, we aim to increase the size of training dataset in various ways to improve the accuracy and robustness of face recognition. In detail, we adapt a generator from the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to increase the size of training dataset, which includes a base set, a widely available dataset, and a novel set, a given limited dataset, while adopting transfer learning as a backend. Based on extensive experimental study, we conduct the analysis on various data augmentation methods, observing how each affects the identification accuracy. Finally, we conclude that the proposed algorithm for generating faces is effective in improving the identification accuracy and coverage at the precision of 99% using both the base and novel set.},

abstract={Recent research has provided evidence indicating how a malicious user could perform coresidence profiling and public-to-private IP mapping to target and exploit customers which share physical resources. The attacks rely on two steps: resource placement on the target's physical machine and extraction. Our proposed solution, in part inspired by mussel self-organization, relies on user account and workload clustering to mitigate coresidence profiling. Users with similar preferences and workload characteristics are mapped to the same cluster. To obfuscate the public-to-private IP map, each cluster is managed and accessed by an account proxy. Each proxy uses one public IP address, which is shared by all clustered users when accessing their instances, and maintains the mapping to private IP addresses. We describe a set of capabilities and attack paths an attacker needs to execute for targeted coresidence, and present arguments to show how our approach disrupts the critical steps in the attack path for most cases. We then perform a risk assessment to determine the likelihood an individual user will be victimized, given that a successful nondirected exploit has occurred. Our results suggest that while possible, this event is highly unlikely.},

abstract={With the development of the Internet, more and more network attacks are also emerging. The traditional intrusion detection system has been challenged tremendously, and it is unable to detect the new types of attacks. This paper proposes an intrusion detection model based on deepFM, which combines the advantages of FM algorithm for processing shallow features and the advantages of deep neural network for processing deep features, which can effectively extract features and classify them. We then performed experiments using the KDD CUP 99 dataset. First, the training set is deduplicated and oversampled to balance various types of samples, and then the processed data is used for training. Then optimize tuning parameters and find an optimal model. Finally, use the best model to make predictions on the test set. On the test set, we got a correct rate of 0.934 and a COST value of 0.191. By analyzing the results and comparing existing studies, we can conclude that the model proposed in this paper has a good effect on KDD 99 CUP and has certain practical value.},

abstract={Social media networks have shown rapid growth in the past, and massive social data are generated which can reveal behavior or emotion propensities of users. Numerous social researchers leverage machine learning technology to build social media analytic models which can detect the abnormal behaviors or mental illnesses from the social media data effectively. Although the researchers only public the prediction interfaces of the machine learning models, in general, these interfaces may leak information about the individual data records on which the models were trained. Knowing a certain user's social media record was used to train a model can breach user privacy. In this paper, we present SocInf and focus on the fundamental problem known as membership inference. The key idea of SocInf is to construct a mimic model which has a similar prediction behavior with the public model, and then we can disclose the prediction differences between the training and testing data set by abusing the mimic model. With elaborated analytics on the predictions of the mimic model, SocInf can thus infer whether a given record is in the victim model's training set or not. We empirically evaluate the attack performance of SocInf on machine learning models trained by Xgboost, logistics, and online cloud platform. Using the realistic data, the experiment results show that SocInf can achieve an inference accuracy and precision of 73% and 84%, respectively, in average, and of 83% and 91% at best.},

abstract={For a variety of cyber-attacks occurring in a power IoT-Cloud environment, conventional security intrusion incident detection and response technologies typically use pattern- and behavior-based statistical methods. However, they cannot provide fundamental solutions for a security intrusion or attacks, which are becoming more intelligent and diverse as time passes. Therefore, an effective response method that can respond to security intrusions intelligently while using an access control technique based on ontology reasoning is required. This can be achieved by adopting a variety of intelligent reasoning technologies for security intrusion incidents of power systems, such as various reasoning technologies based on the ontology and semantic-web technologies being actively studied in the field of intelligent systems, and malicious code detection technologies based on an intelligent access control model, text mining, and natural language processing technologies. Accordingly, a security context ontology was modeled by analyzing the security vulnerabilities of a power system in a power IoT-Cloud environment, and security context inference rules were defined. Furthermore, this paper presents an appropriate power IoT-Cloud security service framework that can be used in a power IoT-Cloud environment. In addition, a security mechanism that can be efficiently operated in such an environment is implemented. In experiments conducted for this application, attack context scenarios that commonly occur were created using a smart meter as an example, which is an essential power system device. Inference rules were then composed for each attack stage to check the paths of attacks those that exploit the vulnerability of a smart meter system. As a result, it was confirmed that a high level attack detection results can be obtained based on the inference rules.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly significant role in our daily activities, connecting physical objects around us into digital services. In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.},

Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F1 score of respectively > 99%.},

abstract={Honeypots are deployed to capture cyber attack data for analysis of attacker behavior. This paper analyses a honeypot dataset to establish attack types and corresponding temporal patterns. It calculates the probability of each attack type occurring at a particular time of day and tests these probabilities with a random sample from the honeypot dataset. Attacks can take many forms and can come from different geographical sources. Temporal patterns in attacks are often observed due to the diurnal nature of computer usage and thus attack types captured on a honeypot will also reflect these patterns. We propose that it is possible to determine the probability of differing attack types occurring at certain times of the day. Understanding attack behavior informs the implementation of more robust security measures. The paper also proposes automating this process to create dynamic and adaptive honeypots. An adaptive honeypot that can modify its security levels, can increase the attack vector at different times of the day. This will improve data collection for analysis that ultimately will lead to better cyber defenses.},

abstract={In order to address two main limitations of current content-based music recommendation approaches, an ordinal regression algorithm for music recommendation that incorporates dynamic information is presented. Instead of assuming that local spectral features within a song are identically and independently distributed examples of an underlying probability density, music is characterized by a vocabulary of acoustic segment models (ASMs), which are found with an unsupervised process. Further, instead of classifying music based on subjective classes, such as genre, or trying to find a universal notion of similarity, songs are classified based on personal preference ratings. The ordinal regression approach to perform the ratings prediction is based on the discriminative-training algorithm known as minimum classification error (MCE) training. Experimental results indicate that improved temporal modeling leads to superior performance over standard spectral-based music representations. Further, the MCE-based preference ratings algorithm is shown to be superior over two other systems. Analysis demonstrates that the superior performance is due to MCE being a non-conservative algorithm that demonstrates immunity to outliers.},

abstract={Due to respectively limited training data, different entities addressing the same vision task based on certain sensitive images may not train a robust deep network. This paper introduces a new vision task where various entities share task-specific image data to enlarge each other's training data volume without visually disclosing sensitive contents (e.g. illegal images). Then, we present a new structure-based training regime to enable different entities learn task-specific and reconstruction-proof image representations for image data sharing. Specifically, each entity learns a private Deep Poisoning Module (DPM) and insert it to a pre-trained deep network, which is designed to perform the specific vision task. The DPM deliberately poisons convolutional image features to prevent image reconstructions, while ensuring that the altered image data is functionally equivalent to the non-poisoned data for the specific vision task. Given this equivalence, the poisoned features shared from one entity could be used by another entity for further model refinement. Experimental results on image classification prove the efficacy of the proposed method.},

The model enables cyber risk analysis to better understand the costs for an adversary to attack a system, which directly influences the cost to defend it. Method: The model is based on four historical studies of adversarial capabilities: capability to exploit Windows XP, to exploit the Android API, to exploit Apache, and to administer compromised industrial control systems. Result: We propose the ACC with five phases: Discovery, Validation, Escalation, Democratization, and Ubiquity. We use the four case studies as examples as to how the ACC can be applied and used to predict attack likelihood and intensity.},

Intrusion Detection and Response Systems (IDRS), as a proactive solution, continuously monitor system health based on Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts, so that malicious activities can be handled effectively by applying appropriate countermeasures to prevent problems from worsening and return the system to a healthy state. In this paper, a novel IDRS is proposed which processes the generated alerts in real time, correlates the alerts, calculates the risk of correlated alerts and models the attack scenarios and their countermeasures using the concept of Bayesian decision networks (BDNs). The proposed framework has two modes: online and offline. In the offline mode, a BDN model is constructed. Then, in the online mode, using the generated BDN, the next probable intentions of attackers are predicted and the optimal sets of countermeasures are identified to prevent the attackers reaching their goals. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the security level of computer systems in terms of forecasting the multi-step attacks before they can compromise the network and determining the optimal security risk mitigation plans to prevent damages to the organizations assets.},

Then, considering the functional attributes of logical nodes, a hyper-network model of substation auto system (SAS) is proposed using hyper-graph theory. On this basis, a CPS model that takes into account the functional influence after data attack is established. In addition, combined with the analysis of the network model, the efficiency indexes are given to evaluate the effectiveness of the CPS under data attack. The reasons why we choose these indexes in network and hyper-network model are also explained. Finally, the analysis in the case study illustrates that the method proposed is helpful for identifying critical elements of the CPS, which provides a new avenue for future vulnerability analysis research.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides us with the capability of collecting network traffic information and managing networks proactively. Therefore, SDN facilitates the promotion of more robust and secure networks. Recently, several Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) intrusion detection approaches have been proposed to secure SDN networks. Currently, most of the proposed ML/DL intrusion detection approaches are based on supervised learning approach that required labelled and well-balanced datasets for training. However, this is time intensive and require significant human expertise to curate these datasets. These approaches cannot deal well with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we propose a hybrid unsupervised DL approach using the stack autoencoder and One-class Support Vector Machine (SAE-1SVM) for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average accuracy of 99.35 % with a small set of flow features. The SAE-1SVM shows that it can reduce the processing time significantly while maintaining a high detection rate. In summary, the SAE-1SVM can work well with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets and yield a high detection accuracy.},

abstract={As more and more cloud services are exposed to DDoS attacks, DDoS attack detect has become a new challenging task because large packet traces captured on fast links could not be easily handled on a single server with limited computing and memory resources. In this paper, we propose a Hadoop based model to identify abnormal packets and compute the statistics according to the number of abnormal packets. The novelties of the model are that:(1) by harnessing HBASE, an improved bloom filter based mapping mechanism named TCP2HC/UDP2HC are implemented, (2)with the characteristics of IP spoofing and the temporal correlation of transport layer connection state, an extensible set of rules and a reliable MapReduce based checking mechanism for abnormal packets are designed, (3) using statistic features extracted from the increased abnormal packets and TCP/UDP flow, a non-parameter CUSUM algorithm is used to detect most DDoS attacks accurately and efficiently. The model can detect the attack behavior in the early stage, which is beneficial to mitigate attack with the help of flow cleaning by converting a check rule to the filtering rule. Experiments show no matter how large the attack scale and what kind of DDoS attack, the detection model can soon detect DDoS attack accurately.},

abstract={When filling out privacy-related forms in public places such as hospitals or clinics, people usually are not aware that the sound of their handwriting leaks personal information. In this paper, we explore the possibility of eavesdropping on handwriting via nearby mobile devices based on audio signal processing and machine learning. By presenting a proof-of-concept system, WritingHacker, we show the usage of mobile devices to collect the sound of victims' handwriting, and to extract handwriting-specific features for machine learning based analysis. WritingHacker focuses on the situation where the victim's handwriting follows certain print style. An attacker can keep a mobile device, such as a common smartphone, touching the desk used by the victim to record the audio signals of handwriting. Then, the system can provide a word-level estimate for the content of the handwriting. To reduce the impacts of various writing habits and writing locations, the system utilizes the methods of letter clustering, dictionary filtering and letter time length based offsetting. Moreover, if the relative position between the device and the handwriting is known, a hand motion tracking method can be further applied to enhance the system's performance. Our prototype system's experimental results show that the accuracy of word recognition reaches around 70 - 80 percent under certain conditions, which reveals the danger of privacy leakage through the sound of handwriting.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition systems to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints. MasterPrints are real or synthetic fingerprints that can fortuitously match with a large number of fingerprints thereby undermining the security afforded by fingerprint systems. Previous work by Roy et al. generated synthetic MasterPrints at the feature-level. In this work we generate complete image-level MasterPrints known as DeepMasterPrints, whose attack accuracy is found to be much superior than that of previous methods. The proposed method, referred to as Latent Variable Evolution, is based on training a Generative Adversarial Network on a set of real fingerprint images. Stochastic search in the form of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy is then used to search for latent input variables to the generator network that can maximize the number of impostor matches as assessed by a fingerprint recognizer. Experiments convey the efficacy of the proposed method in generating DeepMasterPrints. The underlying method is likely to have broad applications in fingerprint security as well as fingerprint synthesis.},

abstract={Iris recognition systems transform an iris image into a feature vector. The seminal pipeline segments an image into iris and non-iris pixels, normalizes this region into a fixed-dimension rectangle, and extracts features which are stored and called a template (Daugman, 2009). This template is stored on a system. A future reading of an iris can be transformed and compared against template vectors to determine or verify the identity of an individual. As templates are often stored together, they are a valuable target to an attacker. We show how to invert templates across a variety of iris recognition systems. Our inversion is based on a convolutional neural network architecture we call RESIST (REconStructing IriSes from Templates). We apply RESIST to a traditional Gabor filter pipeline, to a DenseNet (Huang etal., CVPR 2017) feature extractor, and to a DenseNet architecture that works without normalization. Both DenseNet feature extractors are based on the recent ThirdEye recognition system (Ahmad and Fuller, BTAS 2019). When training and testing using the ND-0405 dataset, reconstructed images demonstrate a rank-1 accuracy of 100%, 76%, and 96% respectively for the three pipelines. The core of our approach is similar to an autoencoder. To obtain high accuracy this core is integrated into an adversarial network (Goodfellow et al., NeurIPS, 2014).},

abstract={Smart grids rely on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to monitor and control complex electrical networks in order to provide reliable energy to homes and industries. However, the increased inter-connectivity and remote accessibility of SCADA systems expose them to cyber attacks. As a consequence, developing effective security mechanisms is a priority in order to protect the network from internal and external attacks. We propose an integrated framework for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for smart grids which combines feature engineering-based preprocessing with machine learning classifiers. Whilst most of the machine learning techniques fine-tune the hyper-parameters to improve the detection rate, our approach focuses on selecting the most promising features of the dataset using Gradient Boosting Feature Selection (GBFS) before applying the classification algorithm, a combination which improves not only the detection rate but also the execution speed. GBFS uses the Weighted Feature Importance (WFI) extraction technique to reduce the complexity of classifiers. We implement and evaluate various decision-tree based machine learning techniques after obtaining the most promising features of the power grid dataset through a GBFS module, and show that this approach optimizes the False Positive Rate (FPR) and the execution time.},

abstract={Due to the constrained resource and computational limitation of many Internet of Things (IoT) devices, conventional security protections, which require high computational overhead are not suitable to be deployed. Thus, vulnerable IoT devices could be easily exploited by attackers to break into networks. In this paper, we employ cyber deception and moving target defense (MTD) techniques to proactively change the network topology with both real and decoy nodes with the support of software-defined networking (SDN) technology and investigate the impact of single-target and multi-target attacks on the effectiveness of the integrated mechanism via a hierarchical graphical security model with security metrics. We also implement a web-based visualization interface to show topology changes with highlighted attack paths. Finally, the qualitative security analysis is performed for a small-scale and SDN-supported IoT network with different combinations of decoy types and levels of attack intelligence. Simulation results show the integrated defense mechanism can introduce longer mean-time-to-security-failure and larger attack impact under the multi-target attack, compared with the single-target attack model. In addition, adaptive shuffling has better performance than fixed interval shuffling in terms of a higher proportion of decoy paths, longer mean-time-to-security-failure and largely reduced defense cost.},

abstract={Moderation of user-generated content in an online community is a challenge that has great socio-economic ramifications. However, the costs incurred by delegating this paper to human agents are high. For this reason, an automatic system able to detect abuse in user-generated content is of great interest. There are a number of ways to tackle this problem, but the most commonly seen in practice are word filtering or regular expression matching. The main limitations are their vulnerability to intentional obfuscation on the part of the users, and their context-insensitive nature. Moreover, they are language dependent and may require appropriate corpora for training. In this paper, we propose a system for automatic abuse detection that completely disregards message content. We first extract a conversational network from raw chat logs and characterize it through topological measures. We then use these as features to train a classifier on our abuse detection task. We thoroughly assess our system on a dataset of user comments originating from a French massively multiplayer online game. We identify the most appropriate network extraction parameters and discuss the discriminative power of our features, relatively to their topological and temporal nature. Our method reaches an F -measure of 83.89 when using the full feature set, improving on existing approaches. With a selection of the most discriminative features, we dramatically cut computing time while retaining the most of the performance (82.65).},

The IoE is accompanied by several substantial opportunities in all fields of life, ranging from the energy sector to the healthcare industry.

The evolution in the plethora of ubiquitous devices has raised several insider threats, thus generating concerns of security and privacy within enterprises who have framed the use of smart devices through IoE.

The information system has many safety problems such as data leakage and denial of service besides providing services for the users. How to evaluate the security defense system quantitatively and optimize the deployment of devices, becomes an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming at these problems above, a security defense evaluation method of internal network based on the traffic of devices is proposed. This method quantifies the defense effectiveness, it realizes the objective evaluation on defense effectiveness from two dimensions. One is the severity of potential attack risk, another is the response of a device with defense function. In practical application, this method can evaluate the effectiveness of defense scheme under different application scenes and different security risk defining standards. It doesn't need modeling and analysis for special context separately, and it can evaluate the effectiveness of system's defense strategy quantitatively. Comparing with the method which security staff simulate attack behaviors by penetration testing, this method is more comprehensive and controllable. It is helpful to confirm the relationship between network security device and protected asset, the relationship between security threat and defense, and the relationship between security devices and whole defense system. Through analyzing the evaluation result, the efficiency of the evaluation method of the security defense capability of internal network is proved.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a novel paradigm as more and more devices are connected to the Internet, enabling several innovative applications such as smart home, industrial automation, and connected health. However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home's traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.},

abstract={This paper presents a system for detecting intrusions when analyzing the network traffic payload looking for malware evidences. The system implements the detection algorithm as a Snort preprocessor component. Since they work together, a highly effective system against known attacks has been achieved (based on Snort rules) and a highly effective system against unknown threats (which was the main aim of the designed system). As the majority of such systems, the proposal consists of two phases: a training phase and a detection phase. During the training phase a statistical model of the legitimate network usage is created through Bloom Filters and N-grams techniques. Subsequently, the results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks are compared with such model. This will allow a set of rules to be developed which will be able to determine whether the packets payloads contain malware. In the detection phase, the traffic to analyze is compared with the model created in the training phase and the results obtained when applying rules. The performed experiments showed really satisfactory results, with 100% malware detection and just 0.15% false positives.},

In essence, residual register values and shared local memory in the iGPU are not cleared during a context switch. As a result, adversaries can recover the secret key of a cryptographic algorithm running on an iGPU from a single snapshot of the leaking channel. User privacy is also under threat due to browser activity eavesdropping through website-fingerprinting attack with high accuracy and resolution.

abstract={Leakage of information through the power supply current has become a major factor in logic design. In this paper, a low cost and simple to employ design methodology dubbed pseudoasynchronous is presented. This design style combines the security advantages of asynchronous circuits with the ease of synchronous circuit design. Randomization and data-dependencies (DD) are utilized to hide information leakage from the current dissipation, and hence making the critical synchronization of power supply current traces hard to do. In addition, randomization and DD are utilized for both time-domain hiding of information leakage during the active region (dynamic currents) and for amplitude-domain hiding of information leakage during the static-region (leakage currents). The main advantages of this new approach are low area cost, reduced signal, and increased noise. Circuit-level analyses show that it is harder to exploit the information leakage from internal signals of the proposed design than from CMOS-based synchronous designs or other forms of time-domain hiding countermeasures.},

As such, they serve as a security measure for evaluation and comparison of security-oriented implementations. When properly designed, data-dependent delays can be used as a barrier to these attacks. This paper introduces a security-oriented delay assignment algorithm for mitigating single and multibit attacks. The algorithm enables a reduction of the correlation between the processed data and the consumed current by utilizing the data-dependent delays as a source of correlated noise. This is done while minimizing the area overhead, propagation time, and power. We show that for the same security level this new algorithm provides X2 and X6 more area efficiency, and X1.5 and X2.25 higher frequencies than a permuted path delay assignment and random embedding of delay elements.},

abstract={Audio watermarking plays an important role in copyright protection. Echo hiding, one of the most effective techniques for audio watermarking, has been studied for decades. However, the conventional echo hiding has been criticized for its weak security, as watermarks can be easily extracted by means of cepstrum analysis even without any prior knowledge. This article explores the time-frequency (T-F) characteristics of the repetition structures in an audio signal to improve the security of conventional echo hiding. In our approach, the original audio signal is first converted into a high-dimensional T-F representation, and then by clustering the time frames that have similar T-F characteristics into the same subspace, the original audio is decomposed into a union of subspaces with each corresponding to one time-domain subsignal. Paired and opposite echo kernels are applied to energy-balanced subsignals for watermark embedding, which significantly improves the security. In the watermark extraction process, the subspaces are recovered on the basis of the T-F similarities and cepstrum analysis is utilized to extract watermarks. The proposed embedding and extraction schemes thus offer a new approach for echo hiding. The results of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with respect to inaudibility, security, and robustness.},

pages={8218-8227},
abstract={State estimation is critical to the monitoring and control of smart grids. Recently, the false data injection attack (FDIA) is emerging as a severe threat to state estimation. Conventional FDIA detection approaches are limited by their strong statistical knowledge assumptions, complexity, and hardware cost. Moreover, most of the current FDIA detection approaches focus on detecting the presence of FDIA, while the important information of the exact injection locations is not attainable. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, we propose a deep-learning-based locational detection architecture (DLLD) to detect the exact locations of FDIA in real time. The DLLD architecture concatenates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a standard bad data detector (BDD). The BDD is used to remove the low-quality data. The followed CNN, as a multilabel classifier, is employed to capture the inconsistency and co-occurrence dependency in the power flow measurements due to the potential attacks. The proposed DLLD is “model-free” in the sense that it does not leverage any prior statistical assumptions. It is also “cost-friendly” in the sense that it does not alter the current BDD system and the runtime of the detection process is only hundreds of microseconds on a household computer. Through extensive experiments in the IEEE bus systems, we show that DLLD can perform locational detection precisely under various noise and attack conditions. In addition, we also demonstrate that the employed multilabel classification approach effectively enhances the presence-detection accuracy.},

abstract={Side-channel attacks constitute a concrete threat to IoT systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). Embedded memories implemented with 6T SRAM macrocells often dominate the area and power consumption of these SoCs. Regardless of the computational platform, the side-channel sensitivity of low-hierarchy cache memories can incur significant overhead to protect the memory content (i.e., data encryption, data masking, etc.). In this manuscript, we provide a silicon proof of the effectiveness of a low cost side-channel attack protection that is embedded within the memory macro to achieve a significant reduction in information leakage. The proposed solution incorporates low-cost impedance randomization units, which are integrated into the periphery of a conventional 6T SRAM macro in fine-grain memory partitions, providing possible protection against electromagnetic adversaries. Various blocks of unprotected and protected SRAM macros were designed and fabricated in a 55 nm test-chip. The protected ones had little as 1% area overhead and less than 5% performance and power penalties compared to a conventional SRAM design. To evaluate the security of the proposed solution, we applied a robust mutual information metric and an adaptation to the memory context to enhance this evaluation framework. Assessment of the protected memory demonstrated a significant information leakage reduction from 8 bits of information exposed after only 100 cycles of attack to less than ~1.5 bits of mutual information after 160K traces. The parametric nature of the protection mechanisms are discussed while specifying the proposed design parameters. Overall, the proposed methodology enables designs with higher security-level at a minimal cost.},

abstract={Bidirectional communication infrastructure of smart systems, such as smart grids, are vulnerable to network attacks like distributed denial of services (DDoS) and can be a major concern in the present competitive market. In DDoS attack, multiple compromised nodes in a communication network flood connection requests, bogus data packets or incoming messages to targets like database servers, resulting in denial of services for legitimate users. Recently, machine learning based techniques have been explored by researchers to secure the network from DDoS attacks. Under different attack scenarios on a system, measurements can be observed either in an online manner or batch mode and can be used to build predictive learning systems. In this work, we propose an efficient DDoS attack detection technique based on multilevel auto-encoder based feature learning. We learn multiple levels of shallow and deep auto-encoders in an unsupervised manner which are then used to encode the training and test data for feature generation. A final unified detection model is then learned by combining the multilevel features using and efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm. We perform experiments on two benchmark DDoS attack databases and their subsets and compare the results with six recent methods. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the security assessment of electricity distribution networks (DNs) with vulnerable distributed energy resource (DER) nodes. The adversary model is a simultaneous compromise of DER nodes by strategic manipulation of generation setpoints. The loss to the defender (DN operator) includes loss of voltage regulation and cost of induced load control under supply-demand mismatch caused by the attack. A three-stage defender-attacker-defender (DAD) game is formulated: in Stage 1, the defender chooses a security strategy to secure a subset of DER nodes; in Stage 2, the attacker compromises a set of vulnerable DERs and injects false generation setpoints; in Stage 3, the defender responds by controlling loads and non-compromised DERs. Solving this trilevel optimization problem is hard due to nonlinear power flows and mixed-integer decision variables. To address this challenge, the problem is approximated by a tractable formulation based on an ε-linear power-flow model. The set of critical DER nodes and the setpoint manipulations characterizing the optimal attack strategy are computed. An iterative greedy approach to computing attacker-defender strategies for the original nonlinear problem is proposed. These results provide guidelines for optimal security investment and defender response in preattack and postattack conditions, respectively.},

abstract={Shader lamps can augment physical objects with projected virtual replications using a camera-projector system, provided that the physical and virtual object are well registered to each other. Precise registration and tracking has been a cumbersome and intrusive process in the past. In this paper, we present a new method for tracking complex-shaped physical objects interactively. In contrast to previous approaches our system is mobile and makes solely use of the projection of the virtual replication to track the physical object and “stick” the projection to it. Our method consists of two stages, a fast pose initialization based on structured light patterns and a non-intrusive frame-by-frame tracking based on features detected in the projection. During the tracking phase, a radiometrically corrected virtual camera view based on the current pose prediction is rendered and compared to the captured image. Matched features are triangulated providing a sparse set of surface points that is robustly aligned to the virtual model. The alignment transformation serves as an input for the new pose prediction. Detailed experiments including the evaluation of the overlay accuracy show that our approach can accurately and robustly track complex objects at interactive rates.},

abstract={Traditionally, dynamic detection approaches to Malware identification are commended for their simplicity and small sized signature database. In practice they suffer from two major defects. First, Malware might need to be emulated for a long time before traces of harmful behavior are first exhibited. Second, a few Anti-VM techniques are widely known and can be easily employed by any program to thwart the attempt of having it executed in a sandbox and observe its original behavior, rendering the approach less than effective. On the other hand, static detection approaches, have their own limitations, ranging from parsing obfuscated executables to the scalability issues due to the ever-increasing size of the signature database. Fundamentally, in the last 10-15 years polymorphic and metamorphic obfuscation techniques have become prevalent making static approaches less than effective due to the sheer magnitude of the sample set1. While the benefits of either dynamic or static approaches look quite tempting from each of their counterparts perspectives, their weakness are daunting in their own sight as well. In this manuscript we attempted to combine the best part of both worlds, without bringing in the disadvantage of either of them. We call this mixed approach “Segmented Sandboxing”.},

abstract={Over the last few decades, sustainable computing has been widely used in areas like social computing, artificial intelligence-based agent systems, mobile computing, and Internet of Things (IoT). There are social, economic, and commercial impacts of IoT on human lives. However, IoT nodes are generally power-constrained with data transmission using an open channel, i.e., Internet which opens the gates for various types of attacks on them. In this context, several efforts are initiated to deal with the evolving security issues in IoT systems and make them self-sufficient to harvest energy for smooth functioning. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we explore the evolving vulnerabilities in IoT devices. We provide a state-of-the-art survey that addresses multiple dimensions of the IoT realm. Moreover, we provide a general overview of IoT, Sustainable IoT, its architecture, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocol suite. Subsequently, we explore the open-source tools and datasets for the proliferation in research and growth of IoT. A detailed taxonomy of attacks associated with various vulnerabilities is also presented in the text. Then we have specifically focused on the IoT Vulnerability Assessment techniques followed by a case study on sustainability of Smart Agriculture. Finally, this paper outlines the emerging challenges related to IoT and its sustainability, and opening the doors for the beginners to start research in this promising area.},

abstract={The management of a complex cyber-physical system such as the Smart Grid (SG) requires responsive, scalable and high-bandwidth communication, which is often beyond the capabilities of the classical closed communication networks of the power grid. Consequently, the use of scalable public IP-based networks is increasingly being advocated. However, a direct consequence of the use of public networks is the exposure of the SG to varied reliability/security risks, e.g., distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). Thus the need exists for new lightweight mechanisms that can provide both cost-effective communication along with proactive DDoS attack protection. We fill this gap by proposing a novel approach termed as SeReCP, which leverages: (1) a semi-trusted P2P-based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) system providing a proactive countermeasure for DDoS attacks and secure group communications by aid of a group key management system, (2) a data diffusion mechanism that sustains the network availability in the case of both randomly sweeping and targeted DDoS attacks on pub-sub brokers, and (3) a multi-homing-based fast recovery mechanism for detecting and requesting the dropped packets, thus paving the way for meeting the stringent laency requirements os SG applications. Our evaluation on a real testbed demonstrates that SG applications. Our evaluation on a real testbed demonstrates that SeReCP provides the required security and availability of SG applications with up to 30% failures of the pnb-snb brokers. Overall, we show that SeReCP helps enable the secure use of public network based communication for safety-critical cyber-physical systems such as the SG.},

abstract={In recent years, deep learning models have been widely adopted for transfer learning tasks. The deep models, however, were shown to be easily attacked by adversarial examples, which is generated from original samples with the carefully designed small perturbations. Thus, the transfer learning models based on deep networks will also face this problem. Because of the particularity of transfer learning tasks, using the conventional adversarial training to improve the robustness of deep transfer models is very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel Double Transfer Learning with Adversarial Training (DTLAT) method to enhance the robustness of deep transfer learning models. Our intuition is using the instances of the source domain and target domain to help with adversarial training. At the same time, we design a reverse transfer learning method to weaken the effect of attack methods and improve the performance of deep transfer models of target domain. We regard the adversarial examples from some kind of attack method, like FGSM, as an adversarial domain while try to improve the generalization ability on other attacks method. Experiments demonstrate that DTLAT exceed many other methods about improving the robustness of the deep transfer model on several benchmark datasets.},

In this context, design patterns propose already used and optimized solutions to specific problems in various contexts. Applying design patterns might help to reuse existing knowledge about similar development issues. However, so far, there is a lack of taxonomies on design patterns for self-adaptive systems.

abstract={Visual odometry (VO) is one of the essential techniques in mobile robots field; an accurate VO system is of great significance for mobile robot simultaneous localization and mapping. As for traditional monocular VO systems, they work by presuming the monocular scale is 1 (scale = 1), or relying on ground truth (GT) to estimate scale. As a result, the traditional monocular VO systems estimate the pose state with big drift or cannot work on the image sequence without GT. Although some classical monocular VO systems have been proposed, they still have imperfect performance or even unable to work in some extreme scene conditions, such as scene is monotony without obvious texture information or camera large-scale displacement motion. As for learning-based VO system, it is realized by training deep neural networks in supervised or self-supervised manner to end-to-end estimate the pose state; however, the accuracy of pose estimation entirely depends on the ability of networks. Although the ability of networks can be improved by increasing the number of training data sets and optimizing the network structure, it is inevitable to encounter problems such as insufficient generalization ability and insufficient accuracy on rotational pose estimation. In this article, a monocular VO system named DL_Hybrid is proposed, which takes full advantage of DL networks used in image processing and geometric localization theory based on hybrid pose estimation methods. The DL_Hybrid VO system can estimate a six-DoF pose one-frame-by-one-frame and recover camera trajectory, and it can extract accurate key points from per-frame even in extreme scene condition, and it has good performance even in the extreme moving condition, such as camera rotation-only action or static action, also it can work well in the condition of camera large-scale displacement motion. The real scale is also accurately estimated without depending on GT, and the pose estimation method is designed based on hybrid 2d-2d and 3d-2d localization theory to make the DL_Hyrid VO system to estimate translational and rotational information with accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed DL_Hybrid VO system has a better performance than traditional and learning-based VO systems.},

In this paper, we present a concept for identifying agents with exploitation strategies that works on a system-wide analysis of trust and work relationships. Afterwards, we introduce a system-wide control loop to isolate these malicious elements using a norm-based approach - due to the agents' autonomy, we have to build on indirect control actions. Within simulations of a Desktop Computing Grid scenario, we show that the intelligent control loop works highly successful: these malicious elements are identified and isolated with a low error rate. We further demonstrate that the approach results in a significant increase of utility for all participating benevolent agents.},

abstract={Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack is an side-channel attack which aims at encrypted web traffic. WF attackers recognize encrypted website traffic through constructing fingerprinting for each website using the flow-based features extracted from encrypted traffic. WF defense typically aims at modifying the features of the encrypted websites. However, those countermeasures either cause high overhead or fail to counter the subsequent WF attacks. Especially, the newest WF attacks, which are based on deep neural network, is able to classify the defended traffic by directly learning from the labeled defended traffic. In this paper, we propose an novel defense through making use of the trick that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial exmaples. We design WF-GAN, a GAN with an additional WF classifier component, to generate adversarial examples for WF classifiers through adversarial learning. As the website set is divided into source and target website, WF-GAN are trained to map websites features from source set to adversarial examples and make adversarial examples more similar to the website features in the target set. The experimental result shows that WF-GAN achieves 90% success rate with at most 15% overhead for untargeted defense, which outperforms previous defense. In addition, adversarial examples based defense support targeted defense, which is not support by traditional defense. The result shows that WF-GAN achieves over 90% targeted defense success rate when the target websites set is twice as many as the source website set.},

We consider realistic types of poisoning and evasion attacks targeting security solutions devoted to malware, spam and network intrusion detection. We explore the possible damages that an attacker can cause to a cyber detector and present some existing and original defensive techniques in the context of intrusion detection systems. This paper contains several performance evaluations that are based on extensive experiments using large traffic datasets. The results highlight that modern adversarial attacks are highly effective against machine-learning classifiers for cyber detection, and that existing solutions require improvements in several directions. The paper paves the way for more robust machine-learning-based techniques that can be integrated into cyber security platforms.},

abstract={Communications security is a critical and increasingly challenging issue in wireless networks. A well-known approach for achieving information-theoretic secrecy relies on deploying artificial noises to blind the intruders' interception in the physical layer. However, this approach requires a static channel condition for the transmitter and receiver to generate and offset the controllable artificial noise, which can hardly be implemented in real wireless environments. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of symbol obfuscation to defend against the passive eavesdropping attack and fake packet injection attack during the wireless communications. We propose a multiple inter-symbol obfuscation (MIO) scheme, which utilizes a set of artificial noisy symbols (symbols key) to obfuscate the original data symbols in the physical layer. MIO can effectively enhance the wireless communications security. On the one hand, an eavesdropper, without knowing the artificial noisy symbols, cannot correctly decrypt the obfuscated symbols from the eavesdropped packets. On the other hand, a legitimate receiver can easily check the integrity of the symbols key and then reject the fake packets from the received packets. The security analysis reveals that, without considering the initial key, the MIO scheme can achieve information-theoretic secrecy against the passive eavesdropping attack and computational secrecy against the fake packet injection attack. Moreover, we have implemented our approach in a USRP2 testbed and conducted simulations with Simulink tools to validate the effectiveness of MIO in enhancing wireless communications security.},

abstract={This thesis focuses on the detection of malware in industrial Internet. The basic flow of the detection of malware contains feature extraction and sample identification. API graph can effectively represent the behavior information of malware. However, due to the high algorithm complexity of solving the problem of subgraph isomorphism, the efficiency of analysis based on graph structure feature is low. Due to the different scales of API graph of different malicious codes, the API graph needs to be normalized. Considering the difficulties of sample collection and manual marking, it is necessary to expand the number of malware samples in industrial Internet. This paper proposes a method that combines PageRank with TF-IDF to process the API graph. Besides, this paper proposes a method to construct the adversarial samples of malwares based on GAN.},

Cyber-attacks in the sensing or communication layers can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides a detailed review of potential cyber threats related to the sensing layer.

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely adopted but they are vulnerable to intentionally crafted adversarial examples. Various attack methods against DNNs have been proposed, yet there still lacks theoretical explanation of adversarial examples. In this paper, we aim to understand adversarial examples from the attacking process and we assume adding perturbations to the key/sensitive regions of the image could fool image classification DNNs. We propose gradient shielding to verify the assumption which ignores insensitive information during generating adversarial examples. Specifically, we propose interactive gradient shielding (IGS) method which selects sensitive regions and then applies gradient-based attack. To remove region selection, we propose adaptive gradient shielding (AGS) method which ignores insensitive gradients automatically. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and the results also corroborate our perspective. With this method, we won the first place in IJCAI-AAAC 2019 Non-targeted Adversarial Attack competition.},

volume={11},

pages={2187-2202},
abstract={The randomization methods that are applied for privacy-preserving data mining are commonly subject to reconstruction, linkage, and semantic-related attacks. Some existing works employed random noise addition to realize probabilistic anonymity, aiming only at linkage attacks. Random noise addition is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, and is unable to achieve semantic closeness, particularly on high-dimensional data, to prevent semantic-related attacks. For linkage attacks, the main security vulnerability of their proposed probabilistic anonymity lies in the assumption that the attacker had a priori knowledge of the quasi-identifiers of all individuals. When only some individuals leak their quasi-identifiers, the proposed model will become incapable, because the attacker can deploy a different linkage attack that has not been studied before. This type of attack is much easier to deploy and is thus very harmful. In this paper, we propose new frameworks of probabilistic (1, k)and (k, k)-anonymity to defend against all these linkage attacks, and realize the frameworks on a hybrid randomization model. The model is also secure against reconstruction attacks. We further achieve statistical semantic closeness of high-dimensional data to prevent semantic-related attacks on the model. The frameworks also allow us to re-design the traditional K-nearest neighbor algorithm to leverage the introduced data uncertainty and improve the mining results. This paper demonstrates the promising applications in large-scale and high-dimensional data mining in clouds, by providing high efficiency and security to protect data privacy, guaranteeing high data utility for mining purposes, on-time processing, and non-interactive data publishing.},

year={2017},

pages={20524-20535},
abstract={Today's cities generate tremendous amounts of data, thanks to a boom in affordable smart devices and sensors. The resulting big data creates opportunities to develop diverse sets of context-aware services and systems, ensuring smart city services are optimized to the dynamic city environment. Critical resources in these smart cities will be more rapidly deployed to regions in need, and those regions predicted to have an imminent or prospective need. For example, crime data analytics may be used to optimize the distribution of police, medical, and emergency services. However, as smart city services become dependent on data, they also become susceptible to disruptions in data streams, such as data loss due to signal quality reduction or due to power loss during data collection. This paper presents a dynamic network model for improving service resilience to data loss. The network model identifies statistically significant shared temporal trends across multivariate spatiotemporal data streams and utilizes these trends to improve data prediction performance in the case of data loss. Dynamics also allow the system to respond to changes in the data streams such as the loss or addition of new information flows. The network model is demonstrated by city-based crime rates reported in Montgomery County, MD, USA. A resilient network is developed utilizing shared temporal trends between cities to provide improved crime rate prediction and robustness to data loss, compared with the use of single city-based auto-regression. A maximum improvement in performance of 7.8 % for Silver Spring is found and an average improvement of 5.6 % among cities with high crime rates. The model also correctly identifies all the optimal network connections, according to prediction error minimization. City-to-city distance is designated as a predictor of shared temporal trends in crime and weather is shown to be a strong predictor of crime in Montgomery County.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) and 4G/5G wireless networks have added huge number of devices and new services, where commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) IoT devices have been deployed extensively. To ensure secure operations of these systems with wireless transmission capabilities, Radio Frequency (RF) surveillance is important to monitor their activities in RF spectrum and detect unauthorized IoT devices. Specifically, in order to prevent an adversary from impersonating legitimate users using identical devices from the same manufacturer, unique “signatures” must be obtained for every individual device in order to uniquely identify each device. In this study, a novel intrusion detection method is proposed to detect unauthorized IoT devices using deep learning. The proposed method is based on RF fingerprinting since physical layer based features are device specific and more difficult to impersonate. RF traces are collected from six “identical” ZigBee devices via a USRP based test bed. The traces span a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio, to ensure robustness of the model. A convolutional neural network is used to extract features from the RF traces, and dimension reduction and de-correlation are performed on the extracted features. The reduced features are then clustered to identify IoT devices. We show that the proposed method is able to identify devices that are not observed during training. The results not only highlight the benefit of deep learning based feature extraction, but also show promising prospects for being able to distinguish new devices (classes) that are not observed during training.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed rapid progress and significant success in the use of deep learning neural networks (DLNNs) in a wide range of applications. Recently, DLNN has been integrated with intrusion detection system (IDS) to enhance network security to detect zero-day attacks. However, DLNNs themselves have been recently found vulnerable to attacks called adversarial examples and backdoor attacks for image recognition applications. In this work, we present an effective defense method for DLNN based IDS by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the generation of triggers neurons selected based on their response to the features to produce the output. We embed the GA-Trigger-Detection neurons within the model to detect and prevent white-box advertorial examples and backdoor attacks against two DLNNs based IDS: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder Based Extreme Learning Machine (SSAELM). We implement two white-box adversarial examples and backdoor attacks from prior work and use them to investigate the proposed defense method. We show that the defense method is sufficient to defend against sophisticated attackers with 99% success rate and only 1% degrade in accuracy. We then show that it successfully weakens backdoor attacks on the two DNN architectures using two benchmark datasets: KDDCUP'99 and Kyoto. Our work provides an important step toward defenses against white-box advertorial examples and backdoor attacks in DLNNs based IDS.},

abstract={Recent examples have shown that sophisticated cyber attackers are capable of infiltrating the cyber defenses of major organizations and spreading stealthily through a network, potentially doing significant damage before exploited vulnerabilities can be identified or patches developed. Autonomous systems are particularly vulnerable because they are further removed from human intervention. One emerging technology designed to address this problem is proactive reset, where systems automatically undergo a reset operation that restores them to a known malware-free state, regardless of whether or not they were already infected. More frequent resets result in higher security, but may also reduce functionality of the network. In this work, we consider the effectiveness of three proactive reset policies for mitigating the spread of stealthy malware through a network of autonomous systems. We perform experiments using agent-based simulation and find that a proactive policy that uses risk-flow analysis to determine when systems should be reset achieves performance comparable to that of a perfect detector.},

abstract={Increasing situational awareness and investigating the cause of a software-induced cyber attack continues to be one of the most difficult yet important endeavors faced by network security professionals. Traditionally, these forensic pursuits are carried out by manually analyzing the malicious software agents at the heart of the incident, and then observing their interactions in a controlled environment. Both these steps are time consuming and difficult to maintain due to the ever changing nature of malicious software. In this paper we introduce a network science based framework which conducts incident analysis on a dataset by constructing and analyzing relational communities. Construction of these communities is based on the connections of topological features formed when actors communicate with each other. We evaluate our framework using a network trace of the Black Energy malware network, captured by our honey net. We have found that our approach is accurate, efficient, and could prove as a viable alternative to the current status quo.},

abstract={The large datasets are being mined to extract hidden knowledge and patterns that assist decision makers in making effective, efficient, and timely decisions in an ever increasing competitive world. This type of “knowledge-driven” data mining activity is not possible without sharing the “datasets” between their owners and data mining experts (or corporations); as a consequence, protecting ownership (by embedding a watermark) on the datasets is becoming relevant. The most important challenge in watermarking (to be mined) datasets is: how to preserve knowledge in features or attributes? Usually, an owner needs to manually define “Usability constraints” for each type of dataset to preserve the contained knowledge. The major contribution of this paper is a novel formal model that facilitates a data owner to define usability constraints-to preserve the knowledge contained in the dataset-in an automated fashion. The model aims at preserving “classification potential” of each feature and other major characteristics of datasets that play an important role during the mining process of data; as a result, learning statistics and decision-making rules also remain intact. We have implemented our model and integrated it with a new watermark embedding algorithm to prove that the inserted watermark not only preserves the knowledge contained in a dataset but also significantly enhances watermark security compared with existing techniques. We have tested our model on 25 different data-mining datasets to show its efficacy, effectiveness, and the ability to adapt and generalize.},

abstract={There is a growing demand for large-scale distributed storage systems to support resource sharing and fault tolerance. Although heterogeneity issues of distributed systems have been widely investigated, little attention has yet been paid to security solutions designed for distributed storage systems with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. This fact motivates us to investigate a fragment allocation scheme called S-FAS to improve security of a distributed system where storage sites have a wide variety of vulnerabilities. In the S-FAS approach, we integrate file fragmentation with the secret sharing technique in a distributed storage system with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. Storage sites in a distributed systems are classified into a variety of different server types based on vulnerability characteristics. Given a file and a distributed system, S-FAS allocates fragments of the file to as many different types of nodes as possible in the system. Data confidentiality is preserved because fragments of a file are allocated to multiple storage nodes. We develop storage assurance and dynamic assurance models to evaluate the quality of security offered by S-FAS. Analysis results show that fragment allocations made by S-FAS lead to enhanced security because of the consideration of heterogeneous vulnerabilities in distributed storage systems.},

It is important to design new approaches and mechanisms to rise the security these networks and protect them from attacks. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection mechanism for the VANETs using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

abstract={The increasing level of connectivity within vehicles and their environment such as backend or infrastructure increases the risk of potential vulnerabilities regarding information security. In order to minimize these risks, vehicle manufacturers are forced to implement appropriate countermeasures, which are increasingly embedded in approval regulations. As a reactive countermeasure, various approaches to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) exist within the research area to detect attack attempts as early as possible. In this paper, we shift into a new research direction and present an approach for the detection of anomalies in automotive diagnostic applications by using a statistical language model. We analyze incoming diagnostic frames using two different n-gram models (sequence-based and byte-based) to determine whether sequences and the bytes embedded are contextually valid. Since there is currently no publicly available data set of diagnostic data, the detection rate is limited to learned diagnostic uses cases from our own data recordings. Since it is very challenging to generate such a large amount of data, a further enhancement of the approach based on unsupervised learning by using a dynamic anomaly threshold would be promising.},

abstract={In adversarial deep learning, adversarial examples are used to attack the target models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs). The adversarial examples are always constructed by adding vicious perturbations to the original images, and the added perturbations are not easily perceived by human. In order to achieve high attack success rates of adversarial sample, existing attack strategies always increase the magnitudes of global perturbations. However, as the magnitudes are increasing, the attacks will be easily perceived by human. To address this problem, a new approach is proposed to generate adversarial examples with weighted perturbations and abbreviates as WP-AdvGAN. The weights distribution to perturbations are determined by the sensitivity of the target model to the corresponding local region in the adversarial examples. Local region with high sensitivity have greater impacts on the decision of the target model, so the perturbation weights for these regions will be increased in the adversarial sample, vice versa. Experiments performed on MNIST dataset demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed WP-AdvGAN are similar to the original images and have high attack success rates under both white-box and black-box attack settings.},

We avoid the problem of training instability in standard GANs by employing a relativistic discriminator that evaluates how realistic an input image is. Since the reconstructed image quality determines the disparity map's accuracy, we adopt the GMSD, one of the standout IQA algorithms, as a part of the image reconstruction loss function. A VGG-19 pre-trained model-based perceptual loss is used to optimize our model in a feature space instead of pixel space and to enhance reconstructed images' perceptual quality with the learning-based perspective. Also, we add another symmetric generator that takes the right images as input, which helps to maintain the consistency of left/right views and enrich our training data with reasonable overhead on the training time. Our network is trained to predict depths of 640 × 192 images using the KITTI stereo dataset, which shows an outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art works in various evaluation metrics. We verify our method's modules by performing an ablation study and evaluate the generalization performance on CityScapes and Make3D datasets.},

abstract={The advanced persistent threat (APT) as a new kind of cyber attack has posed a severe threat to modern organizations. When the APT has been detected, the organization has to deal with the APT response problem, i.e., to allocate the available response resources to fix her insecure hosts so as to mitigate her potential loss. This paper addresses the APT response problem by using the risk management approach. First, we introduce a model characterizing the evolution of the organization's expected state. By analyzing this model, we find the organization's expected state approaches a common limit expected state. Then, we use the organization's expected loss per unit time to measure her potential loss, and we find this measure is determined by the organization's limit expected state. On this basis, we model the APT response problem as a game-theoretic problem (the APT response game) in which the organization seeks a Nash equilibrium. We present a greedy algorithm for solving the game. Comparative experiments show that the algorithm is effective. Therefore, we recommend the response strategy generated by performing the algorithm. These findings contribute to defending against the APT. To our knowledge, this is the first time the APT response problem is addressed.},

abstract={The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is emerging as a global trend to dramatically enhance the intelligence and efficiency of the industries in recent years. With the emphasis on data communication by IIoT, cyber vulnerabilities are introduced at the same time. As a key subsystem of the industrial automation systems, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is becoming one of the primary targets for cyberattacks in the IIoT paradigm. In this paper, the semi-Markov process (SMP) is employed to model and evaluate the cyberattacks against the SCADA systems considering the insider assistance. Based on the SMP model, the probability distribution of the time-to-compromise the system of the attacks is derived with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Then, a FlipIt game model is developed to investigate the defense and attack strategies of the defender and attacker, and analyze the impacts of the insider assistance. Case studies were carried out to verify the proposed model. The results of the case studies show that the insider assistance will improve the payoff of the attacker and increase the defense action frequency of the system defender. With a high enough defense action frequency, the defender can force the attacker to drop out and eliminate the attack actions.},

Our scheme guides the robot by only adjusting the position of features extracted in the event image plane to their goal positions at a predefined time using smooth time-to-contact trajectories. The proposed scheme is robust, efficient and can be added on top of commonly-used aerial robot velocity controllers.

abstract={This paper presents a computational study of head motion in human interaction, notably of its role in conveying interlocutors' behavioral characteristics. Head motion is physically complex and carries rich information; current modeling approaches based on visual signals, however , are still limited in their ability to adequately capture these important properties. Guided by the methodology of kinesics , we propose a data-driven approach to identify typical head motion patterns. The approach follows the steps of first segmenting motion events, then parametrically representing the motion by linear predictive features, and finally generalizing the motion types using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed approach is experimentally validated using video recordings of communication sessions from real couples involved in a couples therapy study. In particular we use the head motion model to classify binarized expert judgments of the interactants' specific behavioral characteristics where entrainment in head motion is hypothesized to play a role: Acceptance, Blame, Positive, and Negative behavior. We achieve accuracies in the range of 60% to 70% for the various experimental settings and conditions. In addition, we describe a measure of motion similarity between the interaction partners based on the proposed model. We show that the relative change of head motion similarity during the interaction significantly correlates with the expert judgments of the interactants' behavioral characteristics. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed head motion model, and underscore the promise of analyzing human behavioral characteristics through signal processing methods.},

Web services may manage confidential information, monetary transactions, or even health-critical systems, such as those employed in public airports or hospitals. A key problem of web services is that they should work as expected even in the presence of malicious inputs. Unfortunately, with the increasing complexity of web services, this task becomes more and more challenging. In this paper we present SuStorID, a multiple classifier system which is able to model legitimate inputs towards web services, given a sample of web traffic. If anomalous inputs are detected, web services are protected according to a set of anomaly templates. Our experiments, performed on a production environment, highlight that our system can accurately detect web attacks and help security operators to protect their web services against known and unknown attacks.},

However in large-scale networks, the data resulting from such scans can be too numerous for Red Teams to process for manual and semiautomatic testing. Indiscriminate port scans can also compromise a Red Team seeking to quickly gain a foothold on a network. A large attack surface can even complicate Blue Team activities like threat hunting. In this paper we provide a cluster analysis methodology designed to group similar hosts to reduce security team workload and Red Team observability. We also measure the Internet-facing network attack surface of 13 organizations by clustering their hosts based on similarity. Through a case study we demonstrate how the output of our clustering technique provides new insight to both Red and Blue Teams, allowing them to quickly identify potential high-interest points on the attack surface.},

abstract={Power systems become a primary target of cyber attacks because of the vulnerability of the integrated communication networks. An attacker is able to manipulate the integrity of real-time data by maliciously modifying the readings of meters transmitted to the control center. Moreover, it is demonstrated that such attack can escape the bad data detection in state estimation if the topology and network information of the entire power grid is known to the attacker. In this paper, we propose an isolation forest (IF) based detection algorithm as a countermeasure against false data attack (FDA). This method requires no tedious pre-training procedure to obtain the labels of outliers. In addition, comparing with other algorithms, the IF based detection method can find the outliers quickly. The performance of the proposed detection method is verified using the simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus system.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method to detect and identify multiple objects in an image using grid voting of object center positions estimated from local descriptor keypoint matches. For each keypoint match, the proposed method estimates the object center position using scale and orientation associated with the keypoints. Then, it casts a vote for an image grid where the estimated object center is located. For the grids with high number of votes, geometric verification of the keypoint matches is carried out to accurately localize multiple objects in the image. Since the computational complexity of the grid voting is O(n), where n is the number of estimated object centers, the proposed method runs faster than a conventional method using mean shift clustering with O(n2) complexity. Experimental results using images with 52 objects show that the proposed method reduces the computational time by approximately 60% compared to the conventional method, while identification accuracy is comparable. With the reduced computational complexity, industrial applications such as an efficient inventory management in retail using images are enabled in practical computational time.},

abstract={Network evasions can bypass network intrusion detection/prevention systems to deliver exploits, attacks, or malware to victims without being detected. This paper presents a novel method for the detection and recognition of atomic network evasions by the classification of a transmission control protocol (TCP) stream's packet behavior. The syntax for the conversion of TCP streams to codeword streams is proposed to facilitate the extraction of statistical features while preserving the evasion behavior attributes of original network flows. We developed a feature extraction method of employing the normalized term frequencies of codewords to characterize intra and inter packet attribute patterns hidden in actual TCP streams. A TCP stream is then transformed to a fixed length numeric feature vector. Supervised multi-class classifiers are built on the extracted feature vectors to differentiate different types of evasions from normal streams. The quantitative evaluations on an evasion dataset consisting of normal network flows and eight types of atomic evasion flows demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved an encouraging performance with an accuracy of 98.95%.},

abstract={To add more functionality and enhance usability of web applications, JavaScript (JS) is frequently used. Even with many advantages and usefulness of JS, an annoying fact is that many recent cyberattacks such as drive-by-download attacks exploit vulnerability of JS codes. In general, malicious JS codes are not easy to detect, because they sneakily exploit vulnerabilities of browsers and plugin software, and attack visitors of a web site unknowingly. To protect users from such threads, the development of an accurate detection system for malicious JS is soliciting. Conventional approaches often employ signature and heuristic-based methods, which are prone to suffer from zero-day attacks, i.e., causing many false negatives and/or false positives. For this problem, this paper adopts a machine-learning approach to feature learning called Doc2Vec, which is a neural network model that can learn context information of texts. The extracted features are given to a classifier model (e.g., SVM and neural networks) and it judges the maliciousness of a JS code. In the performance evaluation, we use the D3M Dataset (Drive-by-Download Data by Marionette) for malicious JS codes and JSUPACK for benign ones for both training and test purposes. We then compare the performance to other feature learning methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed Doc2Vec features provide better accuracy and fast classification in malicious JS code detection compared to conventional approaches.},

abstract={This paper proposes a systematic analysis method for 5G Non-Access Stratum Signalling security based on formal analysis, which has identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities, and an improved PKI security mechanism targeted at eliminating these vulnerabilities. Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an attacker's behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G. Besides the existing public-private key pair of the home network, we introduce a new pair of asymmetric keys in the gNodeB to encrypt and sign the signalling message sent to UE. The gNodeB can be connected only when the verification succeeds and then the RRC connection can be initiated. This mechanism can effectively avoid all the vulnerabilities found in this paper.},

Existing defenses focus on using the social graph structure to isolate fakes.

In this paper, we present VoteTrust, a scalable defense system that further leverages user-level activities. VoteTrust models the friend invitation interactions among users as a directed, signed graph, and uses two key mechanisms to detect Sybils over the graph: a voting-based Sybil detection to find Sybils that users vote to reject, and a Sybil community detection to find other colluding Sybils around identified Sybils. Through evaluating on Renren social network, we show that VoteTrust is able to prevent Sybils from generating many unsolicited friend requests. We also deploy VoteTrust in Renen, and our real experience demonstrates that VoteTrust can detect large-scale collusion among Sybils.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose techniques for detecting anomalies in user accesses by learning profiles of normal access patterns of users based on both the syntactic and semantic features of past users queries stored in database logs. New accesses are checked upon these profiles and deviations are considered anomalous accesses which may be indications of potential insider attacks. We consider two scenarios. The first scenario is when the monitored database employs role-based access control (RBAC). In this scenario, we build profiles of roles rather than individual users, this makes our approach usable for databases which have a large user population. In this case, we use the naive Bayesian classification to detect anomalies. We also employ multilabeling classification to account for the case when roles have common access patterns. The second scenario is when RBAC is not used. In this case, we detect anomalies using the COBWEB clustering algorithm. We provide extensive evaluation for our techniques. Results show that our techniques are effective.},

abstract={The use of smartphone applications based on the Android OS platform is rapidly growing among smartphone users. However, malicious apps for Android are being developed to perform attacks, such as destroying operating systems, stealing confidential data, gathering personal information, and hijacking or encrypting sensitive data. Several malware detection systems based on machine learning have been developed and deployed to extract a variety of features to prevent such attacks. However, new efficient detection methods are needed to extract complex features and hidden structures from malicious apps to detect malware. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely, MalResLSTM, based on deep residual long short-term memory to identify and classify malware variants. The framework imposes a set of constraints on the deep learning architecture to capture dependencies between the extracted features from the Android package kit (APK) file. These feature sets are mapped to a vector space to process the input sequence using a sequence model based on the residual LSTM network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, several experiments are conducted on the Drebin dataset, which contains 129,013 applications. The results demonstrate that MalResLSTM can achieve a 99.32% detection accuracy and outperforms previous algorithms. An extensive experimental analysis was conducted, which included machine-learning-based algorithms and a variety of deep learning-based algorithms, to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed framework.},

abstract={The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.},

abstract={Speech enhancement and separation are core problems in audio signal processing, with commercial applications in devices as diverse as mobile phones, conference call systems, hands-free systems, or hearing aids. In addition, they are crucial preprocessing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multichannel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These communities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing a large number of established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: 1) the acoustic impulse response model, 2) the spatial filter design criterion, 3) the parameter estimation algorithm, and 4) optional postfiltering. We conclude this overview paper by providing a list of software and data resources and by discussing perspectives and future trends in the field.},

Theoretical results show that basic reproductive ratio is significantly dependent on diverse software packages and the network topology. The installation of diverse software packages on nodes leads to decrease reproductive ratio and malware spreading. The results of numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract={This paper reviews the background and related studies in the areas of cloud systems, intrusion detection and blockchain applications against cyber attacks. This work aims to discuss collaborative anomaly detection systems for discovering insider and outsider attacks from cloud centres, including the technologies of virtualisation and containerisation, along with trusting intrusion detection and cloud systems using blockchain. Moreover, the ability to detect such malicious attacks is critical for conducting necessary mitigation, at an early stage, to minimise the impact of disruption and restore cloud operations and their live migration processes. This paper presents an overview of cloud architecture and categorises potential state-of-the-art security events based on their occurrence at different cloud deployment models. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) in the cloud, involving types of classification and common detection approaches, are also described. Collaborative NIDSs for cloud-based blockchain applications are also explained to demonstrate how blockchain can address challenges related to data privacy and trust management. A summary of the research challenges and future research directions in these fields is also explained.},

abstract={Physical layer security (PLS) technologies have attracted much attention in recent years for their potential to provide information-theoretically secure communications. Artificial Noise (AN)-aided transmission is considered as one of the most practicable PLS technologies, as it can realize secure transmission independent of the eavesdropper's channel status. In this paper, we reveal that AN transmission has the dependency of eavesdropper's channel condition by introducing our proposed attack method based on a supervised-learning algorithm which utilizes the modulation scheme, available from known packet preamble and/or header information, as supervisory signals of training data. Numerical simulation results with the comparison to conventional clustering methods show that our proposed method improves the success probability of attack from 4.8% to at most 95.8% for the QPSK modulation. It implies that the transmission to the receiver in the cell-edge with low order modulation will be cracked if the eavesdropper's channel is good enough by employing more antennas than the transmitter. This work brings new insights into the effectiveness of AN schemes and provides useful guidance for the design of robust PLS techniques for practical wireless systems.},

abstract={Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) are one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Given the continuous distribution of IoT devices, data confidentiality and user privacy are of utmost importance. However, with the growing complexity of SoCs, the risk of malware infections and trojans introduced at design time increases significantly. A vital threat to system security are so-called side-channel attacks based on cache observations. While mainly studied on desktop and server systems, recent publications have analyzed cache attacks on mobile devices and network-on-chip platforms. In this work, we investigate cache attacks on System-on-Chips implementing bus based communication. To this end, we present two contributions. First, we demonstrate an improved Prime+Probe based cache attack on AES-128 that, for the first time, exploits the bus communication to increase its efficiency. Second, we integrate two countermeasures (Shuffling and Mini-table) and evaluate their impact on the attack. The results show that our improved attack recovers the full key twice as fast as Prime+Probe without exploiting bus communication. Moreover, we propose protection techniques that are feasible and effectively mitigate both original and improved attack.},

abstract={Almost all adversarial attacks in computer vision are aimed at pre-known object categories, which could be offline trained for generating perturbations. But as for visual object tracking, the tracked target categories are normally unknown in advance. However, the tracking algorithms also have potential risks of being attacked, which could be maliciously used to fool the surveillance systems. Meanwhile, it is still a challenging task that adversarial attacks on tracking since it has the free-model tracked target. Therefore, to help draw more attention to the potential risks, we study adversarial attacks on tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot adversarial attack method to generate adversarial examples for free-model single object tracking, where merely adding slight perturbations on the target patch in the initial frame causes state-of-the-art trackers to lose the target in subsequent frames. Specifically, the optimization objective of the proposed attack consists of two components and leverages the dual attention mechanisms. The first component adopts a targeted attack strategy by optimizing the batch confidence loss with confidence attention while the second one applies a general perturbation strategy by optimizing the feature loss with channel attention. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly lower the accuracy of the most advanced Siamese network-based trackers on three benchmarks.},

pages={1069-1083},
abstract={The shrew distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is very detrimental for many applications, since it can throttle TCP flows to a small fraction of their ideal rate at very low attack cost. Earlier works mainly focused on empirical studies of defending against the shrew DDoS, and very few of them provided analytic results about the attack itself. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for estimating attack effect of this stealthy type of DDoS. By originally capturing the adjustment behaviors of victim TCPs congestion window, our model can comprehensively evaluate the combined impact of attack pattern (i.e., how the attack is configured) and network environment on attack effect (the existing models failed to consider the impact of network environment). Henceforth, our model has higher accuracy over a wider range of network environments. The relative error of our model remains around 10% for most attack patterns and network environments, whereas the relative error of the benchmark model in previous works has a mean value of 69.57%, and it could be more than 180% in some cases. More importantly, our model reveals some novel properties of the shrew attack from the interaction between attack pattern and network environment, such as the minimum cost formula to launch a successful attack, and the maximum effect formula of a shrew attack. With them, we are able to find out how to adaptively tune the attack parameters (e.g., the DoS burst length) to improve its attack effect in a given network environment, and how to reconfigure the network resource (e.g., the bottleneck buffer size) to mitigate the shrew DDoS with a given attack pattern. Finally, based on our theoretical results, we put forward a simple strategy to defend the shrew attack. The simulation results indicate that this strategy can remarkably increase TCP throughput by nearly half of the bottleneck bandwidth (and can be higher) for general attack patterns.},

In detail, we adapt a generator from the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to increase the size of training dataset, which includes a base set, a widely available dataset, and a novel set, a given limited dataset, while adopting transfer learning as a backend. Based on extensive experimental study, we conduct the analysis on various data augmentation methods, observing how each affects the identification accuracy.

The traditional intrusion detection system has been challenged tremendously, and it is unable to detect the new types of attacks. This paper proposes an intrusion detection model based on deepFM, which combines the advantages of FM algorithm for processing shallow features and the advantages of deep neural network for processing deep features, which can effectively extract features and classify them. We then performed experiments using the KDD CUP 99 dataset. First, the training set is deduplicated and oversampled to balance various types of samples, and then the processed data is used for training. Then optimize tuning parameters and find an optimal model. Finally, use the best model to make predictions on the test set. On the test set, we got a correct rate of 0.934 and a COST value of 0.191. By analyzing the results and comparing existing studies, we can conclude that the model proposed in this paper has a good effect on KDD 99 CUP and has certain practical value.},

abstract={Social media networks have shown rapid growth in the past, and massive social data are generated which can reveal behavior or emotion propensities of users. Numerous social researchers leverage machine learning technology to build social media analytic models which can detect the abnormal behaviors or mental illnesses from the social media data effectively. Although the researchers only public the prediction interfaces of the machine learning models, in general, these interfaces may leak information about the individual data records on which the models were trained. Knowing a certain user's social media record was used to train a model can breach user privacy. In this paper, we present SocInf and focus on the fundamental problem known as membership inference. The key idea of SocInf is to construct a mimic model which has a similar prediction behavior with the public model, and then we can disclose the prediction differences between the training and testing data set by abusing the mimic model. With elaborated analytics on the predictions of the mimic model, SocInf can thus infer whether a given record is in the victim model's training set or not. We empirically evaluate the attack performance of SocInf on machine learning models trained by Xgboost, logistics, and online cloud platform. Using the realistic data, the experiment results show that SocInf can achieve an inference accuracy and precision of 73% and 84%, respectively, in average, and of 83% and 91% at best.},

abstract={For a variety of cyber-attacks occurring in a power IoT-Cloud environment, conventional security intrusion incident detection and response technologies typically use pattern- and behavior-based statistical methods. However, they cannot provide fundamental solutions for a security intrusion or attacks, which are becoming more intelligent and diverse as time passes. Therefore, an effective response method that can respond to security intrusions intelligently while using an access control technique based on ontology reasoning is required. This can be achieved by adopting a variety of intelligent reasoning technologies for security intrusion incidents of power systems, such as various reasoning technologies based on the ontology and semantic-web technologies being actively studied in the field of intelligent systems, and malicious code detection technologies based on an intelligent access control model, text mining, and natural language processing technologies. Accordingly, a security context ontology was modeled by analyzing the security vulnerabilities of a power system in a power IoT-Cloud environment, and security context inference rules were defined. Furthermore, this paper presents an appropriate power IoT-Cloud security service framework that can be used in a power IoT-Cloud environment. In addition, a security mechanism that can be efficiently operated in such an environment is implemented. In experiments conducted for this application, attack context scenarios that commonly occur were created using a smart meter as an example, which is an essential power system device. Inference rules were then composed for each attack stage to check the paths of attacks those that exploit the vulnerability of a smart meter system. As a result, it was confirmed that a high level attack detection results can be obtained based on the inference rules.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly significant role in our daily activities, connecting physical objects around us into digital services. In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.},

Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F1 score of respectively > 99%.},

abstract={Honeypots are deployed to capture cyber attack data for analysis of attacker behavior. This paper analyses a honeypot dataset to establish attack types and corresponding temporal patterns. It calculates the probability of each attack type occurring at a particular time of day and tests these probabilities with a random sample from the honeypot dataset. Attacks can take many forms and can come from different geographical sources. Temporal patterns in attacks are often observed due to the diurnal nature of computer usage and thus attack types captured on a honeypot will also reflect these patterns. We propose that it is possible to determine the probability of differing attack types occurring at certain times of the day. Understanding attack behavior informs the implementation of more robust security measures. The paper also proposes automating this process to create dynamic and adaptive honeypots. An adaptive honeypot that can modify its security levels, can increase the attack vector at different times of the day. This will improve data collection for analysis that ultimately will lead to better cyber defenses.},

abstract={In order to address two main limitations of current content-based music recommendation approaches, an ordinal regression algorithm for music recommendation that incorporates dynamic information is presented. Instead of assuming that local spectral features within a song are identically and independently distributed examples of an underlying probability density, music is characterized by a vocabulary of acoustic segment models (ASMs), which are found with an unsupervised process. Further, instead of classifying music based on subjective classes, such as genre, or trying to find a universal notion of similarity, songs are classified based on personal preference ratings. The ordinal regression approach to perform the ratings prediction is based on the discriminative-training algorithm known as minimum classification error (MCE) training. Experimental results indicate that improved temporal modeling leads to superior performance over standard spectral-based music representations. Further, the MCE-based preference ratings algorithm is shown to be superior over two other systems. Analysis demonstrates that the superior performance is due to MCE being a non-conservative algorithm that demonstrates immunity to outliers.},

abstract={Recent research has provided evidence indicating how a malicious user could perform coresidence profiling and public-to-private IP mapping to target and exploit customers which share physical resources. The attacks rely on two steps: resource placement on the target's physical machine and extraction. Our proposed solution, in part inspired by mussel self-organization, relies on user account and workload clustering to mitigate coresidence profiling. Users with similar preferences and workload characteristics are mapped to the same cluster. To obfuscate the public-to-private IP map, each cluster is managed and accessed by an account proxy. Each proxy uses one public IP address, which is shared by all clustered users when accessing their instances, and maintains the mapping to private IP addresses. We describe a set of capabilities and attack paths an attacker needs to execute for targeted coresidence, and present arguments to show how our approach disrupts the critical steps in the attack path for most cases. We then perform a risk assessment to determine the likelihood an individual user will be victimized, given that a successful nondirected exploit has occurred. Our results suggest that while possible, this event is highly unlikely.},

Then, we present a new structure-based training regime to enable different entities learn task-specific and reconstruction-proof image representations for image data sharing. Specifically, each entity learns a private Deep Poisoning Module (DPM) and insert it to a pre-trained deep network, which is designed to perform the specific vision task. The DPM deliberately poisons convolutional image features to prevent image reconstructions, while ensuring that the altered image data is functionally equivalent to the non-poisoned data for the specific vision task. Given this equivalence, the poisoned features shared from one entity could be used by another entity for further model refinement. Experimental results on image classification prove the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Various frameworks and techniques have been developed to solve the problem of intrusion detection, still there is need for new frameworks as per the challenging scenario of enormous scale in data size and nature of attacks. Current IDS systems pose challenges on the throughput to work with high speed networks. In this paper we address the issue of high computational overhead of anomaly based IDS and propose the solution using discretization as a data preprocessing step which can drastically reduce the computation overhead. We propose method to provide near real time detection of attacks using only basic flow level features that can easily be extracted from network packets.},

abstract={Machine learning systems have had enormous success in a wide range of fields from computer vision, natural language processing, and anomaly detection. However, such systems are vulnerable to attackers who can cause deliberate misclassification by introducing small perturbations. With machine learning systems being proposed for cyber attack detection such attackers are cause for serious concern. Despite this the vast majority of adversarial machine learning security research is focused on the image domain. This work gives a brief overview of adversarial machine learning and machine learning used in cyber attack detection and suggests key differences between the traditional image domain of adversarial machine learning and the cyber domain. Finally we show an adversarial machine learning attack on an industrial control system.},

abstract={In this paper, we use hyper-network methods to identify the critical elements of a cyber-physical system (CPS) under data attack according to IEC 61850. The related works are introduced first, such as cyber offensive tools, procedures, and data attack models. Some definitions of a hypergraph are presented. Then, considering the functional attributes of logical nodes, a hyper-network model of substation auto system (SAS) is proposed using hyper-graph theory. On this basis, a CPS model that takes into account the functional influence after data attack is established. In addition, combined with the analysis of the network model, the efficiency indexes are given to evaluate the effectiveness of the CPS under data attack. The reasons why we choose these indexes in network and hyper-network model are also explained. Finally, the analysis in the case study illustrates that the method proposed is helpful for identifying critical elements of the CPS, which provides a new avenue for future vulnerability analysis research.},

abstract={As more and more cloud services are exposed to DDoS attacks, DDoS attack detect has become a new challenging task because large packet traces captured on fast links could not be easily handled on a single server with limited computing and memory resources. In this paper, we propose a Hadoop based model to identify abnormal packets and compute the statistics according to the number of abnormal packets. The novelties of the model are that:(1) by harnessing HBASE, an improved bloom filter based mapping mechanism named TCP2HC/UDP2HC are implemented, (2)with the characteristics of IP spoofing and the temporal correlation of transport layer connection state, an extensible set of rules and a reliable MapReduce based checking mechanism for abnormal packets are designed, (3) using statistic features extracted from the increased abnormal packets and TCP/UDP flow, a non-parameter CUSUM algorithm is used to detect most DDoS attacks accurately and efficiently. The model can detect the attack behavior in the early stage, which is beneficial to mitigate attack with the help of flow cleaning by converting a check rule to the filtering rule. Experiments show no matter how large the attack scale and what kind of DDoS attack, the detection model can soon detect DDoS attack accurately.},

abstract={When filling out privacy-related forms in public places such as hospitals or clinics, people usually are not aware that the sound of their handwriting leaks personal information. In this paper, we explore the possibility of eavesdropping on handwriting via nearby mobile devices based on audio signal processing and machine learning. By presenting a proof-of-concept system, WritingHacker, we show the usage of mobile devices to collect the sound of victims' handwriting, and to extract handwriting-specific features for machine learning based analysis. WritingHacker focuses on the situation where the victim's handwriting follows certain print style. An attacker can keep a mobile device, such as a common smartphone, touching the desk used by the victim to record the audio signals of handwriting. Then, the system can provide a word-level estimate for the content of the handwriting. To reduce the impacts of various writing habits and writing locations, the system utilizes the methods of letter clustering, dictionary filtering and letter time length based offsetting. Moreover, if the relative position between the device and the handwriting is known, a hand motion tracking method can be further applied to enhance the system's performance. Our prototype system's experimental results show that the accuracy of word recognition reaches around 70 - 80 percent under certain conditions, which reveals the danger of privacy leakage through the sound of handwriting.},

abstract={Nowadays, from information security perspective, detection methods are not enough solely. Intrusion Detection and Response Systems (IDRS), as a proactive solution, continuously monitor system health based on Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts, so that malicious activities can be handled effectively by applying appropriate countermeasures to prevent problems from worsening and return the system to a healthy state. In this paper, a novel IDRS is proposed which processes the generated alerts in real time, correlates the alerts, calculates the risk of correlated alerts and models the attack scenarios and their countermeasures using the concept of Bayesian decision networks (BDNs). The proposed framework has two modes: online and offline. In the offline mode, a BDN model is constructed. Then, in the online mode, using the generated BDN, the next probable intentions of attackers are predicted and the optimal sets of countermeasures are identified to prevent the attackers reaching their goals. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the security level of computer systems in terms of forecasting the multi-step attacks before they can compromise the network and determining the optimal security risk mitigation plans to prevent damages to the organizations assets.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition systems to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints. MasterPrints are real or synthetic fingerprints that can fortuitously match with a large number of fingerprints thereby undermining the security afforded by fingerprint systems. Previous work by Roy et al. generated synthetic MasterPrints at the feature-level. In this work we generate complete image-level MasterPrints known as DeepMasterPrints, whose attack accuracy is found to be much superior than that of previous methods. The proposed method, referred to as Latent Variable Evolution, is based on training a Generative Adversarial Network on a set of real fingerprint images. Stochastic search in the form of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy is then used to search for latent input variables to the generator network that can maximize the number of impostor matches as assessed by a fingerprint recognizer. Experiments convey the efficacy of the proposed method in generating DeepMasterPrints. The underlying method is likely to have broad applications in fingerprint security as well as fingerprint synthesis.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides us with the capability of collecting network traffic information and managing networks proactively. Therefore, SDN facilitates the promotion of more robust and secure networks. Recently, several Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) intrusion detection approaches have been proposed to secure SDN networks. Currently, most of the proposed ML/DL intrusion detection approaches are based on supervised learning approach that required labelled and well-balanced datasets for training. However, this is time intensive and require significant human expertise to curate these datasets. These approaches cannot deal well with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we propose a hybrid unsupervised DL approach using the stack autoencoder and One-class Support Vector Machine (SAE-1SVM) for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average accuracy of 99.35 % with a small set of flow features. The SAE-1SVM shows that it can reduce the processing time significantly while maintaining a high detection rate. In summary, the SAE-1SVM can work well with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets and yield a high detection accuracy.},

abstract={Iris recognition systems transform an iris image into a feature vector. The seminal pipeline segments an image into iris and non-iris pixels, normalizes this region into a fixed-dimension rectangle, and extracts features which are stored and called a template (Daugman, 2009). This template is stored on a system. A future reading of an iris can be transformed and compared against template vectors to determine or verify the identity of an individual. As templates are often stored together, they are a valuable target to an attacker. We show how to invert templates across a variety of iris recognition systems. Our inversion is based on a convolutional neural network architecture we call RESIST (REconStructing IriSes from Templates). We apply RESIST to a traditional Gabor filter pipeline, to a DenseNet (Huang etal., CVPR 2017) feature extractor, and to a DenseNet architecture that works without normalization. Both DenseNet feature extractors are based on the recent ThirdEye recognition system (Ahmad and Fuller, BTAS 2019). When training and testing using the ND-0405 dataset, reconstructed images demonstrate a rank-1 accuracy of 100%, 76%, and 96% respectively for the three pipelines. The core of our approach is similar to an autoencoder. To obtain high accuracy this core is integrated into an adversarial network (Goodfellow et al., NeurIPS, 2014).},

abstract={Smart grids rely on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to monitor and control complex electrical networks in order to provide reliable energy to homes and industries. However, the increased inter-connectivity and remote accessibility of SCADA systems expose them to cyber attacks. As a consequence, developing effective security mechanisms is a priority in order to protect the network from internal and external attacks. We propose an integrated framework for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for smart grids which combines feature engineering-based preprocessing with machine learning classifiers. Whilst most of the machine learning techniques fine-tune the hyper-parameters to improve the detection rate, our approach focuses on selecting the most promising features of the dataset using Gradient Boosting Feature Selection (GBFS) before applying the classification algorithm, a combination which improves not only the detection rate but also the execution speed. GBFS uses the Weighted Feature Importance (WFI) extraction technique to reduce the complexity of classifiers. We implement and evaluate various decision-tree based machine learning techniques after obtaining the most promising features of the power grid dataset through a GBFS module, and show that this approach optimizes the False Positive Rate (FPR) and the execution time.},

abstract={Due to the constrained resource and computational limitation of many Internet of Things (IoT) devices, conventional security protections, which require high computational overhead are not suitable to be deployed. Thus, vulnerable IoT devices could be easily exploited by attackers to break into networks. In this paper, we employ cyber deception and moving target defense (MTD) techniques to proactively change the network topology with both real and decoy nodes with the support of software-defined networking (SDN) technology and investigate the impact of single-target and multi-target attacks on the effectiveness of the integrated mechanism via a hierarchical graphical security model with security metrics. We also implement a web-based visualization interface to show topology changes with highlighted attack paths. Finally, the qualitative security analysis is performed for a small-scale and SDN-supported IoT network with different combinations of decoy types and levels of attack intelligence. Simulation results show the integrated defense mechanism can introduce longer mean-time-to-security-failure and larger attack impact under the multi-target attack, compared with the single-target attack model. In addition, adaptive shuffling has better performance than fixed interval shuffling in terms of a higher proportion of decoy paths, longer mean-time-to-security-failure and largely reduced defense cost.},

abstract={Moderation of user-generated content in an online community is a challenge that has great socio-economic ramifications. However, the costs incurred by delegating this paper to human agents are high. For this reason, an automatic system able to detect abuse in user-generated content is of great interest. There are a number of ways to tackle this problem, but the most commonly seen in practice are word filtering or regular expression matching. The main limitations are their vulnerability to intentional obfuscation on the part of the users, and their context-insensitive nature. Moreover, they are language dependent and may require appropriate corpora for training. In this paper, we propose a system for automatic abuse detection that completely disregards message content. We first extract a conversational network from raw chat logs and characterize it through topological measures. We then use these as features to train a classifier on our abuse detection task. We thoroughly assess our system on a dataset of user comments originating from a French massively multiplayer online game. We identify the most appropriate network extraction parameters and discuss the discriminative power of our features, relatively to their topological and temporal nature. Our method reaches an F -measure of 83.89 when using the full feature set, improving on existing approaches. With a selection of the most discriminative features, we dramatically cut computing time while retaining the most of the performance (82.65).},

How to evaluate the security defense system quantitatively and optimize the deployment of devices, becomes an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming at these problems above, a security defense evaluation method of internal network based on the traffic of devices is proposed. This method quantifies the defense effectiveness, it realizes the objective evaluation on defense effectiveness from two dimensions. One is the severity of potential attack risk, another is the response of a device with defense function. In practical application, this method can evaluate the effectiveness of defense scheme under different application scenes and different security risk defining standards. It doesn't need modeling and analysis for special context separately, and it can evaluate the effectiveness of system's defense strategy quantitatively. Comparing with the method which security staff simulate attack behaviors by penetration testing, this method is more comprehensive and controllable. It is helpful to confirm the relationship between network security device and protected asset, the relationship between security threat and defense, and the relationship between security devices and whole defense system. Through analyzing the evaluation result, the efficiency of the evaluation method of the security defense capability of internal network is proved.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a novel paradigm as more and more devices are connected to the Internet, enabling several innovative applications such as smart home, industrial automation, and connected health. However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home's traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.},

abstract={This paper presents a system for detecting intrusions when analyzing the network traffic payload looking for malware evidences. The system implements the detection algorithm as a Snort preprocessor component. Since they work together, a highly effective system against known attacks has been achieved (based on Snort rules) and a highly effective system against unknown threats (which was the main aim of the designed system). As the majority of such systems, the proposal consists of two phases: a training phase and a detection phase. During the training phase a statistical model of the legitimate network usage is created through Bloom Filters and N-grams techniques. Subsequently, the results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks are compared with such model. This will allow a set of rules to be developed which will be able to determine whether the packets payloads contain malware. In the detection phase, the traffic to analyze is compared with the model created in the training phase and the results obtained when applying rules. The performed experiments showed really satisfactory results, with 100% malware detection and just 0.15% false positives.},

In essence, residual register values and shared local memory in the iGPU are not cleared during a context switch. As a result, adversaries can recover the secret key of a cryptographic algorithm running on an iGPU from a single snapshot of the leaking channel. User privacy is also under threat due to browser activity eavesdropping through website-fingerprinting attack with high accuracy and resolution.

Randomization and data-dependencies (DD) are utilized to hide information leakage from the current dissipation, and hence making the critical synchronization of power supply current traces hard to do. In addition, randomization and DD are utilized for both time-domain hiding of information leakage during the active region (dynamic currents) and for amplitude-domain hiding of information leakage during the static-region (leakage currents). The main advantages of this new approach are low area cost, reduced signal, and increased noise. Circuit-level analyses show that it is harder to exploit the information leakage from internal signals of the proposed design than from CMOS-based synchronous designs or other forms of time-domain hiding countermeasures.},

abstract={Critical infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been designed to operate on closed, proprietary networks where a malicious insider posed the greatest threat potential. The centralization of control and the movement towards open systems and standards has improved the efficiency of industrial control, but has also exposed legacy SCADA systems to security threats that they were not designed to mitigate. This work explores the viability of machine learning methods in detecting the new threat scenarios of command and data injection. Similar to network intrusion detection systems in the cyber security domain, the command and control communications in a critical infrastructure setting are monitored, and vetted against examples of benign and malicious command traffic, in order to identify potential attack events. Multiple learning methods are evaluated using a dataset of Remote Terminal Unit communications, which included both normal operations and instances of command and data injection attack scenarios.},

abstract={First-order and high-order correlation-power-analysis attacks have been shown to be a severe threat to cryptographic devices. As such, they serve as a security measure for evaluation and comparison of security-oriented implementations. When properly designed, data-dependent delays can be used as a barrier to these attacks. This paper introduces a security-oriented delay assignment algorithm for mitigating single and multibit attacks. The algorithm enables a reduction of the correlation between the processed data and the consumed current by utilizing the data-dependent delays as a source of correlated noise. This is done while minimizing the area overhead, propagation time, and power. We show that for the same security level this new algorithm provides X2 and X6 more area efficiency, and X1.5 and X2.25 higher frequencies than a permuted path delay assignment and random embedding of delay elements.},

abstract={Audio watermarking plays an important role in copyright protection. Echo hiding, one of the most effective techniques for audio watermarking, has been studied for decades. However, the conventional echo hiding has been criticized for its weak security, as watermarks can be easily extracted by means of cepstrum analysis even without any prior knowledge. This article explores the time-frequency (T-F) characteristics of the repetition structures in an audio signal to improve the security of conventional echo hiding. In our approach, the original audio signal is first converted into a high-dimensional T-F representation, and then by clustering the time frames that have similar T-F characteristics into the same subspace, the original audio is decomposed into a union of subspaces with each corresponding to one time-domain subsignal. Paired and opposite echo kernels are applied to energy-balanced subsignals for watermark embedding, which significantly improves the security. In the watermark extraction process, the subspaces are recovered on the basis of the T-F similarities and cepstrum analysis is utilized to extract watermarks. The proposed embedding and extraction schemes thus offer a new approach for echo hiding. The results of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with respect to inaudibility, security, and robustness.},

abstract={Side-channel attacks constitute a concrete threat to IoT systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). Embedded memories implemented with 6T SRAM macrocells often dominate the area and power consumption of these SoCs. Regardless of the computational platform, the side-channel sensitivity of low-hierarchy cache memories can incur significant overhead to protect the memory content (i.e., data encryption, data masking, etc.). In this manuscript, we provide a silicon proof of the effectiveness of a low cost side-channel attack protection that is embedded within the memory macro to achieve a significant reduction in information leakage. The proposed solution incorporates low-cost impedance randomization units, which are integrated into the periphery of a conventional 6T SRAM macro in fine-grain memory partitions, providing possible protection against electromagnetic adversaries. Various blocks of unprotected and protected SRAM macros were designed and fabricated in a 55 nm test-chip. The protected ones had little as 1% area overhead and less than 5% performance and power penalties compared to a conventional SRAM design. To evaluate the security of the proposed solution, we applied a robust mutual information metric and an adaptation to the memory context to enhance this evaluation framework. Assessment of the protected memory demonstrated a significant information leakage reduction from 8 bits of information exposed after only 100 cycles of attack to less than ~1.5 bits of mutual information after 160K traces. The parametric nature of the protection mechanisms are discussed while specifying the proposed design parameters. Overall, the proposed methodology enables designs with higher security-level at a minimal cost.},

abstract={Bidirectional communication infrastructure of smart systems, such as smart grids, are vulnerable to network attacks like distributed denial of services (DDoS) and can be a major concern in the present competitive market. In DDoS attack, multiple compromised nodes in a communication network flood connection requests, bogus data packets or incoming messages to targets like database servers, resulting in denial of services for legitimate users. Recently, machine learning based techniques have been explored by researchers to secure the network from DDoS attacks. Under different attack scenarios on a system, measurements can be observed either in an online manner or batch mode and can be used to build predictive learning systems. In this work, we propose an efficient DDoS attack detection technique based on multilevel auto-encoder based feature learning. We learn multiple levels of shallow and deep auto-encoders in an unsupervised manner which are then used to encode the training and test data for feature generation. A final unified detection model is then learned by combining the multilevel features using and efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm. We perform experiments on two benchmark DDoS attack databases and their subsets and compare the results with six recent methods. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the security assessment of electricity distribution networks (DNs) with vulnerable distributed energy resource (DER) nodes. The adversary model is a simultaneous compromise of DER nodes by strategic manipulation of generation setpoints. The loss to the defender (DN operator) includes loss of voltage regulation and cost of induced load control under supply-demand mismatch caused by the attack. A three-stage defender-attacker-defender (DAD) game is formulated: in Stage 1, the defender chooses a security strategy to secure a subset of DER nodes; in Stage 2, the attacker compromises a set of vulnerable DERs and injects false generation setpoints; in Stage 3, the defender responds by controlling loads and non-compromised DERs. Solving this trilevel optimization problem is hard due to nonlinear power flows and mixed-integer decision variables. To address this challenge, the problem is approximated by a tractable formulation based on an ε-linear power-flow model. The set of critical DER nodes and the setpoint manipulations characterizing the optimal attack strategy are computed. An iterative greedy approach to computing attacker-defender strategies for the original nonlinear problem is proposed. These results provide guidelines for optimal security investment and defender response in preattack and postattack conditions, respectively.},

year={2020},
volume={7},
number={9},
pages={8218-8227},
abstract={State estimation is critical to the monitoring and control of smart grids. Recently, the false data injection attack (FDIA) is emerging as a severe threat to state estimation. Conventional FDIA detection approaches are limited by their strong statistical knowledge assumptions, complexity, and hardware cost. Moreover, most of the current FDIA detection approaches focus on detecting the presence of FDIA, while the important information of the exact injection locations is not attainable. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, we propose a deep-learning-based locational detection architecture (DLLD) to detect the exact locations of FDIA in real time. The DLLD architecture concatenates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a standard bad data detector (BDD). The BDD is used to remove the low-quality data. The followed CNN, as a multilabel classifier, is employed to capture the inconsistency and co-occurrence dependency in the power flow measurements due to the potential attacks. The proposed DLLD is “model-free” in the sense that it does not leverage any prior statistical assumptions. It is also “cost-friendly” in the sense that it does not alter the current BDD system and the runtime of the detection process is only hundreds of microseconds on a household computer. Through extensive experiments in the IEEE bus systems, we show that DLLD can perform locational detection precisely under various noise and attack conditions. In addition, we also demonstrate that the employed multilabel classification approach effectively enhances the presence-detection accuracy.},

abstract={Shader lamps can augment physical objects with projected virtual replications using a camera-projector system, provided that the physical and virtual object are well registered to each other. Precise registration and tracking has been a cumbersome and intrusive process in the past. In this paper, we present a new method for tracking complex-shaped physical objects interactively. In contrast to previous approaches our system is mobile and makes solely use of the projection of the virtual replication to track the physical object and “stick” the projection to it. Our method consists of two stages, a fast pose initialization based on structured light patterns and a non-intrusive frame-by-frame tracking based on features detected in the projection. During the tracking phase, a radiometrically corrected virtual camera view based on the current pose prediction is rendered and compared to the captured image. Matched features are triangulated providing a sparse set of surface points that is robustly aligned to the virtual model. The alignment transformation serves as an input for the new pose prediction. Detailed experiments including the evaluation of the overlay accuracy show that our approach can accurately and robustly track complex objects at interactive rates.},

abstract={Traditionally, dynamic detection approaches to Malware identification are commended for their simplicity and small sized signature database. In practice they suffer from two major defects. First, Malware might need to be emulated for a long time before traces of harmful behavior are first exhibited. Second, a few Anti-VM techniques are widely known and can be easily employed by any program to thwart the attempt of having it executed in a sandbox and observe its original behavior, rendering the approach less than effective. On the other hand, static detection approaches, have their own limitations, ranging from parsing obfuscated executables to the scalability issues due to the ever-increasing size of the signature database. Fundamentally, in the last 10-15 years polymorphic and metamorphic obfuscation techniques have become prevalent making static approaches less than effective due to the sheer magnitude of the sample set1. While the benefits of either dynamic or static approaches look quite tempting from each of their counterparts perspectives, their weakness are daunting in their own sight as well. In this manuscript we attempted to combine the best part of both worlds, without bringing in the disadvantage of either of them. We call this mixed approach “Segmented Sandboxing”.},

abstract={Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) are currently evolving in the form of a cooperative ITS or connected vehicles. Both forms use the data communications between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I/I2V) and other on-road entities, and are accelerating the adoption of self-driving cars. The development of cyber-physical systems containing advanced sensors, sub-systems, and smart driving assistance applications over the past decade is equipping unmanned aerial and road vehicles with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The level of autonomy depends upon the make-up and degree of sensor sophistication and the vehicle's operational applications. As a result, self-driving cars are being compromised perceived as a serious threat. Therefore, analyzing the threats and attacks on self-driving cars and ITSs, and their corresponding countermeasures to reduce those threats and attacks are needed. For this reason, some survey papers compiling potential attacks on VANETs, ITSs and self-driving cars, and their detection mechanisms are available in the current literature. However, up to our knowledge, they have not covered the real attacks already happened in self-driving cars. To bridge this research gap, in this paper, we analyze the attacks that already targeted self-driving cars and extensively present potential cyber-attacks and their impacts on those cars along with their vulnerabilities. For recently reported attacks, we describe the possible mitigation strategies taken by the manufacturers and governments. This survey includes recent works on how a self-driving car can ensure resilient operation even under ongoing cyber-attack. We also provide further research directions to improve the security issues associated with self-driving cars.},

abstract={The advancements in computer systems and networks have created a new environment for criminal acts, widely known as cybercrime. Cybercrime incidents are occurrences of particular criminal offences that pose a serious threat to the global economy, safety, and well-being of society. This paper offers a comprehensive understanding of cybercrime incidents and their corresponding offences combining a series of approaches reported in relevant literature. Initially, this paper reviews and identifies the features of cybercrime incidents, their respective elements and proposes a combinatorial incident description schema. The schema provides the opportunity to systematically combine various elements-or cybercrime characteristics. Additionally, a comprehensive list of cybercrime-related offences is put forward. The offences are ordered in a two-level classification system based on specific criteria to assist in better classification and correlation of their respective incidents. This enables a thorough understanding of the repeating and underlying criminal activities. The proposed system can serve as a common reference overtaking obstacles deriving from misconceptions for cybercrimes with cross-border activities. The proposed schema can be extended with a list of recommended actions, corresponding measures and effective policies that match with the offence type and subsequently with a particular incident. This matching will enable better monitoring, handling and moderate cybercrime incident occurrences. The ultimate objective is to incorporate the schema-based description of cybercrime elements to a complete incident management system with standard operating procedures and protocols.},

abstract={With the widespread use of smartphones, the number of malware has been increasing exponentially. Among smart devices, android devices are the most targeted devices by malware because of their high popularity. This paper proposes a novel framework for android malware detection. Our framework uses various kinds of features to reflect the properties of android applications from various aspects, and the features are refined using our existence-based or similarity-based feature extraction method for effective feature representation on malware detection. Besides, a multimodal deep learning method is proposed to be used as a malware detection model. This paper is the first study of the multimodal deep learning to be used in the android malware detection. With our detection model, it was possible to maximize the benefits of encompassing multiple feature types. To evaluate the performance, we carried out various experiments with a total of 41 260 samples. We compared the accuracy of our model with that of other deep neural network models. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework in various aspects including the efficiency in model updates, the usefulness of diverse features, and our feature representation method. In addition, we compared the performance of our framework with those of other existing methods including deep learning-based methods.},

abstract={Mobile databases are the statutory backbones of many applications on smartphones, and they store a lot of sensitive information. However, vulnerabilities in the operating system or the app logic can lead to sensitive data leakage by giving the adversaries unauthorized access to the app's database. In this paper, we study such vulnerabilities to define a threat model, and we propose an OS-version independent protection mechanism that app developers can utilize to detect such attacks. To do so, we model the user behavior with the database query workload created by the original apps. Here, we model the drift in behavior by comparing probability distributions of the query workload features over time. We then use this model to determine if the app behavior drift is anomalous. We evaluate our framework on real-world workloads of three different popular Android apps, and we show that our system was able to detect more than 90% of such attacks.},

abstract={Deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully-crafted input perturbations could mislead a well-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) to produce incorrect results. Adversarial attacks jeopardize the safety, security, and privacy of DNN-enabled systems. Today's countermeasures to adversarial attacks either do not have the capability to detect adversarial samples at inference-time, or introduce prohibitively high overhead to be practical at inference-time.We propose Ptolemy, an algorithm-architecture co-designed system that detects adversarial attacks at inference time with low overhead and high accuracy. We exploit the synergies between DNN inference and imperative program execution: an input to a DNN uniquely activates a set of neurons that contribute significantly to the inference output, analogous to the sequence of basic blocks exercised by an input in a conventional program. Critically, we observe that adversarial samples tend to activate distinctive paths from those of benign inputs. Leveraging this insight, we propose an adversarial sample detection framework, which uses canary paths generated from offline profiling to detect adversarial samples at runtime. The Ptolemy compiler along with the co-designed hardware enable efficient execution by exploiting the unique algorithmic characteristics. Extensive evaluations show that Ptolemy achieves higher or similar adversarial sample detection accuracy than today's mechanisms with a much lower (as low as 2%) runtime overhead.},

abstract={We seek to create fixed-length features from dorsal finger skin images extracted by the SURF interest point detector to combine it in the privacy enhancing helper data scheme. The source of the biometric samples is the GUC45 database which features finger vein, fingerprint and dorsal finger skin images for modality fusion. First, the region of interest (ROI) is extracted, after which SURF features are extracted, and finally two different approaches for creating fixed length feature vectors are applied. SURF performance on the ROI is comparable to the PolyU database reported in the literature, namely an equal error rate of 0.74%. Of the two explored approaches for fixed-length features creation, averaging the descriptor components proved the most successful, achieving an equal error rate of 11.72%. Potential run-time performance increases were discovered as a side-effect. Without changing the complexity of the SURF matching scheme, a reduction in run-time of 75%-80% has been achieved, with only minimal precision loss; EER increases from 0.74% to 1%. The complexity of the matching can be reduced from O(n2) to constant time, but at a higher precision cost and resulting in an EER of 16.51%.},

abstract={Edge computing allows app vendors to deploy their applications and relevant data on distributed edge servers to serve nearby users. Caching data on edge servers can minimize users' data retrieval latency. However, such cache data are subject to both intentional and accidental corruption in the highly distributed, dynamic, and volatile edge computing environment. Given a large number of edge servers and their limited computing resources, how to effectively and efficiently audit the integrity of app vendors' cache data is a critical and challenging problem. This article makes the first attempt to tackle this Edge Data Integrity (EDI) problem. We first analyze the threat model and the audit objectives, then propose a lightweight sampling-based probabilistic approach, namely EDI-V, to help app vendors audit the integrity of their data cached on a large scale of edge servers. We propose a new data structure named variable Merkle hash tree (VMHT) for generating the integrity proofs of those data replicas during the audit. VMHT can ensure the audit accuracy of EDI-V by maintaining sampling uniformity. EDI-V allows app vendors to inspect their cache data and locate the corrupted ones efficiently and effectively. Both theoretical analysis and comprehensively experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EDI-V.},

abstract={Image classification systems are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are imperceptibly perturbed but lead to spectacularly disgraceful classification. Adversarial training is one of the most effective defenses for improving the robustness of classifiers. We introduce an enhanced adversarial training approach in this work. Motivated by human's consistently accurate perception of surroundings, we explore the artificial attention of deep neural networks in the context of adversarial classification. We begin with an empirical analysis of how the attention of artificial systems will change as the model undergoes adversarial attacks. Observation is that the class-specific attention gets diverted and subsequently induces wrong prediction. To that end, we propose a regularizer encouraging the consistency in the artificial attention on the clean image and its adversarial counterpart. Our method shows improved empirical robustness over the state-of-the-art, secures 55.74% adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10 with perturbation budget of 8/255 under the challenging untargeted attack in white-box settings. Further evaluations on CIFAR-100 also show our potential for a desirable boost in adversarial robustness for deep neural networks.

abstract={The electric power grid, as a critical national infrastructure, is under constant threat from cyber-attacks. State estimation (SE) is at the foundation of a series of critical control processes in a power transmission system. A false data injection (FDI) attack against SE can disrupt these control processes, crippling a power system and wreaking havoc in a region. With knowledge of the system topology, a cyber-attacker can formulate and execute stealthy FDI attacks that are very difficult to detect. Statistical and, more recently, machine learning approaches have been undertaken to detect FDI attacks on SE of the power grid. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) based method to accurately detect stealthy FDI attacks on the SE of power grid. We compare the performance of the DL method with three popular machine learning algorithms, which are: gradient boosting machines (GBM), generalized linear modelings (GLM) and distributed random forests (DRF). All four algorithms analyze a dataset simulating the IEEE 14-bus system. The results demonstrate that these algorithms perform well in accurately and precisely detecting stealthy FDI attacks on the smart grid, with the DL-based approach showing best results.},

abstract={Aimed at improving the resistance against power analysis attacks, a systematic and architectural design approach for multicore processors is proposed in this article and is demonstrated in an eight-core prototype platform with low performance overhead and hardware cost. In order to introduce randomness in both the time dimension and the amplitude dimension and make realignment extremely difficult, the proposed multicore platform leverages several methods together, such as random task scheduling (RTS), random insertion of operations (RIO), and frequency and phase randomization (FPR). Moreover, a power state monitoring and control (PSMC) scheme is proposed to defend against power analysis attacks by keeping enough background noises. A test chip of the proposed multicore processor is fabricated in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 65-nm CMOS LP technology and can operate at up to 800 MHz with a 1.2-V supply. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with these randomization methods is implemented on the processor. Measurement results show that the correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks and the power analysis attacks based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are unsuccessful even with 2 000 000 power traces when all the countermeasures are used.},

abstract={The success of DNNs has driven the extensive applications of person re-identification (ReID) into a new era. However, whether ReID inherits the vulnerability of DNNs remains unexplored. To examine the robustness of ReID systems is rather important because the insecurity of ReID systems may cause severe losses, e.g., the criminals may use the adversarial perturbations to cheat the CCTV systems. In this work, we examine the insecurity of current best-performing ReID models by proposing a learning-to-mis-rank formulation to perturb the ranking of the system output. As the cross-dataset transferability is crucial in the ReID domain, we also perform a back-box attack by developing a novel multi-stage network architecture that pyramids the features of different levels to extract general and transferable features for the adversarial perturbations. Our method can control the number of malicious pixels by using differentiable multi-shot sampling. To guarantee the inconspicuousness of the attack, we also propose a new perception loss to achieve better visual quality. Extensive experiments on four of the largest ReID benchmarks (i.e., Market1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) not only show the effectiveness of our method, but also provides directions of the future improvement in the robustness of ReID systems. For example, the accuracy of one of the best-performing ReID systems drops sharply from 91.8% to 1.4% after being attacked by our method. Some attack results are shown in Fig. 1.

abstract={Security is one of the key challenges in cyberphysical systems, because by their nature, any cyber attack against them can have physical repercussions. This is a critical issue for autonomous vehicles; if compromised in terms of their communications or computation they can cause considerable physical damage due to their mobility. Our aim here is to facilitate the automatic detection of cyber attacks on a robotic vehicle. For this purpose, we have developed a detection mechanism, which monitors real-time data from a large number of sources onboard the vehicle, including its sensors, networks and processing. Following a learning phase, where the vehicle is trained in a non-attack state on what values are considered normal, it is then subjected to a series of different cyber-physical and physical-cyber attacks. We approach the problem as a binary classification problem of whether the robot is able to self-detect when and whether it is under attack. Our experimental results show that the approach is promising for most attacks that the vehicle is subjected to. We further improve its performance by using weights that accentuate the anomalies that are less common thus improving overall performance of the detection mechanism for unknown attacks.},

abstract={To maintain stable and reliable operations in smart grid, accurate state estimation is of paramount importance. However, synthesized false data injection attacks could wisely circumvent conventional bad data detection mechanisms by introducing arbitrary errors to state estimates to seriously affect the entire power system operation. To defend these attacks, phase measurement units (PMUs) are deployed in advance at various locations to reduce the chance of being attacked. However, when the budget of placement is not large enough so that the whole system cannot be covered by PMUs, the existing PMU placement algorithms based on greedy strategies are insufficient in some weak locations due to the nature of greedy strategies. In this article, we propose a new hybrid attack, which can be easily used by attackers to attack the buses with less connectivity and impose adverse impacts to state estimation with a low-attack cost so that existing defenses based on greedy strategies become invalid. We future propose a predeployment PMU greedy algorithm for this new attack in which the most vulnerable buses are first protected and, then, a greedy-based algorithm is used to deploy other PMUs until the whole system is observable. Experimental results on various IEEE standard systems demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes.},

Network attack is no more a single vulnerability exploit, but an APT attack based on multiple complicated methods. Cyberspace attacks have become “rationalized” on the surface. Currently, there are a lot of researches about visualization of attack paths, but there is no an overall plan to reproduce the attack path. Most researches focus on the detection and characterization individual based on single behavior cyberspace attacks, which loose it's abilities to help security personnel understand the complete attack behavior of attackers. The key factors of this paper is to collect the attackers' aggressive behavior by reverse retrospective method based on the actual shooting range environment.

abstract={Remote desktop protocols (RDP) are commonly used for connecting and interacting with computers remotely. In this case, a server component runs on the remote computer and shares its desktop (i.e., screen) with the client component which runs on an end user device. In recent years, a number of vulnerabilities have been identified in two widely used remote desktop implementations, Microsoft Remote Desktop and RealVNC. These vulnerabilities may expose the remote server to a new attack vector. This concern is increased when it comes to a cyber-physical system (CPS) in which a client device with a low trust level connects to the critical system via the remote desktop server. In order to mitigate this risk, in this paper we propose a network based intrusion detection system (NIDS) specifically designed for securing the remote desktop connections. The propose method utilizes an innovative anomaly detection technique based on machine learning for detecting malicious TCP packets, which can carry exploits aimed at the RDP server. An empirical evaluation conducted on an avionic system setup consisting of a commercial tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab) connected through a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) remote desktop implementation to a real electronic flight bag (EFB) server shows that the proposed method can detect malicious packets carrying real exploits (reported in recent years) with a true positive rate of 0.863 and a false positive rate of 0.0001.},

abstract={Still-to-video face recognition (FR) is an important function in many video surveillance applications, allowing to recognize target individuals of interest appearing over a distributed network of cameras. Systems for still-to-video FR match faces captured in videos under challenging conditions against facial models, often based on a single reference still per individual. To improve robustness to intra-class variations, an adaptive visual tracker is considered for learning of a diversified face trajectory model for each person appearing in the scene. These appearance models are updated along a trajectory, and matched against the reference gallery stills of each individual enrolled to the system. Matching scores per individual are thereby accumulated over successive frames for robust spatio-temporal recognition. In a specific implementation, face trajectory models learned with a STRUCK tracker are compared to reference stills using an ensemble of SVMs per individual that are trained a priori to discriminate target reference faces (in gallery stills) versus non-target faces (in videos from the operational domain). To represent common pose and illumination variations, domain-specific face synthesis is employed to augment the number of reference stills. Experimental results obtained with this implementation on the Chokepoint video dataset indicate that the proposed system can maintain a comparably high level of accuracy versus state-of-the-art systems, yet requires a lower complexity.},

abstract={The digitalization of power systems over the past decade has made the cybersecurity of substations a top priority for regulatory agencies and utilities. Proprietary communication protocols are being increasingly replaced by standardized and interoperable protocols providing utility operators with remote access and control capabilities at the expense of growing cyberattack risks. In particular, the potential of supply chain cyberattacks is on the rise in industrial control systems. In this environment, there is a pressing need for the development of cyberattack detection systems for substations and in particular protective relays, a critical component of substation operation. This article presents a deep learning-based cyberattack detection system for transmission line protective relays. The proposed cyberattack detection system is first trained with current and voltage measurements representing various types of faults on the transmission lines. The cyberattack detection system is then employed to detect current and voltage measurements that are maliciously injected by an attacker to trigger the transmission line protective relays. The proposed cyberattack detection system is evaluated under a variety of cyberattack scenarios. The results demonstrate that a universal architecture can be designed for the deep learning-based cyberattack detection systems in substations.},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are an important component to effectively protect computer systems. Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls. Results show our system to be very competitive to existing signature sets.},

Consequently, the accuracy of artifacts found also relies on the performance of techniques used, especially DL models. Recently, Deep Neural Nets (DNN) have achieved state of the art performance in the tasks of classification and recognition. In the context of digital forensics, DNN has been applied in the domains of cybercrime investigation such as child abuse investigations, malware classification, steganalysis and image forensics. However, the robustness of DNN models in the context of digital forensics is never studied before. Hence, in this research, we design and implement a domain-independent Adversary Testing Framework (ATF) to test security robustness of black-box DNN's. By using ATF, we also methodically test a commercially available DNN service used in forensic investigations and bypass the detection, where published methods fail in control settings.},

abstract={The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems and smart digital devices, has perceived them targeted by network attacks. Botnets are vectors buttoned up which the attackers grapple the control of IoT systems and comportment venomous activities. To confront this challenge, efficient machine learning and deep learning with suitable feature engineering are suggested to detect and protect the network from such vulnerabilities in the future. For the efficient detection of cyber attacks, the representative dataset shall be well-structured for training the model and then validating the proposed system to develop an optimal security model. In this research, we used the UNSW-NB15, a new IoT-Botnet dataset (a noisy and imbalanced dataset) to classify cyber-attacks. K-Medoid sampling and scatter search-based feature engineering techniques are used to obtain a representative dataset with optimal feature subsets. To validate the proposed methodologies, three most recent machine learning (ML) methods including (i) JChaid*- a recent upgrade version to Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) decision tree-based, (ii) A2DE (a semi-naive Bayesian averaged two-dependence estimator), & (iii) HGC- a hybrid of Genetic algorithm with K-means clustering and two deep learning (DL) methods such as (i) Deep Multilayer perceptron (DMLP) & (ii) Convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifiers are employed. From the extensive experimental analysis, it is pronounced that scatter search-based DMLP classifier outperforms the other competing models in terms of (i) highest detection rate with100% accuracy, 100% macro-averaged precision, 100% macro-averaged recall & 100% macro-averaged F1-score and (ii) low computational complexity with the least training time of 4.7 seconds & testing time of 0.61 seconds.},

abstract={Over the last five years there has been an increase in the frequency and diversity of network attacks. This holds true, as more and more organizations admit compromises on a daily basis. Many misuse and anomaly based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that rely on either signatures, supervised or statistical methods have been proposed in the literature, but their trustworthiness is debatable. Moreover, as this paper uncovers, the current IDSs are based on obsolete attack classes that do not reflect the current attack trends. For these reasons, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of unsupervised and hybrid methods for intrusion detection, discussing their potential in the domain. We also present and highlight the importance of feature engineering techniques that have been proposed for intrusion detection. Furthermore, we discuss that current IDSs should evolve from simple detection to correlation and attribution. We descant how IDS data could be used to reconstruct and correlate attacks to identify attackers, with the use of advanced data analytics techniques. Finally, we argue how the present IDS attack classes can be extended to match the modern attacks and propose three new classes regarding the outgoing network communication.},

abstract={High-assurance embedded systems are deployed for decades and expensive to re-certify - hence, each new attack is an unpatchable problem that can only be detected by monitoring out-of-band channels such as the system's power trace or electromagnetic emissions. Micro-Architectural attacks, for example, have recently come to prominence since they break all existing software-isolation based security - for example, by hammering memory rows to gain root privileges or by abusing speculative execution and shared hardware to leak secret data. This work is the first to use anomalies in an embedded system's power trace to detect evasive micro-architectural attacks. To this end, we introduce power-mimicking micro-architectural attacks - including DRAM-rowhammer attacks, side/covert-channel and speculation-driven attacks - to study their evasiveness. We then quantify the operating range of the power-anomalies detector using the Odroid XU3 board - showing that rowhammer attacks cannot evade detection while covert channel and speculation-driven attacks can evade detection but are forced to operate at a 36× and 7× lower bandwidth. Our power-anomaly detector is efficient and can be embedded-of-band into (e.g.,) programmable batteries. While rowhammer, side-channel, and speculation-driven attack defenses require invasive code- and hardware-changes in general-purpose systems, we show that power-anomalies are a simple and effective defense for embedded systems. Power-anomalies can help future-proof embedded systems against vulnerabilities that are likely to emerge as new hardware like phase-change memories and accelerators become mainstream.},

We re-visit the algorithm and show that the algorithm tolerates some serious security flaws. Ignoring specific areas of the image in the feature extraction stage and invariance against individual ring rotation are two existing drawbacks. Practical experiments show the mentioned weaknesses and some solutions will be proposed.},

abstract={Physical layer key generation is an important handshaking step for establishing secure wireless communication in wireless networks. Existing methods based on fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) have seen significant limitations. Reciprocity, the theoretical basis of physical layer key generation, is sensitive to factors such as noise, interference and hardware level variations. Feedback-based Channel Gain Complement is designed to conquer the imperfect reciprocity between two communication parties in actual environments. In addition, we have found that the adjacent subcarriers are strongly correlated. Quantizing all 30 subcarriers without discrimination will reduce the randomness and strength of the secret key while discarding some carriers will lose important information. We propose a cluster-based quantization method, which balances between the generation speed and consistency in initial key bits. Evaluation results in static and mobile scenarios have shown that under the sampling rate of 5 packet/sec, Bit Generation Rate can reach 20~ 26 bps, and the generated key sequence can pass the NIST standard randomness test.},

pages={122-131},
abstract={GPUs are increasingly being used in security applications, especially for accelerating encryption/decryption. While GPUs are an attractive platform in terms of performance, the security of these devices raises a number of concerns. One vulnerability is the data-dependent timing information, which can be exploited by adversary to recover the encryption key. Memory system features are frequently exploited since they create detectable timing variations. In this paper, our attack model is a coalescing attack, which leverages a critical GPU microarchitectural feature the coalescing unit. As multiple concurrent GPU memory requests can refer to the same cache block, the coalescing unit collapses them into a single memory transaction. The access time of an encryption kernel is dependent on the number of transactions. Correlation between a guessed key value and the associated timing samples can be exploited to recover the secret key. In this paper, a series of hardware/software countermeasures are proposed to obfuscate the memory timing side channel, making the GPU more resilient without impacting performance. Our hardware-based approach attempts to randomize the width of the coalescing unit to lower the signal-to-noise ratio. We present a hierarchical Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR) design that can merge transactions across different warps. This feature boosts performance, while, at the same time, secures the execution. We also present a software-based approach to permute the organization of critical data structures, significantly changing the coalescing behavior and introducing a high degree of randomness. Equipped with our new protections, the effort to launch a successful attack is increased up to $1433X\times 178X$, while also improving encryption/decryption performance up to 7%.},

abstract={Sophisticated cyber attacks by state-sponsored and criminal actors continue to plague government and industrial infrastructure. Intuitively, partitioning cyber systems into survivable, intrusion tolerant compartments is a good idea. This prevents witting and unwitting insiders from moving laterally and reaching back to their command and control (C2) servers. However, there is a lack of artifacts that can predict the effectiveness of this approach in a realistic setting. We extend earlier work by relaxing simplifying assumptions and providing a new attacker-facing metric. In this article, we propose new closed-form mathematical models and a discrete time simulation to predict three critical statistics: probability of compromise, probability of external host compromise and probability of reachback. The results of our new artifacts agree with one another and with previous work, which suggests they are internally valid and a viable method to evaluate the effectiveness of cyber zone defense.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a vital role in the development of smart cities. They enable various road safety and efficiency applications such as optimized traffic management, collision avoidance, and pollution control through the collection and evaluation of traffic data from Road Side Units (RSUs) and connected vehicles in real time. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to data corruption attacks which can seriously influence their decision-making abilities. Traditional attack detection schemes do not account for attackers' sophisticated and evolving strategies and ignore the ITS's constraints on security resources. In this paper, we devise a security game model that allows the defense mechanism deployed in the ITS to optimize the distribution of available resources for attack detection while considering mixed attack strategies, according to which the attacker targets multiple RSUs in a distributed fashion. In our security game, the utility of the ITS is quantified in terms of detection rate, attack damage, and the relevance of the information transmitted by the RSUs. The proposed approach will enable the ITS to mitigate the impact of attacks and increase its resiliency. The results show that our approach reduces the attack impact by at least 20% compared to the one that fairly allocates security resources to RSUs indifferently to attackers' strategies.},

State-of-the-art mobile communication systems do not fulfill the end-to-end delay and overall reliability requirements of URLLCs. In particular, a holistic framework that takes into account latency, reliability, availability, scalability, and decision-making under uncertainty is lacking. Driven by recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks, deep learning algorithms have been considered as promising ways of developing enabling technologies for URLLCs in future 6G networks. This tutorial illustrates how domain knowledge (models, analytical tools, and optimization frameworks) of communications and networking can be integrated into different kinds of deep learning algorithms for URLLCs. We first provide some background of URLLCs and review promising network architectures and deep learning frameworks for 6G. To better illustrate how to improve learning algorithms with domain knowledge, we revisit model-based analytical tools and cross-layer optimization frameworks for URLLCs. Following this, we examine the potential of applying supervised/unsupervised deep learning and deep reinforcement learning in URLLCs and summarize related open problems. Finally, we provide simulation and experimental results to validate the effectiveness of different learning algorithms and discuss future directions.},

abstract={The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has allowed for unprecedented data collection, automation, and remote sensing and actuation, transforming autonomous systems and bringing smart command and control into numerous cyber physical systems (CPS) that our daily lives depend on. Simultaneously, dramatic improvements in machine learning and deep neural network architectures have enabled unprecedented analytical capabilities, which we see in increasingly common applications and production technologies, such as self-driving vehicles and intelligent mobile applications. Predictably, these technologies have seen rapid adoption, which has left many implementations vulnerable to threats unforeseen or undefended against. Moreover, such technologies can be used by malicious actors, and the potential for cyber threats, attacks, intrusions, and obfuscation that are only just being considered, applied, and countered. In this paper, we consider the good, the bad, and the ugly use of machine learning for cybersecurity and CPS/IoT. In detail, we consider the numerous benefits (good use) that machine learning has brought, both in general, and specifically for security and CPS/IoT, such as the improvement of intrusion detection mechanisms and decision accuracy in CPS/IoT. More pressing, we consider the vulnerabilities of machine learning (bad use) from the perspectives of security and CPS/IoT, including the ways in which machine learning systems can be compromised, misled, and subverted at all stages of the machine learning life-cycle (data collection, pre-processing, training, validation, implementation, etc.). Finally, the most concerning, a growing trend has been the utilization of machine learning in the execution of cyberattacks and intrusions (ugly use). Thus, we consider existing mechanisms with the potential to improve target acquisition and existing threat patterns, as well as those that can enable novel attacks yet to be seen.},

abstract={Battery systems are crucial components for mission-critical data centers. Without secure energy backup, existing under-provisioned data centers are largely unguarded targets for cyber criminals. Particularly for today's scale-out servers, power oversubscription unavoidably taxes a data center's backup energy resources, leaving very little room for dealing with emergency. Besides, the emerging trend towards deploying distributed energy storage architecture causes the associated energy backup of each rack to shrink, making servers vulnerable to power anomalies. As a result, an attacker can generate power peaks to easily crash or disrupt a power-constrained system. This study aims at securing data centers from malicious loads that seek to drain their precious energy storage and overload server racks without prior detection. We term such load as Power Virus (PV) and demonstrate its basic two-phase attacking model and characterize its behaviors on real systems. The PV can learn the victim rack's battery characteristics by disguising as benign loads. Once gaining enough information, the PV can be mutated to generate hidden power spikes that have a high chance to overload the system. To defend against PV, we propose power attack defense (PAD), a novel energy management patch built on lightweight software and hardware mechanisms. PAD not only increases the attacking cost considerably by hiding vulnerable racks from visible spikes, it also strengthens the last line of defense against hidden spikes. Using Google cluster traces we show that PAD can effectively raise the bar of a successful power attack: compared to prior arts, it increases the data center survival time by 1.6~11X and provides better performance guarantee. It enables modern data centers to safely exploit the benefits that power oversubscription may provide, with the slightest cost overhead.},

abstract={In distributed environments, where unknown entities cooperate to achieve complex goals, intelligent techniques for estimating agents' truthfulness are required. Distributed Reputation Management Systems (RMSs) allow to accomplish this task without the need for a central entity that may represent a bottleneck and a single point of failure. The design of a distributed RMS is a challenging task due to a multitude of factors that could impact on its performances. In order to support the researcher in evaluating the RMS robustness against security attacks since its beginning design phase, in this work we present a distributed simulation environment that allows to model both the agent's behaviors and the logic of the RMS itself. Moreover, in order to compare at simulation time the performance of the designed distributed RMS with a baseline obtained by an ideal RMS, we introduce an omniscient process called truth-holder which owns a global knowledge all involved entities. The effectiveness of our platform was proved by a set of experiments aimed at measuring the vulnerability of a RMS to a common set of security attacks.},

abstract={Botnets are one of predominant threats to Internet security. To date, machine learning technology has wide application in botnet detection because that it is able to summarize the features of existing attacks and generalize to never-before-seen botnet families. However, recent works in adversarial machine learning have shown that attackers are able to bypass the detection model by constructing specific samples, which due to many algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. According to the degree of adversaries' knowledge about the model, adversarial attacks can be classified into several groups, such as gradient- and score-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a more general framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which effectively generates adversarial traffic flows to deceive the detection model by automatically adding perturbations to samples. Throughout the process, the target detector will be regarded as a black box and more close to realistic attack circumstance. A reinforcement learning agent is equipped for updating the adversarial samples by combining the feedback from the target model (i.e. benign or malicious) and the sequence of actions, which is able to change the temporal and spatial features of the traffic flows while maintaining the original functionality and executability. The experiment results show that the evasion rates of adversarial botnet flows are significantly improved. Furthermore, with the perspective of defense, this research can help the detection model spot its defect and thus enhance the robustness.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by their ability to integrate the physical and information or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area.},

abstract={Vehicle automation has been one of the fundamental applications within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) since the start of ITS research in the mid-1980s. For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.},

abstract={To improve the resilience of state estimation strategy against cyber attacks, the Compressive Sensing (CS) is applied in reconstruction of incomplete measurements for cyber physical systems. First, observability analysis is used to decide the time to run the reconstruction and the damage level from attacks. In particular, the dictionary learning is proposed to form the over-completed dictionary by K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD). Besides, due to the irregularity of incomplete measurements, sampling matrix is designed as the measurement matrix. Finally, the simulation experiments on 6-bus power system illustrate that the proposed method achieves the incomplete measurements reconstruction perfectly, which is better than the joint dictionary. When only 29% available measurements are left, the proposed method has generality for four kinds of recovery algorithms.},

abstract={The interconnected and heterogeneous nature of the next-generation Electrical Grid (EG), widely known as Smart Grid (SG), bring severe cybersecurity and privacy risks that can also raise domino effects against other Critical Infrastructures (CIs). In this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) specially designed for the SG environments that use Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) protocols. The proposed IDS called MENSA (anoMaly dEtection aNd claSsificAtion) adopts a novel Autoencoder-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for (a) detecting operational anomalies and (b) classifying Modbus/TCP and DNP3 cyberattacks. In particular, MENSA combines the aforementioned Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a common architecture, taking into account the adversarial loss and the reconstruction difference. The proposed IDS is validated in four real SG evaluation environments, namely (a) SG lab, (b) substation, (c) hydropower plant and (d) power plant, solving successfully an outlier detection (i.e., anomaly detection) problem as well as a challenging multiclass classification problem consisting of 14 classes (13 Modbus/TCP cyberattacks and normal instances). Furthermore, MENSA can discriminate five cyberattacks against DNP3. The evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of MENSA compared to other Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods in terms of Accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), True Positive Rate (TPR) and the F1 score.},

abstract={During robot-assisted therapy of hemiplegic patients, interaction with the patient must be intrinsically safe. Straight-forward collision avoidance solutions can provide this safety requirement with conservative margins. These margins heavily reduce the robot's workspace and make interaction with the patient's unguided body parts impossible. However, interaction with the own body is highly beneficial from a therapeutic point of view. We tackle this problem by combining haptic rendering techniques with classical computer vision methods. Our proposed solution consists of a pipeline that builds collision objects from point clouds in real-time and a controller that renders haptic interaction. The raw sensor data is processed to overcome noise and occlusion problems. Our proposed approach is validated on the 6 DoF exoskeleton ANYexo for direct impacts, sliding scenarios, and dynamic collision surfaces. The results show that this method has the potential to successfully prevent collisions and allow haptic interaction for highly dynamic environments. We believe that this work significantly adds to the usability of current exoskeletons by enabling virtual haptic interaction with the patient's body parts in human-robot therapy.},

abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide state-of-the-art results for most machine learning and computer vision tasks. However, they have been found susceptible to adversarial examples. In the recent literature, many ways of generating adversarial examples have been discovered. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Compared to traditional optimisation-based methods, our method provides a fast yet powerful alternative for adversary generation. Unlike other GAN-based approaches in the literature which learn to generate an intermediate perturbation vector, our method generates adversarial examples from benign input images in a straightforward manner. By directly generating adversarial examples from given input images, our method produces perturbations that better align with the underlying edge and shape contained in the inputs, hence more natural-looking and imperceptible to human eyes. We evaluate our method on the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN-based attack AdvGAN with similar attack capability in terms of distortion. We show that our method produces competitive results to notable optimisation-based attacks in the literature including the strongest Carlini & Wagner (CW) attack.},

abstract={Attackers increasingly use passwords leaked from one website to compromise associated accounts on other websites. Such targeted attacks work because users reuse, or pick similar, passwords for different websites. We recast one of the core technical challenges underlying targeted attacks as the task of modeling similarity of human-chosen passwords. We show how to learn good password similarity models using a compilation of 1.4 billion leaked email, password pairs. Using our trained models of password similarity, we exhibit the most damaging targeted attack to date. Simulations indicate that our attack compromises more than 16% of user accounts in less than a thousand guesses, should one of their other passwords be known to the attacker and despite the use of state-of-the art countermeasures. We show via a case study involving a large university authentication service that the attacks are also effective in practice. We go on to propose the first-ever defense against such targeted attacks, by way of personalized password strength meters (PPSMs). These are password strength meters that can warn users when they are picking passwords that are vulnerable to attacks, including targeted ones that take advantage of the user's previously compromised passwords. We design and build a PPSM that can be compressed to less than 3 MB, making it easy to deploy in order to accurately estimate the strength of a password against all known guessing attacks.},

abstract={Recent advancements in network technology and associated services have led to a rapid increase in the amount of data traffic. However, the detrimental effects caused by cyber-attacks have also significantly increased. Network attacks are evolving in various forms. Two primary approaches exist for addressing such threats: signature-based detection and anomaly detection. Although the aforementioned approaches can be effective, they also have certain drawbacks. Signature-based detection is vulnerable to variant attacks, while anomaly detection cannot be used for real-time data traffic. For resolving such issues, this paper proposes a two-level classifier that can simultaneously achieve high performance and real-time classification. It employs level 1 and 2 classifiers internally. The level 1 classifier initially performs real-time detection with moderate accuracy for incoming data traffic. If the data cannot be classified with high probability by the classifier, the classification is delayed until the traffic flow terminates. The level 2 classifier then collects the statistical features of the traffic flow for performing precise classification. Compared to existing techniques, the proposed two-level classification method can achieve superior performance in terms of accuracy and detection time.},

abstract={In an end-to-end vehicle control scenario, where a deep neural network is trained on visual input solely, adversarial vulnerability leaves a possibility to manipulate the steering predictions. Patch-based adversarial attacks present an especially serious menace, because they can be performed in the real world by printing out a generated universal pattern. However, the boundary conditions and feasibility of such attacks to compromise the security of autonomous vehicles have been only sparsely studied so far.We demonstrate and evaluate such attacks in the CARLA simulative environment under different weather and lighting settings, while conducting experiments in open and closed loop attack scenarios. Our findings reveal that attack strength is highly dependent on the surrounding location as well as on environment conditions. We also observe that attack success in an open loop scenario only partially coincides with that in a closed loop scenario. This analysis helps to set the stage for future experiments on public roads.Furthermore, we propose a defense concept to remove malignant perturbations from an input image, which does not affect its salient regions. We analyze deviations from the unattacked vehicle trajectory both on adversarial and suppressed inputs.},

By impersonating legitimate users, the intruders can use a service's abundant resources maliciously. To combat attackers, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) can offer additional security measures for these environments by investigating configurations, logs, network traffic, and user actions to identify typical attack behavior. However, IDS must be distributed to work in a grid computing environment. It must monitor each node and, when an attack occurs, alert other nodes in the environment. This kind of communication requires compatibility between heterogeneous hosts, various communication mechanisms, and permission control over system maintenance and updates. We present the problem of grid intrusion; analyze the requirements of a system to detect them. In this paper we are discussing how IDS can be implemented for grid computing environment.},

abstract={A fully automated 2-D+time myocardial segmentation framework is proposed for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data sets. Ischemia detection with CINE BOLD CMR relies on spatio-temporal patterns in myocardial intensity, but these patterns also trouble supervised segmentation methods, the de facto standard for myocardial segmentation in cine MRI. Segmentation errors severely undermine the accurate extraction of these patterns. In this paper, we build a joint motion and appearance method that relies on dictionary learning to find a suitable subspace. Our method is based on variational pre-processing and spatial regularization using Markov random fields, to further improve performance. The superiority of the proposed segmentation technique is demonstrated on a data set containing cardiac phase-resolved BOLD MR and standard CINE MR image sequences acquired in baseline and ischemic condition across ten canine subjects. Our unsupervised approach outperforms even supervised state-of-the-art segmentation techniques by at least 10% when using Dice to measure accuracy on BOLD data and performs at par for standard CINE MR. Furthermore, a novel segmental analysis method attuned for BOLD time series is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving key BOLD patterns.},

abstract={A secured “co-operative cloud computing utility”, is a shared set of unique and virtually interconnected system assets. These, computing services, are accessed globally using thin clients and handheld devices through standard collective GUI, anytime, at any location upon payment of specified usage charges. This multi-ally computing utility perks up the advanced facilities to the existing assets. The security and privacy controlling of this utility (data centers, and data storage) is uniformly, vested with service patrons and suppliers, both stakeholders with shared responsibility of security implementation using multilateral relationship among them. In this paper, we propose the ontology of this vicinity, which demonstrates an interrelated layered architecture for a secured co-operative galactic computing utility. This computing architecture is proposed empirically based on our understanding and survey with various industry/academic professionals. We tried to understand the challenges they faced while using the cloud system. So, we conceptually propose this ally architecture which consists of multi-layer with multi-lateral co-operative multi-factor balanced security framework with common business interests along with shared responsibility among the stakeholders. Also we try to prove empirically multilateral balanced security which in-turn increases the strong defense measures among the multi-laterally allied bunch of users.},

abstract={Threats that have been primarily targeting nation states and their associated entities have expanded the target zone to include the private and corporate sectors. This class of threats, well known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), are those that every nation and well-established organization fears and wants to protect itself against. While nation-sponsored APT attacks will always be marked by their sophistication, APT attacks that have become prominent in corporate sectors do not make it any less challenging for the organizations. The rate at which the attack tools and techniques are evolving is making any existing security measures inadequate. As defenders strive to secure every endpoint and every link within their networks, attackers are finding new ways to penetrate into their target systems. With each day bringing new forms of malware, having new signatures and behavior that is close to normal, a single threat detection system would not suffice. While it requires time and patience to perform APT, solutions that adapt to the changing behavior of APT attacker(s) are required. Several works have been published on detecting an APT attack at one or two of its stages, but very limited research exists in detecting APT as a whole from reconnaissance to cleanup, as such a solution demands complex correlation and fine-grained behavior analysis of users and systems within and across networks. Through this survey paper, we intend to bring all those methods and techniques that could be used to detect different stages of APT attacks, learning methods that need to be applied and where to make your threat detection framework smart and undecipherable for those adapting APT attackers. We also present different case studies of APT attacks, different monitoring methods, and mitigation methods to be employed for fine-grained control of security of a networked system. We conclude this paper with different challenges in defending against APT and opportunities for further research, ending with a note on what we learned during our writing of this paper.},

Motivated by these factors, we extensively survey the existing research outputs and achievements of the privacy field in both application and theoretical angles, aiming to pave a solid starting ground for interested readers to address the challenges in the big data case. We first present an overview of the battle ground by defining the roles and operations of privacy systems. Second, we review the milestones of the current two major research categories of privacy: data clustering and privacy frameworks. Third, we discuss the effort of privacy study from the perspectives of different disciplines, respectively. Fourth, the mathematical description, measurement, and modeling on privacy are presented. We summarize the challenges and opportunities of this promising topic at the end of this paper, hoping to shed light on the exciting and almost uncharted land.},

pages={794-801},
abstract={Lightweight virtualization represented by container technology provides a virtual environment for cloud services with more flexibility and efficiency due to the kernel-sharing property. However, the shared kernel also means that the system isolation mechanisms are incomplete. Attackers can scan the shared system configuration files to explore vulnerabilities for launching attacks. Previous works mainly eliminate the problem by fixing operating systems or using access control policies, but these methods require significant modifications and cannot meet the security needs of individual containers accurately. In this paper, we present ConfigRand, a moving target defense framework to prevent the information leakages due to the shared kernel in the container-based cloud. The ConfigRand deploys deceptive system configurations for each container, bounding the scan of attackers aimed at the shared kernel. In design of ConfigRand, we (1) propose a framework applying the moving target defense philosophy to periodically generate, distribute, and deploy the deceptive system configurations in the container-based cloud; (2) establish a model to formalize these configurations and quantify their heterogeneity; (3) present a configuration movement strategy to evaluate and optimize the variation of configurations. The results show that ConfigRand can effectively prevent the information leakages due to the shared kernel and apply to typical container applications with minimal system modification and performance degradation.},

abstract={Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall; accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate may change significantly when considering various attack types and different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical infrastructures.},

It has been shown that such attacks can cause significant damage even in the presence of control-flow defense mechanisms. However, these threats have not been adequately addressed. In this systematization of knowledge (SoK) paper, we first map data-oriented exploits, including Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) and Block-Oriented Programming attacks, to their assumptions/requirements and attack capabilities. We also compare known defenses against these attacks, in terms of approach, detection capabilities, overhead, and compatibility. Then we discuss the possible frequency anomalies of data-oriented attacks, especially the frequency anomalies of DOP attacks with experimental proofs. It is generally believed that control flows may not be useful for data-oriented security. How-ever, the frequency anomalies show that data-oriented attacks (especially DOP attacks) may generate side-effects on control-flow behavior in multiple dimensions. In the end, we discuss challenges for building deployable data-oriented defenses and open research questions.},

abstract={Recently, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications is experiencing tremendous growth in terms of number of users. Most of the applications use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a signaling protocol to establish and terminate call sessions. To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized. Performance evaluation results from the experimental test bed shows that the fine grained model detects signaling attacks with high classification accuracy.},

abstract={Cyber-security issues on adversarial attacks are actively studied in the field of computer vision with the camera as the main sensor source to obtain the input image or video data. However, in modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs), many other types of sensors are becoming popularly used, such as surveillance sensors, microphones, and textual interfaces. A series of recent works investigates the adversarial attacks and the potential defenses in these noncamera sensor-based CPSs. Therefore, this article provides a systematic discussion on these existing works and serves as a complimentary summary of the adversarial attacks and defenses for CPSs beyond the field of computer vision. We first introduce a general working flow for adversarial attacks on CPSs. On this basis, a clear taxonomy is provided to organize existing attacks effectively and indicate where the defenses can be potentially performed in CPSs as well. Then, we discuss these existing attacks and defenses with detailed comparison studies. Finally, we point out concrete research opportunities to be further explored along this research direction.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT), various devices operate collaboratively in collecting data, relaying information to one another, and processing information intelligently. Due to interactions and dependencies between the IoT devices, the malfunction of one device may trigger a cascade of unexpected and often undesired state changes of other devices, introducing or accelerating catastrophic cascading failures. Understanding the causes of cascading failures and modeling their behavior and effects is crucial for guaranteeing the reliability of IoT systems and delivering the desired quality of service. This article systematically reviews cascading failures modeling and reliability analysis methodologies, as well as mitigation strategies for building the resilience of IoT systems against cascading failures. The review covers diverse IoT applications, from smart grids to smart homes, from sensor networks to IoT cloud computing, and from transportation networks to interdependent infrastructure networks. Opportunities and open research issues are also discussed in relation to restrictions of the current cascading failure models and methods, and potential new technologies and complexity of the constantly evolving IoT systems.},

abstract={With rapid information development, data sharing becomes a crucial part in the Internet. In the process of sharing, data ownership protection and data traceability are two key issues that need to be solved urgently. To address these problem, digital watermarking technology can be a solution. Digital watermarking is used to guard the rights of owners of digital products. Many robust and reversible watermarking techniques are proposed recently to ensure the rights and recover original data set. But most methods require primary keys of the data as a required parameter, resulting in original data not recovered and partial data not traceable against data structure attack. In this paper, a cluster-based robust and reversible watermarking (RRWC) technique for relational data has been proposed that provides a solution to two major function: ownership rights protection and partial data traceability. The unsupervised classification algorithm is used to group dataset, where the primary key of the data will not be used and the watermarks can be embedded with low distortion and high capacity. RRWC addresses malicious attacks, such as subset insertion attack, deletion attack, alteration attack and data structure attack. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of RRWC against attacks.},

abstract={Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most severe threats to the current network security. As a new network architecture, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) draws notable attention from both industry and academia. The characteristics of SDN such as centralized management and flow-based traffic monitoring make it an ideal platform to defend against DDoS attacks. When designing a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) in SDN, how to obtain fine-grained flow information with minimal overhead to the SDN architecture is a problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose TPDD, a two-phase DDoS detection system to detect DDoS attacks in SDN. In the first phase, we utilize the characteristics of SDN to collect coarse-grained flow information from the core switches and locate the potential victim. Then we monitor the edge switches located close to the potential victim to obtain finer-grained traffic information in the second phase. The collection method of each phase fully considers the impact on the bandwidth between the controller and switches. Without modifying the existing flow rules, the collection module can obtain sufficient information about traffic. By using entropy-based and machine learning-based methods, the detection module can effectively detect anomalies and identify whether the potential victim marked in the first phase is the target of attacks. Experimental results show that TPDD can effectively detect DDoS attacks with little overhead.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) defines a new data-driven programming paradigm that constructs the internal system logic of a crafted neuron network through a set of training data. We have seen wide adoption of DL in many safety-critical scenarios. However, a plethora of studies have shown that the state-of-the-art DL systems suffer from various vulnerabilities which can lead to severe consequences when applied to real-world applications. Currently, the testing adequacy of a DL system is usually measured by the accuracy of test data. Considering the limitation of accessible high quality test data, good accuracy performance on test data can hardly provide confidence to the testing adequacy and generality of DL systems. Unlike traditional software systems that have clear and controllable logic and functionality, the lack of interpretability in a DL system makes system analysis and defect detection difficult, which could potentially hinder its real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose DeepGauge, a set of multi-granularity testing criteria for DL systems, which aims at rendering a multi-faceted portrayal of the testbed. The in-depth evaluation of our proposed testing criteria is demonstrated on two well-known datasets, five DL systems, and with four state-of-the-art adversarial attack techniques against DL. The potential usefulness of DeepGauge sheds light on the construction of more generic and robust DL systems.},

In this paper, in order to increase the accuracy of vulnerability exploitation probability estimation in the risk assessment phase, in addition to inherent characteristics of vulnerabilities, their temporal characteristics are also considered. In the risk mitigation phase, Bayesian decision networks are used to model interconnections between vulnerabilities that enable the attacker to achieve a particular goal, the security countermeasures covering these vulnerabilities, their cost of implementation and resulted outcome. Using Bayesian decision networks, our approach yields scalability and integration of risk assessment and mitigation processes. A cost-benefit analysis is done to identify the minimum-cost hardening security measures in situations where the allocated budget for network security hardening is limited.

abstract={Deep Neural Network (DNN) has witnessed rapid progress and significant successes in the recent years. Wide range of applications depends on the high performance of deep learning to solve real-life challenges. Deep learning is being applied in many safety-critical environments. However, deep neural networks have been recently found vulnerable to adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. Stealthy adversarial examples and backdoor attacks can easily fool deep neural networks to generate the wrong results. The risk of adversarial examples attacks that target deep learning models impedes the wide deployment of deep neural networks in safety-critical environments. In this work we propose a defensive technique for deep learning by combining activation function and neurons pruning to reduce the effects of adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. We evaluate the efficacy of the method on an anomaly detection application using Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (CoGAN). The method reduces the loss of accuracy from the attacks from an average 10% to 2% using DBN and from an average 14% to 2% using CoGAN. We evaluate the method using two benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD and ransomware.},

abstract={Determining entropy rates of stochastic processes is a fundamental but difficult problem, with closed-form solutions known only for specific cases. This paper pushes the state-of-the-art by solving the problem for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Renyi entropies. While computation of Renyi entropy for Markov chains reduces to studying the growth of a simple matrix product, computations for HMMs involve products of random matrices. As a result, this case is much harder and no explicit formulas have been known so far. In the finite-sample regime we circumvent this issue for Renyi entropy of integer orders, reducing the problem again to single matrix products where the matrix is built from transition and emission probabilities by means of tensor products. To obtain results in the asymptotic setting, we use a novel technique for determining the growth of non-negative matrix powers. The classical approach - Frobenius-Perron theory - requires positivity assumptions; we instead work directly with the spectral formula. As a consequence, our results do not suffer from limitations such as irreducibility and aperiodicity. This improves our understanding of the entropy rate even for standard (unhidden) chains. A recently published side-channel attack against RSA was proven effective using our result.},

abstract={The next generation of mobile communication system will allow a plethora of new services and use cases. By offering support for high throughput connections, low latency response and massive number of connections, the fifth generation of the mobile network will trigger applications unseen in any other network. However, one important application scenario is not being properly addressed by the players responsible for the mobile networks' standardization, that is the remote and rural areas network. This scenario requires large cells with high throughput, flexibility to opportunistically exploit free bands below 1 GHz and spectrum agility to change the operational frequency when an incumbent is detected. Incipient actions are being considered for the Release 17 but based on the new radio specification as starting point. The limitations imposed by orthogonal waveforms in the physical layers hinder the exploitation of vacant TV channels in rural and remote areas. 5G-RANGE, a Brazil-Europe bilateral cooperation project, aims at conceiving, implementing and deploying an innovative mobile network, designed to provide reliable and cost-effective connection in these regions. This network can be seamlessly integrated with the other 5G scenarios, closing the connectivity gap between the urban, rural and remote areas. Hence, 5G-RANGE network is an interesting complementary solution for beyond 5G standards. This paper presents the major achievements of the 5G-RANGE project, from the design of the physical, medium access control and network layers, to the field demonstrations. The paper also covers the business models that can be used to make the deployment of this technology a reality.},

pages={2732-2747},
abstract={The broadcast nature of wireless communications exposes various transmission attributes, such as the packet size, inter-packet times, and the modulation scheme. These attributes can be exploited by an adversary to launch passive (e.g., traffic analysis) or selective jamming attacks. This security problem is present even when frame headers and payloads can be encrypted. For example, by determining the modulation scheme, the attacker can estimate the data rate, and hence the payload size. In this paper, we propose Friendly CryptoJam (FCJ), a scheme that decorrelates the payload's modulation scheme from other transmission attributes by embedding information symbols into the constellation map of the highest-order modulation scheme supported by the system (a concept we refer to as indistinguishable modulation unification). Such unification is done using the least-complex trellis-coded modulation schemes, which are combined with a secret pseudo-random sequence in FCJ to conceal the rate-dependent pattern imposed by the code. It also preserves the bit error rate performance of the payload's original modulation scheme. At the same time, modulated symbols are encrypted to hide PHY-/MAC layer fields. To identify the Tx and synchronously generate the secret sequence at the Tx and Rx, an efficient identifier embedding technique based on Barker sequences is proposed, which exploits the structure of the preamble and overlays a frame-specific identifier on it. We study the implications of the scheme on PHY-layer functions through simulations and testbed experiments. Our results confirm the efficiency of FCJ in hiding the targeted attributes.},

abstract={As Cloud Computing becomes the trend of information technology computational model, the Cloud security is becoming a major issue in adopting the Cloud where security is considered one of the most critical concerns for the large customers of Cloud (i.e. governments and enterprises). Such valid concern is mainly driven by the Multi-Tenancy situation which refers to resource sharing in Cloud Computing and its associated risks where confidentiality and/or integrity could be violated. As a result, security concerns may harness the advancement of Cloud Computing in the market. So, in order to propose effective security solutions and strategies a good knowledge of the current Cloud implementations and practices, especially the public Clouds, must be understood by professionals. Such understanding is needed in order to recognize attack vectors and attack surfaces. In this paper we will propose an attack model based on a threat model designed to take advantage of Multi-Tenancy situation only. Before that, a clear understanding of Multi-Tenancy, its origin and its benefits will be demonstrated. Also, a novel way on how to approach Multi-Tenancy will be illustrated. Finally, we will try to sense any suspicious behavior that may indicate to a possible attack where we will try to recognize the proposed attack model empirically from Google trace logs. Google trace logs are a 29-day worth of data released by Google. The data set was utilized in reliability and power consumption studies, but not been utilized in any security study to the extent of our knowledge.},

abstract={Lateral movement-based attacks are increasingly leading to compromises in large private and government networks, often resulting in information exfiltration or service disruption. Such attacks are often slow and stealthy and usually evade existing security products. To enable effective detection of such attacks, we present a new approach based on graph-based modeling of the security state of the target system and correlation of diverse indicators of anomalous host behavior. We believe that irrespective of the specific attack vectors used, attackers typically establish a command and control channel to operate, and move in the target system to escalate their privileges and reach sensitive areas. Accordingly, we identify important features of command and control and lateral movement activities and extract them from internal and external communication traffic. Driven by the analysis of the features, we propose the use of multiple anomaly detection techniques to identify compromised hosts. These methods include Principal Component Analysis, k-means clustering, and Median Absolute Deviation-based outlier detection. We evaluate the accuracy of identifying compromised hosts by using injected attack traffic in a real enterprise network dataset, for various attack communication models. Our results show that the proposed approach can detect infected hosts with high accuracy and a low false positive rate.},

abstract={With the proliferation of mobile devices and various sensors (e.g., GPS, magnetometer, accelerometers, gyroscopes) equipped, richer services, e.g. location based services, are provided to users. A series of methods have been proposed to protect the users' privacy, especially the trajectory privacy. Hardware fingerprinting has been demonstrated to be a surprising and effective source for identifying/authenticating devices. In this work, we show that a few data samples collected from the motion sensors are enough to uniquely identify the source mobile device, i.e., the raw motion sensor data serves as a fingerprint of the mobile device. Specifically, we first analytically understand the fingerprinting capacity using features extracted from hardware data. To capture the essential device feature automatically, we design a multi-LSTM neural network to fingerprint mobile device sensor in real-life uses, instead of using handcrafted features by existing work. Using data collected over 6 months, for arbitrary user movements, our fingerprinting model achieves 93 % F -score given one second data, while the state-of-the-art work achieves 79% F-score. Given ten seconds randomly sampled data, our model can achieve 98.8% accuracy. We also propose a novel generative model to modify the original sensor data and yield anonymized data with little fingerprint information while retain good data utility.},

abstract={With the development of smart phones, more and more mobile phone malwares have came out in the market especially on the popular platforms such as Android, which can potentially cause harm to users' information. But how to effectively detect the new malwares and malicious software variants has been a difficult problem. In view of the traditional feature extraction method based on binary program, this paper presents a method for feature extraction of JAVA source code. The method uses the Keywords Correlation Distance to compute the correlation between key codes such as API calls, Android permissions, the common parameters, and the common key words in Android malware source code. Then SVM is applied to make the system gain to accommodate the function of the new malicious software sample, so as to detect new malicious software and existing malwares. This method is different from the conventional methods which are based on the context of the text. This method combines the characteristics of the malicious software categories and operating environment to record the behavior of the malicious software. Experiments show that the method is efficient and effective in detecting malwares on Android platform.},

abstract={Although image translation algorithms such as StarGAN, STGAN, StarGAN-v2, etc. based on the generative adversarial networks, bring enormous convenience to people's work and life, they also have greater security risks in terms of privacy and security ethics. We tackle this problem of generating adversarial attacks against image translation models, which disrupt the resulting output image. The existing adversarial technology can only generate adversarial samples for a single image translation model, but in actual applications, it is unknown to the user which model an attacker will use. The paper draws on the idea of multi-task learning and proposes a multi-objective adversarial sample generation algorithm to generate images that can simultaneously defend against tampering with multiple state- of-the-art image translation models. The simulation result shows that compared with the original images, adversarial images have no heavy visual distortion with PSNR of 27.17dB and SSIM of 0.70 which means that normal usages of images, such as showing something interesting, amazing, funny, cool or etc., are not affected. The adversarial samples generated by our proposed algorithm reduce the risk of malicious tampering and abuse of images. For the mainstream image translation models StarGAN, STGAN and StarGAN-v2, the attack success rates of the adversarial images generated by the algorithm are 100%, 66.67%, and 73.33%, respectively. It can be seen that the algorithm in this paper has obvious effects on protecting the reasonable and safe use of multimedia resources on social platforms.},

This paper proposes a new adversarial sample defense model based on attention mechanism, which used LSTM network to get the key features. Firstly, we describe our model which recognizes an object through enough main characteristics. It can discard large parts of the noise distributed throughout the image area. Secondly, we show recognition process of the model, receiving adversarial samples and then outputting the salient mask image which can be classified correctly by neural networks in deep learning. At last, we designed experiments to test model effect on the traffic sign and the general picture. The experimental results show that our defense model can strongly defend adversarial examples.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples - maliciously crafted inputs to trigger target DL models to misbehave - which significantly hinders the application of DL in security-sensitive domains. Intensive research on adversarial learning has led to an arms race between adversaries and defenders. Such plethora of emerging attacks and defenses raise many questions: Which attacks are more evasive, preprocessing-proof, or transferable? Which defenses are more effective, utility-preserving, or general? Are ensembles of multiple defenses more robust than individuals? Yet, due to the lack of platforms for comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attacks and defenses, these critical questions remain largely unsolved. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of DEEPSEC, a uniform platform that aims to bridge this gap. In its current implementation, DEEPSEC incorporates 16 state-of-the-art attacks with 10 attack utility metrics, and 13 state-of-the-art defenses with 5 defensive utility metrics. To our best knowledge, DEEPSEC is the first platform that enables researchers and practitioners to (i) measure the vulnerability of DL models, (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of various attacks/defenses, and (iii) conduct comparative studies on attacks/defenses in a comprehensive and informative manner. Leveraging DEEPSEC, we systematically evaluate the existing adversarial attack and defense methods, and draw a set of key findings, which demonstrate DEEPSEC's rich functionality, such as (1) the trade-off between misclassification and imperceptibility is empirically confirmed; (2) most defenses that claim to be universally applicable can only defend against limited types of attacks under restricted settings; (3) it is not necessary that adversarial examples with higher perturbation magnitude are easier to be detected; (4) the ensemble of multiple defenses cannot improve the overall defense capability, but can improve the lower bound of the defense effectiveness of individuals. Extensive analysis on DEEPSEC demonstrates its capabilities and advantages as a benchmark platform which can benefit future adversarial learning research.},

Regional subsystems are partitioned via the K-means method. Second, a novel distributed state estimation method integrated with the characteristics of data deception attacks and denial of service (DoS) attacks is proposed to account for the simultaneous presence of different cyber attacks on individual regional subsystems. Third, the convergence of a distributed state estimation algorithm under hybrid cyber attacks is proved theoretically. Furthermore, the relationships between the convergence and algorithm parameters as well as the occurring probability of DoS attacks are established. Finally, the simulations on a modified IEEE 118-bus system are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The communication and networking field is hungry for machine learning decision-making solutions to replace the traditional model-driven approaches that proved to be not rich enough for seizing the ever-growing complexity and heterogeneity of the modern systems in the field. Traditional machine learning solutions assume the existence of (cloud-based) central entities that are in charge of processing the data. Nonetheless, the difficulty of accessing private data, together with the high cost of transmitting raw data to the central entity gave rise to a decentralized machine learning approach called Federated Learning. The main idea of federated learning is to perform an on-device collaborative training of a single machine learning model without having to share the raw training data with any third-party entity. Although few survey articles on federated learning already exist in the literature, the motivation of this survey stems from three essential observations. The first one is the lack of a fine-grained multi-level classification of the federated learning literature, where the existing surveys base their classification on only one criterion or aspect. The second observation is that the existing surveys focus only on some common challenges, but disregard other essential aspects such as reliable client selection, resource management and training service pricing. The third observation is the lack of explicit and straightforward directives for researchers to help them design future federated learning solutions that overcome the state-of-the-art research gaps. To address these points, we first provide a comprehensive tutorial on federated learning and its associated concepts, technologies and learning approaches. We then survey and highlight the applications and future directions of federated learning in the domain of communication and networking. Thereafter, we design a three-level classification scheme that first categorizes the federated learning literature based on the high-level challenge that they tackle. Then, we classify each high-level challenge into a set of specific low-level challenges to foster a better understanding of the topic. Finally, we provide, within each low-level challenge, a fine-grained classification based on the technique used to address this particular challenge. For each category of high-level challenges, we provide a set of desirable criteria and future research directions that are aimed to help the research community design innovative and efficient future solutions. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the most comprehensive in terms of challenges and techniques it covers and the most fine-grained in terms of the multi-level classification scheme it presents.},

abstract={Minimization of disclosure risks is a key challenge in publicly available visualizations that can potentially reveal personal information. Such risks are inherently dependent on the amount of information that adversaries can gain by manipulating visual representations and by using their background knowledge. Conventional risk quantification models proposed in the field of privacy-preserving data mining suffer from a lack of transparency in letting data owners control privacy parameters and understand their implications for disclosure risks. To fill this gap, we propose a visual uncertainty model for letting data owners understand the relationships between privacy parameters and vulnerable visualization configurations. Our main contribution is a probabilistic analysis of the disclosure risks associated with vulnerabilities in privacy-preserving parallel coordinates and scatter plots. We quantify the relationship among attack scenarios, adversarial knowledge, and the inherent uncertainty in cluster-based visualizations that can act as defense mechanisms. We present examples and a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.},

abstract={We compare the robustness of image classifiers based on state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with classifiers based on a model of cortical development using a single layer of sparse coding. The comparison is based on the ability of the two distinct types of classifiers to distinguish between faces of celebrities from the CelebA dataset and synthetic faces created by the ProGAN multi-scale GAN, trained on the same CelebA images. We examine the robustness of DNNs compared to classifiers based on sparse coding after the addition of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which fool most or all of the DNN classifiers we examined. Our results show that simple classifiers based on sparse coding are robust to UAPs that substantially degrade performance across a wide range of DNN architectures. We hypothesize that sparse latent representations, which correspond to fixed points of a dynamical attractor-or Hopfield network-are naturally denoising and remove small adversarial perturbations. We observe that analogous but reduced robustness is conferred by deep denoising autoencoders. Our results suggest that DNN-based classifiers may be designed to rely on more robust features, and thus may be less susceptible to adversarial attacks, if preceded by a denoising pre-processing layer.},

In an effort to combat Web-based APT, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm, Web-APT-Detect (WAD), which implements self-translation machine through an encoder-decoder using attention mechanism. Our attention mechanisms can improve the quality of self-translation machine used to detect malicious patterns in HTTP requests.

abstract={5G New Radio (NR) allows enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) to coexist in the physical layer for better resource utilization. To enable the coexistence while satisfying the QoS requirement of URLLC, 3GPP introduces the cancellation mechanism that allows a URLLC UE to preempt the transmission of eMBB UEs. In this paper, we show that the 3GPP design to provide stringent QoS guarantee for URLLC may become a threat to interfere both eMBB and URLLC via highly synchronized low-volume DDoS. We dissect potential vulnerability for both eMBB and URLLC UEs in the uplink from the 3GPP standards. An attack model is investigated and evaluated through system-level simulations. We find that synchronization among compromised URLLC UEs could be leveraged by the attacker to amplify the overall impact on both eMBB throughput and URLLC latency, even when the number of compromised UEs is small.},

year={2021},
volume={16},
number={},
pages={1841-1854},
abstract={Recent research has demonstrated that lip-based speaker authentication systems can not only achieve good authentication performance but also guarantee liveness. However, with modern DeepFake technology, attackers can produce the talking video of a user without leaving any visually noticeable fake traces. This can seriously compromise traditional face-based or lip-based authentication systems. To defend against sophisticated DeepFake attacks, a new visual speaker authentication scheme based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed in this paper. The proposed network is composed of two functional parts, namely, the Fundamental Feature Extraction network (FFE-Net) and the Representative lip feature extraction and Classification network (RC-Net). The FFE-Net provides the fundamental information for speaker authentication. As the static lip shape and lip appearance is vulnerable to DeepFake attacks, the dynamic lip movement is emphasized in the FFE-Net. The RC-Net extracts high-level lip features that discriminate against human imposters while capturing the client's talking style. A multi-task learning scheme is designed, and the proposed network is trained end-to-end. Experiments on the GRID and MOBIO datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to achieve an accurate authentication result against human imposters and is much more robust against DeepFake attacks compared to three state-of-the-art visual speaker authentication algorithms. It is also worth noting that the proposed approach does not require any prior knowledge of the DeepFake spoofing method and thus can be applied to defend against different kinds of DeepFake attacks.},

abstract={For autonomous driving, an essential task is to detect surrounding objects accurately. To this end, most existing systems use optical devices, including cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, to collect environment data in real time. In recent years, many researchers have developed advanced machine learning models to detect surrounding objects. Nevertheless, the aforementioned optical devices are vulnerable to optical signal attacks, which could compromise the accuracy of object detection. To address this critical issue, we propose a framework to detect and identify sensors that are under attack. Specifically, we first develop a new technique to detect attacks on a system that consists of three sensors. Our main idea is to: 1) use data from three sensors to obtain two versions of depth maps (i.e., disparity) and 2) detect attacks by analyzing the distribution of disparity errors. In our study, we use real data sets and the state-of-the-art machine learning model to evaluate our attack detection scheme and the results confirm the effectiveness of our detection method. Based on the detection scheme, we further develop an identification model that is capable of identifying up to n-2 attacked sensors in a system with one LiDAR and n cameras. We prove the correctness of our identification scheme and conduct experiments to show the accuracy of our identification method. Finally, we investigate the overall sensitivity of our framework.},

After many years of research, it is widely acknowledged that system calls are the preferred data source for HIDS. In a recent paper, a novel semantic analysis approach was proposed and shown to achieve the best performance, as compared with various previous syntactic analysis schemes. The performance difference is profound for modern attacks. However, the semantic analysis approach requires considerable computational complexity. In this paper, we present a deep learning architecture which requires no data pre-processing and is easy to train.

abstract={Nowadays, wireless network security has a considerable attention. However, wireless communication faces several security threats. Consequently, several security efforts have been exerted to combat the wireless attacks, but unfortunately complete attack prevention is not realistically attainable. Thus, the emphasis on detecting intrusions through a second line of defense, in the form of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), is increasing. Selecting an effective and appropriate IDS system should take its functionality and performance evaluation into account. Unbiased and reliable evaluation necessarily depends on a well-engineered evaluation methodology. Dealing with this challenge, this paper proposed a holistic methodology for IDSs evaluation in wireless networks. Our methodology includes all necessary and sufficient tasks for IDSs evaluation. Also, we present holistic taxonomies of wireless IDSs and wireless security attacks from the perspective of the IDS evaluator.},

abstract={Recent studies concerning Spiking Neural Networks show that they are a powerful tool for multiple applications as pattern recognition, image tracking, and detection tasks. The basic functional properties of SNN reside in the use of spike information encoding as the neurons are specifically designed and trained using spike trains. We present a novel and efficient frequency encoding algorithm with Gabor-like receptive fields using probabilistic methods and targeted to FPGA for online pro-cessing. The proposed encoding is versatile, modular and, when applied to images, it is able to perform simple image transforms as edge detection, spot detection or removal, and Gabor-like filtering without any further computation requirements. The algorithm is implemented in FPGA and ready to be used in embedded systems, being capable of processing images or video stream up to 40 megapixel per second per single core. Results show an improvement in hardware occupation and encoding speed up to 2.5x over existing state of the art implementations.},

abstract={Finger vein based biometric recognition has increasingly generated interest amongst biometric researchers because of the accuracy, robustness and anti-spoofing propertie. Prior efforts the are documented in the finger vein biometrics literature have only investigated the ventral vein pattern that is formed on the lower part of the finger underneath the skin surface. This paper investigates a new finger vein biometric approach by exploring the vein pattern that is present in the dorsal finger region. Thus, the dorsal finger vein pattern can be used as an independent biometric characteristic useful for the recognition of the target subject. We presented a complete automated approach with the key steps of image capturing, Region of Interest (ROI) extraction, pre-processing to enhance the vein pattern, feature extraction and comparison. This paper also introduces a new database of dorsal finger vein patterns from 125 subjects that resulted in 500 unique fingers with 10 samples each that results in a total of 5000 dorsal finger vein samples. Extensive experiments carried out on our new dorsal finger vein database achieve promising accuracy and thereby provide new insights on this new biometric approach.},

abstract={In robotic systems, the physical world is highly coupled with cyberspace. New threats affect cyber-physical systems as they rely on several sensors to perform critical operations. The most sensitive targets are their location systems, where spoofing attacks can force robots to behave incorrectly. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection approach for sensor spoofing attacks, based on an auto-encoder architecture. After initial training, the detection algorithm works directly on the compressed data by computing the reconstruction errors. We focus on spoofing attacks on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems. We tested our anomaly detection approach against several types of spoofing attacks comparing four different compression rates for the auto-encoder. Our approach has a 99% True Positive rate and a 10% False Negative rate for the 83% compression rate. However, a compression rate of 41% could handle almost all of the same attacks while using half the data.},

pages={63966-63979},
abstract={In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved as a research field that transforms human lifestyle from traditional to sophisticated. In IoT, the network plays a crucial role in collecting data from sensors and moving to the sink. Increasing the network lifetime is a challenging task in IoT, which is connected to devices that are limited by resource. Clustering is one of the effective methods of increasing the network lifetime. However, improper cluster head (CH) selection easily drains the energy early in network nodes. With the aim to overcome the issue, this paper proposes the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic-based Particle Swarm Optimization (T2FL-PSO) algorithm to select the optimal CH to extend the network lifetime. The T2FL is highly useful in providing the accurate solution in uncertain network environments. Hence, T2FL is applied on the network parameters, residual energy, and the distance between sensor node and base station to determine the fitness value. Later, virtual clusters are formed on the basis of distance between sensor node and CH and between node and base station. To validate the performance of the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm, extensive simulations are carried out using MATLAB 2019a. Furthermore, the proposed T2FL-PSO algorithm is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization Clustering (PSO-C) and Particle Swarm Optimization Wang Zhang (PSO-WZ). The result confirms that the proposed T2FL-PSO increases the network lifetime by 10%–15% and the packet transmission ratio by 10%. Compared with similar algorithms, the proposed T2FL-PSO also causes a higher increase of network lifetime.},

abstract={Ophthalmologists typically acquire different image modalities to diagnose eye pathologies. They comprise, e.g., Fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Yet, these images are often complementary and do express the same pathologies in a different way. Some pathologies are only visible in a particular modality. Thus, it is beneficial for the ophthalmologist to have these modalities fused into a single patient-specific model. The goal of this paper is a fusion of Fundus photography with segmented MRI volumes. This adds information to MRI that was not visible before like vessels and the macula. This paper contributions include automatic detection of the optic disc, the fovea, the optic axis, and an automatic segmentation of the vitreous humor of the eye.},

abstract={IoT devices are increasingly deployed in daily life. Many of these devices are, however, vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. As a result, many networks already have vulnerable IoT devices that are easy to compromise. This has led to a new category of malware specifically targeting IoT devices. However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not effective in detecting compromised IoT devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present DÏoT, an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised IoT devices. DÏoT builds effectively on device-type-specific communication profiles without human intervention nor labeled data that are subsequently used to detect anomalous deviations in devices' communication behavior, potentially caused by malicious adversaries. DÏoT utilizes a federated learning approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection. Consequently, DÏoT can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf IoT devices over a long term and show that DÏoT is highly effective (95.6% detection rate) and fast (257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the infamous Mirai malware. DÏoT reported no false alarms when evaluated in a real-world smart home deployment setting.},

abstract={This conference paper explores the characteristics of publications related to the topic of digital business models (DBM). In this review science mapping techniques were applied to review 146 SCOPUS indexed articles and conference papers concerned with the implementation of DBM. Digitization and its rapid evolution are creating new products, changing customer demands and disrupting traditional markets. Hence, the focus of many companies up to date has been on the adoption of emergent technologies, such as internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, big-data or cloud computing. Yet in order to stay competitive and to avoid disruption by a new market entrant a firm needs to adapt and even redesign its core business model in the context of the digital age. However, successfully implementing a digital business model remains one of today's most challenging tasks. The aim of this review is to reveal the size, growth trajectory and geographic distribution of the digital business model knowledge base. Moreover, the goal is to detect key journals, authors and publications, as well as to give an overview of the intellectual structure of the literature and possibly highlight actual trends in the domain of DBM. The review attested a modest-sized knowledge base concentrated in Western countries. Furthermore, four `schools of thoughts' were identified and further explained. It is a first attempt of a bibliometric review in this field, and thus shall give guidance for future research and practical implications.},

abstract={In this paper, the impacts of various data integrity attacks on the power electronic hardware present in an EV charger are comprehensively analyzed in order to provide necessary recommendations to defend against cyberattacks on electric vehicles and their onboard charging (OBC) systems. The adverse scenarios arising due to cyberattacks are carefully reviewed in this study, which includes (a) interfering with the main charger controller (FPGA) logic and its data, (b) establishing fake communication between the charging controller and other electronic control units (ECUs) connected over same controller area network (CAN) bus, and (c) interfering with the battery management system functionalities. A 6.6kW interleaved totem-pole PFC front-end followed by a high frequency DC-DC converter is used as our OBC representative system in this analysis. Possibilities and ways of potential cyberattacks on this model are investigated in detail. Effort is made towards providing software as well as hardware design-level protection mechanisms to mitigate the malicious effects of such cyberattacks on the OBC hardware. This system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the fault occurrences under various data integrity attacks as well as to validate the effectiveness of our proposed countermeasure approaches. Quantitative analyses of the obtained results clearly demonstrate that if adequate precautionary measures are properly taken while designing the charging architecture (e.g., implementing intelligence to the main controller), any electrical hazard or deterioration of health of the components can be avoided to the maximum extent under the circumstances of a malicious cyberattack.},

abstract={Indoor location-based services have been widely investigated to take advantage of semantic trajectories for providing user oriented services in indoor environments. Although indoor semantic trajectories can provide seamless understanding to users regarding the provided location-based services, studies on the application of deep learning approaches for robust and valid semantic indoor localization are lacking. In this study, we combined a stacked denoising autoencoder and long short term memory technique with a rule-based refinement method applying a rule-based hidden Markov model (HMM) to perform robust and valid semantic trajectory extraction. In particular, our rule-based HMM approach incorporates a direct set of rules into HMM to resolve invalid movements of the extracted semantic trajectories and is extensible to various deep learning techniques. We compared the performance of our proposed approach with that of other cutting-edge deep learning approaches on two different real-world data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach to produce more robust and valid semantic trajectories.},

abstract={Third-party libraries (TPLs) have become a significant part of the Android ecosystem. Developers can employ various TPLs with different functionalities to facilitate their app development. Unfortunately, the popularity of TPLs also brings new challenges and even threats. TPLs may carry malicious or vulnerable code, which can infect popular apps to pose threats to mobile users. Besides, the code of third-party libraries could constitute noises in some downstream tasks (e.g., malware and repackaged app detection). Thus, researchers have developed various tools to identify TPLs. However, no existing work has studied these TPL detection tools in detail; different tools focus on different applications with performance differences, but little is known about them. To better understand existing TPL detection tools and dissect TPL detection techniques, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to fill the gap by evaluating and comparing all publicly available TPL detection tools based on four criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, code obfuscation-resilience capability, and ease of use. We reveal their advantages and disadvantages based on a systematic and thorough empirical study. Furthermore, we also conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of each tool. The results showthat LibScout outperforms others regarding effectiveness, LibRadar takes less time than others and is also regarded as the most easy-to-use one, and LibPecker performs the best in defending against code obfuscation techniques. We further summarize the lessons learned from different perspectives, including users, tool implementation, and researchers. Besides, we enhance these open-sourced tools by fixing their limitations to improve their detection ability. We also build an extensible framework that integrates all existing available TPL detection tools, providing online service for the research community. We make publicly available the evaluation dataset and enhanced tools. We believe our work provides a clear picture of existing TPL detection techniques and also give a road-map for future directions.},

For template creation, we modify Gradient Response Maps and propose Gradient Orientation Maps, where Non-Maximum Suppression and Dual Threshold Algorithm are applied. And we adopt image pyramid searching method for fast template matching. Next, the approximate object pose associated with each detected template is used as a starting point for fine pose estimation with Iterative Closest Point algorithm. Thirdly, we improve the accuracy of fine pose estimation by using point cloud filter. Experimental results show that our approach is more robust to estimate the pose of texture-less objects with partial foreground occlusions.},

Several studies have highlighted the threats of big data on different platforms and the countermeasures to reduce the risks caused by attacks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing threats which violate privacy aspects and security issues inflicted by big data as a primary driving force within the AI/ML workflow. We define an adversarial model to investigate the attacks. Additionally, we analyze and summarize the defense strategies and countermeasures of these attacks. Furthermore, due to the impact of AI systems in the market and the vast majority of business sectors, we also investigate Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) that are actively involved in providing guidelines to protect the privacy and ensure the security of big data and AI systems. Our far-reaching goal is to bridge the research and standardization frame to increase the consistency and efficiency of AI systems developments guaranteeing customer satisfaction while transferring a high degree of trustworthiness.},

abstract={Recently researchers have proposed using deep learning-based systems for malware detection. Unfortunately, all deep learning classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial learning-based attacks, or adversarial attacks, where miscreants can avoid detection by the classification algorithm with very few perturbations of the input data. Previous work has studied adversarial attacks against static analysis-based malware classifiers which only classify the content of the unknown file without execution. However, since the majority of malware is either packed or encrypted, malware classification based on static analysis often fails to detect these types of files. To overcome this limitation, anti-malware companies typically perform dynamic analysis by emulating each file in the anti-malware engine or performing in-depth scanning in a virtual machine. These strategies allow the analysis of the malware after unpacking or decryption. In this work, we study different strategies of crafting adversarial samples for dynamic analysis. These strategies operate on sparse, binary inputs in contrast to continuous inputs such as pixels in images. We then study the effects of two, previously proposed defensive mechanisms against crafted adversarial samples including the distillation and ensemble defenses. We also propose and evaluate the weight decay defense. Experiments show that with these three defenses, the number of successfully crafted adversarial samples is reduced compared to an unprotected baseline system. In particular, the ensemble defense is the most resilient to adversarial attacks. Importantly, none of the defenses significantly reduce the classification accuracy for detecting malware. Finally, we show that while adding additional hidden layers to neural models does not significantly improve the malware classification accuracy, it does significantly increase the classifier's robustness to adversarial attacks.},

For performance evaluation, the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC of Datasets (1 to 3) were compared, and two experiments showed improved overall performance by at least 10.6 % and up to 16.1 % compared to previous studies in terms of the performance evaluation for each feature, comparison of variations in maximum performance, comparison of variations in performance of each feature, and comparison of variations in overall performance. Moreover, the best accuracy, which represents the probability of password exposure, was 96.7 %, which suggests that our proposed attack method has a higher accuracy than the previous study (96.2 %). In conclusion, we demonstrated that password authentication is neutralized by stealing the user password more effectively. For future research, we will focus on improving the attack success rate with respect to accuracy and overall performance numbers, using not only machine learning, but also deep learning.},

abstract={Although face-to-face communication includes the richest information, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients cannot smoothly communicate with others and express their emotions because of paralyzed muscles. Therefore, the N170 responses of EEG signals were analyzed to detect face stimuli in real time. We also proposed an analytical method for feature extraction of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the bag of features scheme to overcome the general difficulty in setting of kernel parameters of SVM. The proposed method resulted in a constantly high accuracy in the face classification; the SVM classifier based on image pattern recognition in the time frequency domain efficiently enables easier setting of the non-linear kernel parameter. Further studies will be required to apply the proposed method for feature extraction to practical devices.},

abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) models are known to be vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial examples and to out-of-distribution inputs drawn sufficiently far away from the training data. How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This article presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs. Evaluated using 11 popular adversarial attacks and two representative out-of-distribution datasets, we show that XEnsemble achieves a high defense success rate against adversarial examples and a high detection success rate against out-of-distribution data inputs, and outperforms existing representative defense methods with respect to robustness and defensibility.},

abstract={The domain of securing in-vehicle networks has attracted both academic and industrial researchers due to high danger of attacks on drivers and passengers. While securing wired and wireless interfaces is important to defend against these threats, detecting attacks is still the critical phase to construct a robust secure system. There are only a few results on securing communication inside vehicles using anomaly-detection techniques despite their efficiencies in systems that need real-time detection. Therefore, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for Controller Area Networks (CAN) bus. This IDS divides data according to the ID field of CAN packets using K-means clustering algorithm, then it extracts suitable features and uses them to train and construct the neural network. The proposed IDS works for each ID separately and finally it combines their individual decisions to construct the final score and generates alert in the presence of attack. The strength of our intrusion detection method is that it works simultaneously for two types of attacks which will eliminate the use of several separate IDS and thus reduce the complexity and cost of implementation.},

abstract={Deep learning plays an increasingly important role in various fields due to its superior performance, and it also achieves advanced recognition performance in the field of image classification. However, the vulnerability of deep learning in the adversarial environment cannot be ignored, and the prediction result of the model is likely to be affected by the small perturbations added to the samples by the adversary. In this paper, we propose a two-layer dynamic defense method based on defensive techniques pool and retrained branch model pool. First, we randomly select defense methods from the defense pool to process the input. The perturbation ability of the adversarial samples preprocessed by different defense methods changed, which would produce different classification results. In addition, we conduct adversarial training based on the original model and dynamically generate multiple branch models. The classification results of these branch models for the same adversarial sample is inconsistent. We can detect the adversarial samples by using the inconsistencies in the output results of the two layers. The experimental results show that the two-layer dynamic defense method we designed achieves a good defense effect.},

abstract={Several successful adversarial attacks have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of deep learning algorithms. These attacks are detrimental in building deep learning based dependable AI applications. Therefore, it is imperative to build a defense mechanism to protect the integrity of deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel "defense layer" in a network which aims to block the generation of adversarial noise and prevents an adversarial attack in black-box and gray-box settings. The parameter-free defense layer, when applied to any convolutional network, helps in achieving protection against attacks such as FGSM, L2, Elastic-Net, and DeepFool. Experiments are performed with different CNN architectures, including VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, on three databases, namely, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and PaSC. The results showcase the efficacy of the proposed defense layer without adding any computational overhead. For example, on the CIFAR-10 database, while the attack can reduce the accuracy of the ResNet-50 model to as low as 6.3%, the proposed "defense layer" retains the original accuracy of 81.32%.},

abstract={Designing a controller for autonomous vehicles capable of providing adequate performance in all driving scenarios is challenging due to the highly complex environment and inability to test the system in the wide variety of scenarios which it may encounter after deployment. However, deep learning methods have shown great promise in not only providing excellent performance for complex and non-linear control problems, but also in generalising previously learned rules to new scenarios. For these reasons, the use of deep learning for vehicle control is becoming increasingly popular. Although important advancements have been achieved in this field, these works have not been fully summarised. This paper surveys a wide range of research works reported in the literature which aim to control a vehicle through deep learning methods. Although there exists overlap between control and perception, the focus of this paper is on vehicle control, rather than the wider perception problem which includes tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. The paper identifies the strengths and limitations of available deep learning methods through comparative analysis and discusses the research challenges in terms of computation, architecture selection, goal specification, generalisation, verification and validation, as well as safety. Overall, this survey brings timely and topical information to a rapidly evolving field relevant to intelligent transportation systems.},

At the time, however, new age security attacks on the key components of BCs are emerging, which are very sophisticated and can cause huge irreparable damages, including network-based attacks, consensus & ledger-based at-tacks, smart contract-based attacks, and wallet-based attacks. This paper proposes to use bigraph theory to model BC attack meta-model, and automatically generate attack graphs for BC security evaluation. Bigraphical sorting mechanism is used to depict configuration of BC systems, and bigraphical reaction rules are designed to characterize attack templates and attacker behaviours. Adaptive exploit flow approach is proposed to reduce the complexity of matching algorithm guided by interested attack exploits, and probability is introduced into bigraphs to measure the capability of attackers. Preliminary experiments have shown the validity of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Phishing is a form of cyber attack that leverages social engineering approaches and other sophisticated techniques to harvest personal information from users of websites. The average annual growth rate of the number of unique phishing websites detected by the Anti Phishing Working Group is 36.29% for the past six years and 97.36% for the past two years. In the wake of this rise, alleviating phishing attacks has received a growing interest from the cyber security community. Extensive research and development have been conducted to detect phishing attempts based on their unique content, network, and URL characteristics. Existing approaches differ significantly in terms of intuitions, data analysis methods, as well as evaluation methodologies. This warrants a careful systematization so that the advantages and limitations of each approach, as well as the applicability in different contexts, could be analyzed and contrasted in a rigorous and principled way. This paper presents a systematic study of phishing detection schemes, especially software based ones. Starting from the phishing detection taxonomy, we study evaluation datasets, detection features, detection techniques, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we provide insights that we believe will help guide the development of more effective and efficient phishing detection schemes.},

abstract={A major challenge in the field of segmentation in digital pathology is given by the high effort for manual data annotations in combination with many sources introducing variability in the image domain. This requires methods that are able to cope with variability without requiring to annotate a large amount of samples for each characteristic. In this paper, we develop approaches based on adversarial models for image-to-image translation relying on unpaired training. Specifically, we propose approaches for stain-independent supervised segmentation relying on image-to-image translation for obtaining an intermediate representation. Furthermore, we develop a fully-unsupervised segmentation approach exploiting image-to-image translation to convert from the image to the label domain. Finally, both approaches are combined to obtain optimum performance in unsupervised segmentation independent of the characteristics of the underlying stain. Experiments on patches showing kidney histology proof that stain-translation can be performed highly effectively and can be used for domain adaptation to obtain independence of the underlying stain. It is even capable of facilitating the underlying segmentation task, thereby boosting the accuracy if an appropriate intermediate stain is selected. Combining domain adaptation with unsupervised segmentation finally showed the most significant improvements.},

abstract={Face recognition in the unconstrained environment is an ongoing research challenge. Although several covariates of face recognition such as pose and low resolution have received significant attention, “disguise” is considered an onerous covariate of face recognition. One of the primary reasons for this is the scarcity of large and representative labeled databases, along with the lack of algorithms that work well for multiple covariates in such environments. In order to address the problem of face recognition in the presence of disguise, the paper proposes an active learning framework termed as A2-LINK. Starting with a face recognition machine-learning model, A2-LINK intelligently selects training samples from the target domain to be labeled and, using hybrid noises such as adversarial noise, fine-tunes a model that works well both in the presence and absence of disguise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed framework on the DFW and DFW2019 datasets with state-of-the-art deep learning featurization models such as LCSSE, ArcFace, and DenseNet.},

abstract={Bot detection using machine learning (ML), with network flow-level features, has been extensively studied in the literature. However, existing flow-based approaches typically incur a high computational overhead and do not completely capture the network communication patterns, which can expose additional aspects of malicious hosts. Recently, bot detection systems that leverage communication graph analysis using ML have gained attention to overcome these limitations. A graph-based approach is rather intuitive, as graphs are true representation of network communications. In this paper, we propose BotChase, a two-phased graph-based bot detection system that leverages both unsupervised and supervised ML. The first phase prunes presumable benign hosts, while the second phase achieves bot detection with high precision. Our prototype implementation of BotChase detects multiple types of bots and exhibits robustness to zero-day attacks. It also accommodates different network topologies and is suitable for large-scale data. Compared to the state-of-the-art, BotChase outperforms an end-to-end system that employs flow-based features and performs particularly well in an online setting.},

abstract={Recently, most wireless network security schemes merely based on physical layer characteristics tackle the two fundamental issues-device authentication and secret key extraction separately. It remains an open problem to simultaneously achieve device authentication and fast secret key extraction merely using wireless physical layer characteristics, without the help of advanced hardware or out-of-band channel. In this paper, we answer this open problem in the setting of wireless body area networks (BANs). We propose MASK-BAN, a lightweight fast authenticated secret key extraction scheme for intra-BAN communication. Our scheme neither introduces advanced hardware nor relies on out-of-band channels. To perform device authentication and fast secret key extraction at the same time, we exploit the heterogeneous channel characteristics among the collection of on-body channels during body motion. On one hand, MASK-BAN achieves authentication through multihop stable channels, which greatly reduces the false positive rate as compared to existing work. On the other hand, based on dynamic channels, key extraction between two on-body devices with multihop relay nodes is modeled as a max-flow problem, and a novel collaborative secret key generation algorithm is introduced to maximize the key generation rate. Extensive real-world experiments on low-end commercial-off-the-shelf sensor devices validate MASK-BAN's great authentication capability and high-secret key generation rate.},

In today’s interconnected realm of computer systems, each attack vector has a network dimension. The present study investigates network intrusion attempts with anomaly-based machine learning models to provide better protection than the conventional misuse-based models. Two models, namely an ensemble learning model and a convolutional neural network model, were built and implemented on a data set gathered from a real-life, institutional production environment.

abstract={As a cyber attack which leverages social engineering and other sophisticated techniques to steal sensitive information from users, phishing attack has been a critical threat to cyber security for a long time. Although researchers have proposed lots of countermeasures, phishing criminals figure out circumventions eventually since such countermeasures require substantial manual feature engineering and can not detect newly emerging phishing attacks well enough, which makes developing an efficient and effective phishing detection method an urgent need. In this work, we propose a novel phishing website detection approach by detecting the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of a website, which is proved to be an effective and efficient detection approach. To be specific, our novel capsule-based neural network mainly includes several parallel branches wherein one convolutional layer extracts shallow features from URLs and the subsequent two capsule layers generate accurate feature representations of URLs from the shallow features and discriminate the legitimacy of URLs. The final output of our approach is obtained by averaging the outputs of all branches. Extensive experiments on a validated dataset collected from the Internet demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive performance against other state-of-the-art detection methods while maintaining a tolerable time overhead.},

abstract={Due to the prevalence of control-flow hijacking attacks, a wide variety of defense methods to protect both user space and kernel space code have been developed in the past years. A few examples that have received widespread adoption include stack canaries, non-executable memory, and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). When implemented correctly (i.e., a given system fully supports these protection methods and no information leak exists), the attack surface is significantly reduced and typical exploitation strategies are severely thwarted. All modern desktop and server operating systems support these techniques and ASLR has also been added to different mobile operating systems recently. In this paper, we study the limitations of kernel space ASLR against a local attacker with restricted privileges. We show that an adversary can implement a generic side channel attack against the memory management system to deduce information about the privileged address space layout. Our approach is based on the intrinsic property that the different caches are shared resources on computer systems. We introduce three implementations of our methodology and show that our attacks are feasible on four different x86-based CPUs (both 32- and 64-bit architectures) and also applicable to virtual machines. As a result, we can successfully circumvent kernel space ASLR on current operating systems. Furthermore, we also discuss mitigation strategies against our attacks, and propose and implement a defense solution with negligible performance overhead.},

abstract={Our world and our lives are changing in many ways. Communication, networking, and computing technologies are among the most influential enablers that shape our lives today. Digital data and connected worlds of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.},

abstract={Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which becomes one of the most important research problems in the development of deep learning. While a lot of efforts have been made in recent years, it is of great significance to perform correct and complete evaluations of the adversarial attack and defense algorithms. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive, rigorous, and coherent benchmark to evaluate adversarial robustness on image classification tasks. After briefly reviewing plenty of representative attack and defense methods, we perform large-scale experiments with two robustness curves as the fair-minded evaluation criteria to fully understand the performance of these methods. Based on the evaluation results, we draw several important findings that can provide insights for future research, including: 1) The relative robustness between models can change across different attack configurations, thus it is encouraged to adopt the robustness curves to evaluate adversarial robustness; 2) As one of the most effective defense techniques, adversarial training can generalize across different threat models; 3) Randomization-based defenses are more robust to query-based black-box attacks.},

abstract={IoT devices are notoriously vulnerable even to trivial attacks and can be easily compromised. In addition, resource constraints and heterogeneity of IoT devices make it impractical to secure IoT installations using traditional endpoint and network security solutions. To address this problem, we present IoT-Keeper, a lightweight system which secures the communication of IoT. IoT-Keeper uses our proposed anomaly detection technique to perform traffic analysis at edge gateways. It uses a combination of fuzzy C-means clustering and fuzzy interpolation scheme to analyze network traffic and detect malicious network activity. Once malicious activity is detected, IoT-Keeper automatically enforces network access restrictions against IoT device generating this activity, and prevents it from attacking other devices or services. We have evaluated IoT-Keeper using a comprehensive dataset, collected from a real-world testbed, containing popular IoT devices. Using this dataset, our proposed technique achieved high accuracy (≈0.98) and low false positive rate (≈0.02) for detecting malicious network activity. Our evaluation also shows that IoT-Keeper has low resource footprint, and it can detect and mitigate various network attacks-without requiring explicit attack signatures or sophisticated hardware.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted in a plethora of applications ranging from simple time-series forecasting to computer security and autonomous systems. Despite the robustness by the ML algorithms against random noise, it has been shown that inclusion of specially crafted perturbations to the input data termed as adversarial samples can lead to a significant degradation in the ML performance. Existing defenses to mitigate or minimize the impact of adversarial samples including adversarial training or randomization are confined to specific categories of adversaries, compute-intensive and/or often lead to reduce performance even without adversaries. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing works on adversarial defense, we propose a two-stage adversarial defense technique (R2 AD). To thwart the exploitation of the deep neural network by the attacker, we first include a random nullification (RNF) layer. The RNF nullifies/removes some of the features from the input randomly to reduce the impact of adversarial noise and minimizes attacker's feasibility to extract the model parameters. However, the removal of input features through RNF leads to a reduction in the performance of the ML. As an antidote, we equip the network with a Reconstructor. The Reconstructor primarily contributes to reconstructing the input data by utilizing an autoencoder network, but based on the distribution of the normal samples, thereby improving the performance, and also being robust to the adversarial noise. We evaluated the performance of proposed multi-stage R2 AD on the MNIST digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets against multiple adversarial attacks including FGSM, JSMA, BIM, Deepfool, and CW attacks. Our findings report improvements as high as 80% in the performance compared to the existing defenses such as adversarial training and randomization-based defense.},

Many of the firewall designs in use today are still signature-based (with very few exceptions just released in 2020), which tend to struggle to protect against zero-day attacks and against encrypted traffic. By applying cellular membrane concepts such as endocytosis and ligand-receptor interactions along with machine learning, we created a feasible next generation firewall prototype capable of defending against zero-day threats even within encrypted traffic. Specifically, we built both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, optimized their results, then we exported the models, and tested the exported models on zero-day malicious network traffic. Finally, we modified the open source Linux IP Tables firewall software to use our exported model as the packet filtering mechanism. The end result was a working host-based, supervised machine learning driven, next generation firewall prototype that demonstrated very promising results, nearly 100% of normal connections were passed and 77% of zero-day malicious connections were blocked.},

abstract={The precision time protocol (PTP) is considered as one of the most favorable mechanisms for providing unified and precise time at the substation level in the smart grid. Nevertheless, PTP was shown to be vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeting its components and synchronization services. In this article, we capitalize on the theory and outcome of our previous work to contribute a more complete solution that addresses PTP cyber security. We propose to close the PTP loop through an extension that introduces new functionality and messages. This extension covers the PTP attack surface and enables the detection of attacks on PTP time synchronization. We formally model and verify the proposed extension using UPPAAL model checker. In addition, we validate the proposed extension using Omnet++ simulation. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach preserves PTP functionality, while successfully detecting cyber attacks against PTP components in a timely manner.},

abstract={Due to its unique characteristics, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are more vulnerable to malicious attack and the absolute security in the mobile ad hoc network is very hard to achieve. Prevention methods as cryptographic techniques alone are not sufficient to make them secure; therefore, efficient intrusion detection must be deployed and elaborated to facilitate the identification of attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect malicious and selfish nodes in a network. The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture. In this paper we give a survey of different architectures and methods of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for MANETs accordingly to the recent literature.},

Meanwhile, the deregulation of the power industry, particularly on the delivery side, has continuously been moving forward worldwide. How to employ massive smart meter data to promote and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the power grid is a pressing issue. To date, substantial works have been conducted on smart meter data analytics. To provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and to identify challenges for future research, this paper conducts an application-oriented review of smart meter data analytics. Following the three stages of analytics, namely, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, we identify the key application areas as load analysis, load forecasting, and load management. We also review the techniques and methodologies adopted or developed to address each application. In addition, we also discuss some research trends, such as big data issues, novel machine learning technologies, new business models, the transition of energy systems, and data privacy and security.},

abstract={Dimension reduction (DR)-based on extreme learning machine auto-encoder (ELM-AE) has achieved many successes in recent years. By minimizing the self-reconstruction error, the ELM-AE-based DR algorithms learn the compressed representations which facilitate the subsequent classification. However, the existing ELM-AEs only consider the DR problem in an unsupervised manner and ignore the valuable supervised information when these information is available. To find discriminative features of the original data, in this paper, we propose a graph embedding-based DR framework with ELM (GDR-ELM) for DR problems. Instead of self-reconstruction, the proposed GDR-ELM reconstructs all samples according to the weights in a graph matrix containing the supervised information. Furthermore, GDR-ELM can be stacked as building blocks to construct a multilayer framework like other ELM-AEs for more complicated representation learning tasks. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GDR-ELM and its multilayer framework.},

abstract={Public-key cryptography (PKC), widely used to protect communication in the Internet of Things (IoT), is the basis for establishing secured communication channels between multiple parties. The foreseeable breakthrough of quantum computers represents a risk for many PKC ecosystems. Almost all approaches in use today rely on the hardness of factoring large integers or computing (elliptic-curve) discrete logarithms. It is known that cryptography based on these problems can be broken in polynomial time by Shors algorithm, once a large enough quantum computer is built. In order to prepare for such an event, the integration of quantum-resistant cryptography on devices operating in the IoT is mandatory to achieve long-term security. Due to their limited resources, tight performance requirements and long-term life-cycles, this is especially challenging for Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) operating in this context. At the same time, it must be provided that well-known implementation attacks, such as those targeting a cipher's execution time or its use of the processor cache, are inhibited, as they've successfully been used to attack cryptosystems in the pre-quantum era. Hence, this work presents an analysis of the security-critical polynomial multiplication routine within the NTRU algorithm and its susceptibility to timing and cache attacks. We also propose two different countermeasures to harden systems with or without caches against said attacks, and include the evaluation of the respective overheads. We demonstrate that security against timing and cache attacks can be achieved with reasonable overheads depending on the chosen parameters of NTRU.},

abstract={Deep learning in combination with improved training techniques and high computational power has led to recent advances in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and to successful robotic RL applications such as in-hand manipulation. However, most robotic RL relies on a well known initial state distribution. In real-world tasks, this information is however often not available. For example, when disentangling waste objects the actual position of the robot w.r.t. the objects may not match the positions the RL policy was trained for. To solve this problem, we present a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL) framework. The ARL framework utilizes an adversary, which is trained to steer the original agent, the protagonist, to challenging states. We train the protagonist and the adversary jointly to allow them to adapt to the changing policy of their opponent. We show that our method can generalize from training to test scenarios by training an end-to-end system for robot control to solve a challenging object disentangling task. Experiments with a KUKA LBR+ 7-DOF robot arm show that our approach outperforms the baseline method in disentangling when starting from different initial states than provided during training.},

abstract={Information leakage via side channels has become a primary security threat to encrypted web traffic. Existing side channel attacks and corresponding countermeasures focus primarily on packet length, packet timing, web object size and web flow size. However, we found that encrypted web traffic can also leak information via network delay between a user and the web sites that she visits. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a novel network-delay based side-channel attack to infer web sites visited by a user. The adversary can utilize pattern recognition techniques to differentiate web sites by measuring sample mean and sample variance of the round-trip time (RTT) between a victim user and web sites. We theoretically analyzed the damage caused by such an adversary and derived closed-form formulae for detection rate, the probability that the adversary correctly recognizes a web site. To defeat this side-channel attack, we proposed several countermeasures. The basic idea is to shape traffic from different web sites so that they have similar RTT statistics. We proposed the strategies based on the k-means clustering and K-Anonymity to ensure that traffic shaping will not cause excessive delay while providing a predictable degree of anonymity. We conducted extensive experiments and our empirical results match our theory very well.},

abstract={The vast attack surface of clouds presents a challenge in deploying scalable and effective defenses. Traditional security mechanisms, which work from inside the VM fail to provide strong protection as attackers can bypass them easily. The only available option is to provide security from the layer below the VM i.e., the hypervisor. Previous works that attempt to secure VMs from "outside" either incur substantial space or compute overheads making them slow and impractical or require modifications to the OS or the application codebase. To address these issues, we propose an anomaly detection fabric for clouds based on system call monitoring, which compresses the stream of system calls at their source making the system scalable and near real-time. Our system requires no modifications to the guest OS or the application making it ideal for the data center setting. Additionally, for robust and early detection of threats, we leverage the notion of VM/container communities that share information about attacks in their early stages to provide immunity to the entire deployment. We make certain aspects of the system flexible so that vendors can tune metrics to offer customized protection to clients based on their workload types. Detailed evaluation on a prototype implementation on KVM substantiates our claims.},

pages={408-416},
abstract={Spearphishing is a prominent targeted attack vector in today's Internet. By impersonating trusted email senders through carefully crafted messages and spoofed metadata, adversaries can trick victims into launching attachments containing malicious code or into clicking on malicious links that grant attackers a foothold into otherwise well-protected networks. Spearphishing is effective because it is fundamentally difficult for users to distinguish legitimate emails from spearphishing emails without additional defensive mechanisms. However, such mechanisms, such as cryptographic signatures, have found limited use in practice due to their perceived difficulty of use for normal users. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to defending users against spearphishing attacks. The approach first builds probabilistic models of both email metadata and stylometric features of email content. Then, subsequent emails are compared to these models to detect characteristic indicators of spearphishing attacks. Several instantiations of this approach are possible, including performing model learning and evaluation solely on the receiving side, or senders publishing models that can be checked remotely by the receiver. Our evaluation of a real data set drawn from 20 email users demonstrates that the approach effectively discriminates spearphishing attacks from legitimate email while providing significant ease-of-use benefits over traditional defenses.},

pages={196-206},
abstract={In mixed-criticality systems, highly critical tasks must be temporally and logically isolated from faults in lower-criticality tasks. Such strict isolation, however, is difficult to ensure even for independent tasks, and has not yet been attained if low- and high-criticality tasks share resources subject to mutual exclusion constraints (e.g., Shared data structures, peripheral I/O devices, or OS services), as it is often the case in practical systems. Taking a pragmatic, systems-oriented point of view, this paper argues that traditional real-time locking approaches are unsuitable in a mixed-criticality context: locking is a cooperative activity and requires trust, which is inherently in conflict with the paramount isolation requirements. Instead, a solution based on resource servers (in the microkernel sense) is proposed, and MC-IPC, a novel synchronous multiprocessor IPC protocol for invoking such servers, is presented. The MC-IPC protocol enables strict temporal and logical isolation among mutually untrusted tasks and thus can be used to share resources among tasks of different criticalities. It is shown to be practically viable with a prototype implementation in LITMUSRT and validated with a case study involving several antagonistic failure modes. Finally, MC-IPC is shown to offer analytical benefits in the context of Vestal's mixed-criticality task model.},

abstract={Data aggregation in WSN is usually done by simple methods such as averaging; these methods are vulnerable to certain attacks. To make trust of data and reputation of sensor nodes will be capable of performing more sophisticated data aggregation algorithm, thus making less vulnerable. Iterative filtering algorithm holds great promise for this purpose. To protect WSN from security issue, we introduce an improved iterative filtering technique. This technique makes them not only collusion robust, but also more accurate and faster converging. Trust and reputation systems have a significant role in supporting the operation of a wide range of distributed systems, from wireless sensor networks and e-commerce infrastructure to social networks, by providing an assessment of trustworthiness of participants in a distributed system. We assume that the stochastic components of sensor errors are independent random variables with a Gaussian distribution; however, our experiments show that our method works quite well for other types of errors without any modification. Moreover, if the error distribution of sensors is either known or estimated, our algorithms can be adapted to other distributions to achieve an optimal performance. In the first stage we provide an initial estimate of two noise parameters for sensor nodes, bias and variance; details of the computations for estimating bias and variance of sensors. We provide an initial estimate of the reputation vector calculated using the MLE, the detailed computation operations. In the third stage of the proposed framework, the initial reputation vector provided in the second stage is used to estimate the trustworthiness of each sensor based on the distance of sensor readings to such initial reputation vector.},

abstract={Decentralized machine learning over peer-to-peer networks is very appealing for it enables to learn personalized models without sharing users data, nor relying on any central server. Peers can improve upon their locally trained model across a network graph of other peers with similar objectives. Whilst they offer an inherently scalable scheme with a very simple cost-efficient learning model, peer-to-peer networks are also fragile. In particular, they can be very easily disrupted by unfairness, free-riding, and adversarial behaviors. In this paper, we present CDPL (Contribution Driven P2P Learning), a novel Byzantine-resilient distributed algorithm to train personalized models across similar peers. We convey theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of CDPL in terms of speed of convergence as well as robustness to Byzantine behavior.},

The security problems faced by tunnel mechanisms such as injection, address spoofing and reflector attack are analyzed, and corresponding countermeasures are concluded into three directions: filter, deep packet inspection (DPI) and IPsec.

abstract={Blockchains are distributed systems, in which security is a critical factor for their success. However, despite their increasing popularity and adoption, there is a lack of standardized models that study blockchain-related security threats. To fill this gap, the main focus of our work is to systematize and extend the knowledge about the security and privacy aspects of blockchains and contribute to the standardization of this domain.We propose the security reference architecture (SRA) for blockchains, which adopts a stacked model (similar to the ISO/OSI) describing the nature and hierarchy of various security and privacy aspects. The SRA contains four layers: (1) the network layer, (2) the consensus layer, (3) the replicated state machine layer, and (4) the application layer. At each of these layers, we identify known security threats, their origin, and countermeasures, while we also analyze several cross-layer dependencies. Next, to enable better reasoning about security aspects of blockchains by the practitioners, we propose a blockchain-specific version of the threat-risk assessment standard ISO/IEC 15408 by embedding the stacked model into this standard. Finally, we provide designers of blockchain platforms and applications with a design methodology following the model of SRA and its hierarchy.},

pages={17404-17418},
abstract={As the Software Define Network (SDN) adopts centralized control logic, it is vulnerable to various types of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. At present, almost all the research work focuses on high-rate DDoS attack against the SDN control layer. Moreover, most of the existing detection methods are effective for high-rate DDoS attack detection of the control layer, while a low-rate DDoS attack against the SDN data layer is highly concealed, and the detection accuracy against this kind of attack is low. In order to improve the detection accuracy of the low-rate DDoS attack against the SDN data layer, this paper studies the mechanism of such attacks, and then proposes a multi-feature DDoS attack detection method based on Factorization Machine (FM). The features extracted from the flow rules are used to detect low-rate DDoS attacks, and the detection of low-rate DDoS attacks based on FM machine learning algorithms is implemented. The experimental results show that the method can effectively detect the low-rate DDoS attack against the SDN data layer, and the detection accuracy reaches 95.80 percent. Because FM algorithm can achieve fine-grained detection for low-rate DDoS attack, which provides a reliable condition for defending against such attacks. Finally, this paper proposes a defense method based on dynamic deletion of flow rules, and carries out experimental simulation and analysis to prove the effectiveness of the defense method, and the success rate of forwarding normal packets reached 97.85 percent.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) models are increasingly built on federated edge participants holding local data. To enable insight extractions without the risk of information leakage, DL training is usually combined with differential privacy (DP). The core theme is to tradeoff learning accuracy by adding statistically calibrated noises, particularly to local gradients of edge learners, during model training. However, this privacy guarantee unfortunately degrades model accuracy due to edge learners’ local noises, and the global noise aggregated at the central server. Existing DP frameworks for edge focus on local noise calibration via gradient clipping techniques, overlooking the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of local gradients, and their aggregated impact on accuracy. In this article, we present a systematical analysis that unveils the influential factors capable of mitigating local and aggregated noises, and design PrivateDL to leverage these factors in noise calibration so as to improve model accuracy while fulfilling privacy guarantee. PrivateDL features on: (i) sampling-based sensitivity estimation for local noise calibration and (ii) combining large batch sizes and critical data identification in global training. We implement PrivateDL on the popular Laplace/Gaussian DP mechanisms and demonstrate its effectiveness using Intel BigDL workloads, i.e., considerably improving model accuracy by up to 5X when comparing against existing DP frameworks.},

abstract={Tor is a famous anonymity communication system for preserving users' online privacy. It supports TCP applications and packs application data into encrypted equal-sized cells to hide some private information of users, such as the running application type (Web, P2P, FTP, Others). The known of application types is harmful because they can be used to reduce the anonymity set and facilitate other attacks. However, unfortunately, the current Tor design cannot conceal certain application behaviors. For example, P2P applications usually upload and download files simultaneously and this behavioral feature is also kept in Tor traffic. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a new attack against Tor, traffic classification attack, which can recognize application types from Tor traffic. An attacker first carefully selects some flow features, e.g., burst volumes and directions to represent the application behaviors and takes advantage of some efficient machine learning algorithm to model different types of applications. Then these established models can be used to classify target's Tor traffic and infer its application type. We have implemented the traffic classification attack on Tor and our experiments validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the attack.},

abstract={Child-robot interaction is an interdisciplinary research area that has been attracting growing interest, primarily focusing on edutainment applications. A crucial factor to the successful deployment and wide adoption of such applications remains the robust perception of the child's multi-modal actions, when interacting with the robot in a natural and untethered fashion. Since robotic sensory and perception capabilities are platform-dependent and most often rather limited, we propose a multiple Kinect-based system to perceive the child-robot interaction scene that is robot-independent and suitable for indoors interaction scenarios. The audio-visual input from the Kinect sensors is fed into speech, gesture, and action recognition modules, appropriately developed in this paper to address the challenging nature of child-robot interaction. For this purpose, data from multiple children are collected and used for module training or adaptation. Further, information from the multiple sensors is fused to enhance module performance. The perception system is integrated in a modular multi-robot architecture demonstrating its flexibility and scalability with different robotic platforms. The whole system, called Multi3, is evaluated, both objectively at the module level and subjectively in its entirety, under appropriate child-robot interaction scenarios containing several carefully designed games between children and robots.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel method is presented for low-latency online action recognition from skeleton data. The introduction of pose based features has reduced viewpoint and anthropometric variations, so differing execution rates and personal styles are the major sources of classification error. Previous work for online action recognition fails to adequately address both execution rate and personal style. To overcome these limitations a compression and fusion of offline action recognition approaches has transpired. Specifically, clustered action manifolds are proposed for low computational latency and template fragment matching with peak key poses are introduced for low observational latency. The style invariance of spatio-temporal manifolds is combined with the execution rate invariance of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method.},

abstract={With the rise of privacy concerns in traditional centralized machine learning services, the federated learning, which incorporates multiple participants to train a global model across their localized training data, has lately received significant attention in both industry and academia. However, recent researches reveal the inherent vulnerabilities of the federated learning for the membership inference attacks that the adversary could infer whether a given data record belongs to the model's training set. Although the state-of-the-art techniques could successfully deduce the membership information from the centralized machine learning models, it is still challenging to infer the membership to a more confined level, user-level. In this paper, We propose a novel user-level inference attack mechanism in federated learning. Specifically, we first give a comprehensive analysis of active and targeted membership inference attacks in the context of the federated learning. Then, by considering a more complicated scenario that the adversary can only passively observe the updating models from different iterations, we incorporate the generative adversarial networks into our method, which can enrich the training set for the final membership inference model. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking approach in the case of single-label and multi-label.},

abstract={Online social networks (OSNs) provide a new dimension to people's lives by giving birth to online societies. OSNs have revolutionized the human experience, but they have also created a platform for attackers to distribute infections and conduct cybercrime. An OSN provides an opportunistic attack platform for cybercriminals through which they can spread infections at a large scale. We describe a category of malware (or attacks) known as socioware that exploits OSN environments for performing unauthorized and nefarious activities. Socioware can be an executable, an extension, an exploit code, etc., that conducts malicious operations in OSNs with serious impact on users. Furthermore, we discuss the socioware taxonomy highlighting the characteristics of socioware to illustrate the design and exploitation tactics of OSN malware. In contrast, insider threats (employees or contractors) are posing a grave threat to organizations, with a motivation to steal critical data and monetize it for financial gains. Insider threats have become a serious concern for many organizations today. We present a complete attack model to demonstrate how an insider threat exploits the online trust and confidentiality by transforming an OSN into a socioware distribution platform that infects other employees' systems. Finally, we discuss security defenses that can be adopted to defend against socioware.},

A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based iterative approach is used for the accurate estimation of the jitter and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are implemented to model the 32 phonemes. The final decision is derived by optimally combining the individual estimates to form vectors that are processed by an LDA based iterative algorithm providing better clustering of healthy and allergic subjects.},

abstract={Cloud datacenters are engineered to meet the requirements of generalised and specialised workloads including mission-critical applications that not only generate tremendous amounts of data traces but also opens opportunities for attackers. The increasing volume and rapid changing behaviour of metric streams (e.g., CPU, network, latency, memory) in the cloud datacenters create difficulties to ensure high availability, security, and performance to cloud service providers. Several anomaly detection techniques have been developed to combat system anomalies in cloud datacenters. By injecting a fraction of well-crafted malicious samples in cloud datacenter traces, attackers can subvert the learning process and results in unacceptable false alarms. These security issues cause threats to all categories of anomaly detection. Hence, it is crucial to assess these techniques against adversaries to improve scalability and robustness. We propose a linear regression-based optimisation framework with the ability to poison data in the training phase and demonstrate its effectiveness on cloud datacenter traces. Finally, we investigate the worst-case analysis of poisoning attacks on robust statistics-based anomaly detection techniques to quantify and assess the detection accuracy. We validate this framework using benchmark resource traces obtained from Yahoo's service cluster as well as traces collected from an experimental testbed with realistic service composition.},

pages={145751-145767},
abstract={Today, cyber attacks are constantly evolving and changing, which makes them harder to detect. In particular, detecting attacks in large-scale networks is very challenging because they require high detection rates under real-time resource constraints. In this paper, we focus on detecting infected Internet of Things (IoT) hosts from domain name system (DNS) traffic data. IoT hosts, such as streaming cameras, printers, air conditioners, are hard to protect, unlike PCs and servers. Enterprises are often unaware of the devices which are connected to the network, their types, makes, and vulnerabilities. Since IoT hosts make use of the DNS protocol, analyzing DNS data can give a broad view of malicious activities, because they abuse the DNS protocol and leave fingerprints as part of their attack vector. In this collaborative research between Ben-Gurion University, and IBM, we establish a novel algorithm to detect infected IoT hosts in large-scale DNS traffic, named Anomaly and Reputation Based Algorithm (ARBA). Its novelty resides in developing a framework that combines host classification and domain reputation in a real-time production environment. ARBA is highly computational efficient and meets real-time requirements in terms of run time and computational complexity. By contrast to existing algorithms, it does not require a massive traffic volume for training, which is of significant interest in detecting infected hosts in real-time. The research was conducted on real live streaming data from IBM internal network traffic, and confirm the algorithm's strong performance in a real-time production environment.},

abstract={One way to combat denial-of-service attacks on cloud-based virtual networks is to use unpredictable network addresses, aiming to increase attacker effort by requiring attackers to search a large IP address space to find a target host. IP address randomization is used by several moving target defenses, relying on the assumption that it is difficult for an attacker to predict newly allocated IP addresses. This paper analyzes whether IP addresses used by cloud providers are unpredictable enough in practice. We analyze the IP address allocation behaviors in two major cloud computing providers (Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform) and find that the actual entropy provided by allocated IP addresses is limited. We evaluate several prediction models, including a simple frequency-based model as well as a Markov process model that produces an address prediction set from time series data of collected IP addresses. Our results show that simple models can reduce the search space for allocated IP addresses and diminish the effectiveness of randomization defenses.},

abstract={The increasing popularity of Android phones and its open app market system have caused the proliferation of malicious Android apps. The increasing sophistication and diversity of the malicious Android apps render the conventional malware detection techniques ineffective, which results in a large number of malicious applications remaining undetected. This calls for more effective techniques for detection and classification of Android malware. Hence, in this paper, we present an Android malicious application detection framework based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Active Learning technologies. In our approach, we extract applications' activities while in execution and map them into a feature set, we then attach timestamps to some features in the set. We show that our novel use of time-dependent behavior tracking can significantly improve the malware detection accuracy. In particular, we build an active learning model using Expected error reduction query strategy to integrate new informative instances of Android malware and retrain the model to be able to do adaptive online learning. We evaluate our model through a set of experiments on the DREBIN benchmark malware dataset. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach can accurately detect malicious applications and improve updatability against new malware.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques provide effective solutions for the detection of many aberrant network traffic patterns and attack flows. However, the validation of these techniques often relies on one training dataset. Recent results show that such training may fail in the face of dynamically-changing cyberattacks. Given the increased sophistication of cyberattacks nowadays, it is imperative to examine and improve the performance of such AI models. This paper proposes a defensive AI engine combined with a twofold feature selection technique and hyperparameter optimization of the AI model. In this work, we utilize the proposed system for binary attack flow identification and the AI models are trained and validated on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The system is then evaluated using synthesized atypical attack flows to mimic real-world scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed atypical attack flow detection approach using several Deep Learning and Machine Learning models including DNN, Linear-SVC, and Stacked Decision Tree Classifier (S-DTC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed defensive AI engine significantly improves the True Positive Rate (TPR) of AI models on multiple atypical attacks.},

abstract={In current enterprise environments, information is becoming more readily accessible across a wide range of interconnected systems. However, trustworthiness of documents and actors is not explicitly measured, leaving actors unaware of how latest security events may have impacted the trustworthiness of the information being used and the actors involved. This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.},

abstract={Privacy concerns on smartphones have been raised by the public as more and more personal data are now stored on them. In this paper, we show that location information can be compromised through mobile inertial sensors which are considered insensitive and accessible by any mobile application in both iOS and Android without special privilege. We present MISSILE, an automatic system that can infer users' indoor location using labeled sensor data as prior knowledge. The key idea is that when a user reaches a particular indoor location, it is very likely that he/she has passed through some unique interior structures of a building, such as winding corridors, fire stop doors or elevators. These structures exhibit repeatable motion and environment patterns in mobile sensors that can be recognized by supervised learning. In our MISSILE system, the location labels of training data are automatically attained by Bluetooth beacons deployed in sensitive locations. With effective feature extraction procedure robust modeling, MISSILE shows good success rate for inference attack. For example, in a university campus with 15 sensitive locations, MISSILE achieves up to 73% correct prediction score whereas a random guess can only achieve 1/(15 + 1) = 6.25%. Further improvements on system performance and countermeasures are also discussed.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the largest technological evolutions of computing, by 2022 it is estimated that a trillion IP addresses (objects) will be connected to the Internet. The obscurity and low accessibility of many of these devices in this vast heterogeneous network will make it difficult to holistically monitor information flow. Nonetheless, to safeguard networks, unauthorized intruders must be detected within the constraints of each type of device or subnetwork before any system information can be disseminated. In this paper, a survey of the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using the most recent ideas and methods proposed for the IoT is presented. To understand and illustrate IDS platform differences and the current research trend towards a universal, cross-platform distributed approach, the survey starts with an historical examination of intrusion detection systems. This examination of the foundations of IDS research based on the components that make up the IoT is followed by a look at the current holistic trend and an analysis of these schemes. Finally, guidelines to potential IDS in the IoT are proposed before identifying the open research problems.},

abstract={Existing defenses against adversarial attacks are typically tailored to a specific perturbation type. Using adversarial training to defend against multiple types of perturbation requires expensive adversarial examples from different perturbation types at each training step. In contrast, manifold-based defense incorporates a generative network to project an input sample onto the clean data manifold. This approach eliminates the need to generate expensive adversarial examples while achieving robustness against multiple perturbation types. However, the success of this approach relies on whether the generative network can capture the complete clean data manifold, which remains an open problem for complex input domain. In this work, we devise an approximate manifold defense mechanism, called RBF-CNN, for image classification. Instead of capturing the complete data manifold, we use an RBF layer to learn the density of small image patches. RBF-CNN also utilizes a reconstruction layer that mitigates any minor adversarial perturbations. Further, incorporating our proposed reconstruction process for training improves the adversarial robustness of our RBF-CNN models. Experiment results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that RBF-CNN offers robustness for multiple perturbations without the need for expensive adversarial training.},

abstract={Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are commonly leveraged by malware to create lists of domain names, which can be used for command and control (C&C) purposes. Approaches based on machine learning have recently been developed to automatically detect generated domain names in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel DGA called CharBot, which is capable of producing large numbers of unregistered domain names that are not detected by state-of-the-art classifiers for real-time detection of the DGAs, including the recently published methods FANCI (a random forest based on human-engineered features) and LSTM.MI (a deep learning approach). The CharBot is very simple, effective, and requires no knowledge of the targeted DGA classifiers. We show that retraining the classifiers on CharBot samples is not a viable defense strategy. We believe these findings show that DGA classifiers are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks if they rely only on the domain name string to make a decision. Designing a robust DGA classifier may, therefore, necessitate the use of additional information besides the domain name alone. To the best of our knowledge, the CharBot is the simplest and most efficient black-box adversarial attack against DGA classifiers proposed to date.},

abstract={Bad data injection is one of most dangerous attacks in smart grid, as it might lead to energy theft on the end users and device breakdown on the power generation. The attackers can construct the bad data evading the bad data detection mechanisms in power system. In this paper, a novel method, named as Adaptive Partitioning State Estimation (APSE), is proposed to detect bad data injection attack. The basic ideas are: 1) the large system is divided into several subsystems to improve the sensitivity of bad data detection; 2) the detection results are applied to guide the subsystem updating and re-partitioning to locate the bad data. Two attack cases are constructed to inject bad data into an IEEE 39-bus system, evading the traditional bad data detection mechanism. The experiments demonstrate that all bad data can be detected and located within a small area using APSE.},

Then, according to the weaknesses identified in the medical system, a classification of cyber-attacks is presented. Additionally, the paper presents research on previous work that focuses on solving these cyber-attacks and identifies the strengths and limitations of the solutions for each attack. More importantly, for data storage assurance, our paper discusses several cybersecurity architectures for the medical domain from the existing literature. The countermeasures from previous papers and architectures that are still weak in terms of resource depletion, attack reduction, applicability, etc. are addressed. Finally, the paper discusses and recommends solutions for future work to decrease cyber-attacks in the medical field so that human health can be guaranteed.},

abstract={A data representation for system behavior telemetry for scalable big data security analytics is presented, affording telemetry consumers comprehensive visibility into workloads at reduced storage and processing overheads. The new abstraction, SysFlow, is a compact open data format that lifts the representation of system activities into a flow-centric, object-relational mapping that records how applications interact with their environment, relating processes to file accesses, network activities, and runtime information. The telemetry format supports single-event and volumetric flow representations of process control flows, file interactions, and network communications. Evaluation on enterprise-grade benchmarks shows that SysFlow facilitates deeper introspection into attack kill chains while yielding traces orders of magnitude smaller than current state-of-the-art system telemetry approaches-drastically reducing storage requirements and enabling feature-filled system analytics, process-level provenance tracking, and long-term data archival for cyber threat discovery and forensic analysis on historical data.},

abstract={Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are currently the predominant technique commonly used to learn visual features from images. However, the complex structure of most recent DCNNs impose two major requirements namely, huge labeled dataset and high computational resources. In this paper, we develop a new efficient deep unsupervised network to learn invariant image representation from unlabeled visual data. The proposed Deep Convolutional Self-organizing Maps (DCSOM) network comprises a cascade of convolutional SOM layers trained sequentially to represent multiple levels of features. The 2D SOM grid is commonly used for either data visualization or feature extraction. However, this work employs high dimensional map size to create a new deep network. The N-Dimensional SOM (ND-SOM) grid is trained to extract abstract visual features using its classical competitive learning algorithm. The topological order of the features learned from ND-SOM helps to absorb local transformation and deformation variations exhibited in the visual data. The input image is divided into an overlapped local patches where each local patch is represented by the N-coordinates of the winner neuron in the ND-SOM grid. Each dimension of the ND-SOM can be considered as a non-linear principal component and hence it can be exploited to represent the input image using N-Feature Index Image (FII) bank. Multiple convolutional SOM layers can be cascaded to create a deep network structure. The output layer of the DCSOM network computes local histograms of each FII bank in the final convolutional SOM layer. A set of experiments using MNIST handwritten digit database and all its variants are conducted to evaluate the robust representation of the proposed DCSOM network. Experimental results reveal that the performance of DCSOM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for noisy digits and achieve a comparable performance with other complex deep learning architecture for other image variations.},

abstract={Dynamic web applications play a vital role in providing resources manipulation and interaction between clients and servers. The features presently supported by browsers have raised business opportunities, by supplying high interactivity in web-based services, like web banking, e-commerce, social networking, forums, and at the same time, these features have brought serious risks and increased vulnerabilities in web applications that enable cyber-attacks to be executed. One of the common high-risk cyber-attack of web application vulnerabilities is cross-site scripting (XSS). Nowadays, XSS is still dramatically increasing and considered as one of the most severe threats for organizations, users, and developers. If the ploy is successful, the victim is at the mercy of the cybercriminals. In this research, a robust artificial neural network-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) scheme integrated with the dynamic feature extractor is proposed for XSS attack detection. The detection scheme adopts a large real-world dataset, the dynamic features extraction mechanism, and MLP model, which successfully surpassed several tests on an employed unique dataset under careful experimentation, and achieved promising and state-of-the-art results with accuracy, detection probabilities, false positive rate, and AUC-ROC scores of 99.32%, 98.35 %, 0.3%, and 99.02%, respectively. Therefore, it has the potentials to be applied for XSS-based attack detection in either the client-side or the server-side.},

abstract={In recent years, cyber-attacks against individuals, businesses, and organizations have increased. Cyber criminals are always looking for effective vectors to deliver malware to victims in order to launch an attack. Images are used on a daily basis by millions of people around the world, and most users consider images to be safe for use; however, some types of images can contain a malicious payload and perform harmful actions. JPEG is the most popular image format, primarily due to its lossy compression. It is used by almost everyone, from individuals to large organizations, and can be found on almost every device (on digital cameras and smartphones, websites, social media, etc.). Because of their harmless reputation, massive use, and high potential for misuse, JPEG images are used by cyber criminals as an attack vector. While machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting known and unknown malware in various domains, to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods have not been used particularly for the detection of malicious JPEG images. In this paper, we present MalJPEG, the first machine learning-based solution tailored specifically at the efficient detection of unknown malicious JPEG images. MalJPEG statically extracts 10 simple yet discriminative features from the JPEG file structure and leverages them with a machine learning classifier, in order to discriminate between benign and malicious JPEG images. We evaluated MalJPEG extensively on a real-world representative collection of 156,818 images which contains 155,013 (98.85%) benign and 1,805 (1.15%) malicious images. The results show that MalJPEG, when used with the LightGBM classifier, demonstrates the highest detection capabilities, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.997, true positive rate (TPR) of 0.951, and a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.004.},

abstract={The Human-as-a-Sensor (HaaS) paradigm, where it is human users rather than automated sensor systems that detect and report events or incidents has gained considerable traction over the last decades, especially as Internet-connected smartphones have helped develop an information sharing culture in society. In the law enforcement and civil protection space, HaaS is typically used to harvest information that enhances situational awareness regarding physical hazards, crimes and evolving emergencies. The trustworthiness of this information is typically studied in relation to the trustworthiness of the human sensors. However, malicious modification, prevention or delay of reports can also be the result of cyber or cyber-physical security breaches affecting the mobile devices and network infrastructure used to deliver HaaS reports. Examples of these can be denial of service attacks, where the timely delivery of reports is important, and location spoofing attacks, where the accuracy of the location of an incident is important. The aim of this paper is to introduce this cyber-trustworthiness aspect in HaaS and propose a mechanism for scoring reports in terms of their cyber-trustworthiness based on features of the mobile device that are monitored in real-time. Our initial results show that this is a promising line of work that can enhance the reliability of HaaS.},

However, the existing collaborative DNS security schemes have the defects of low credibility and imperfect incentive mechanism. Enlightened by the Consortium blockchain technology, we propose a novel DNS Cache Resources Trusted Sharing Model, which can improve the credibility of DNS resolution results by establishing a complete chain of trust. Firstly, the consortium blockchain is introduced as the carrier of the peer-to-peer network to reduce the impact of illegal access and complicity tampering on the DNS cache credibility; Secondly, the evaluation index of the node credibility in the DNS cache sharing model is proposed, and the trust-based incentive mechanism is designed to reduce the impact of free-riding behavior and on the trusted performance of the system. The two indicators of node abnormal behavior similarity and roundtrip time between nodes are used to comprehensively evaluate the degree of recommendation of the node and serve as the basis for dynamic scheduling; Finally, we use the stochastic distributed decentralized storage mechanism to solve the problem of low efficiency in the consortium blockchain. The simulation results show that the model has certain advantages in ensuring the credibility of domain name resolution results, and maintains the ideal efficiency while ensuring trust.},

Therefore we propose to design robust Android malware detection models against adversarial attacks using reinforcement learning. We propose the Single Policy and Multi Policy based Evasion Attacks for Perfect Knowledge and Limited Knowledge scenario respectively against many malware detection models built using four different sets of classifiers (bagging, boosting and deep neural network). The motivation is to identify the adversarial vulnerability in Android malware detection models and then propose defence against them.},

abstract={The rise of mobile devices has contributed new biometric modalities which reflect behavioral tendencies as users interact with the device's services. In this paper, we explore replay attacks against such systems and how a remote attack might affect authentication performance. There are few efforts that focus on replay attacks in mobile biometric systems, and none to our knowledge related to user-device interactions, such as the use of mobile apps. Instead, previous efforts have mainly considered spoofing attacks, which implicate that the attacker has learned their target's behavior instead of obtaining a direct copy of logged behavior by theft. Here, we explore temporally-derived replay attacks that assume that application, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi data has been captured remotely and then intelligently combined with some level of noise to avoid the replay of an exact copy of legitimate data. We study several factors that may affect replay attack detection, including the effects of varying the amount of data available during data collection, the number of samples used for training, and supervised and unsupervised learning on attack detection. In our analysis, false positive rates increased from 2.3% when using zero-effort attacks to over 40% as a result of replay attacks. However, our results also show that by contextualizing behavior in the feature representation, false positive rates decrease by over 25%.},

year={2011},

pages={124-129},
abstract={In this paper, a fast and robust feature based scan matching algorithm for LiDAR systems, especially dedicated to outdoor SLAM applications, is introduced. There are large numbers of variants of scan matching algorithms, and they are mostly based on matching of the whole or randomly sampled points. However, this study shows that the sampling strategy is extremely important for a fast and reliable scan matching. In this study, we give point to four different sampling strategies for scan matching. The first one is the regular sampling which is mostly preferred due to its simplicity, and the second one is the normal random sampling. The third strategy is the grid or voxel based sampling, where the point cloud is divided into fixed cells then the equal numbers of points are sampled from each cells. In this way, it is obtained a more uniform sampling method than the others. The last special form of sampling strategy that we propose is based on the feature extraction. The plane segments are extracted from the input scan, and then the matching is performed based on these plane points. The results show that it is possible to obtain a fast and robust scan matching algorithm by using almost %3 percent of the data in matching. Although the introduced sampling methods are independent of the scan matching algorithm, the Multi-Layered Normal Distribution Transform is used for this purpose. In summary, the proposed method has several advantages over conventional methods; the first advantage is that the method becomes more robust to outliers since the matching is based on planar structures. The second advantage is that the algorithm becomes much faster since the number of points matched is very less with respect to all points. Therefore, the feature extraction can be considered as a special sampling strategy. For performance analysis, the real datasets are used and the proposed sampling methods are compared with each other. The results are very attractive for 3D scan matching in SLAM.},

abstract={CAPTCHA challenges are used all over the Internet to prevent automated scripts from spamming web services. However, recent technological developments have rendered the conventional CAPTCHA insecure and inconvenient to use. In this paper, we propose vCAPTCHA, a voice-based CAPTCHA system that would: (1) enable more secure human authentication, (2) more conveniently integrate with modern devices accessing web services, and (3) help collect vast amounts of annotated speech data for different languages, accents, and dialects that are under-represented in the current speech corpora, thus making speech technologies accessible to more people around the world. vCAPTCHA requires users to speak their responses, in order to unlock or use different web services, instead of typing them. These user responses are analyzed to determine if they were indeed naturally produced, and transcribed to ensure that they contain the challenge sentence. We build a prototype for vCAPTCHA in order to assess its performance and practicality. Our preliminary results show that we are able to achieve an attack success rate as low as 2.3% while maintaining a human success rate comparable to current CAPTCHAs, on ASVspoof datasets.},

abstract={As computing becomes mobile and systems enable connectivity through mobile applications, the characteristics of the network communication of these systems change due to the instability of mobile nodes on networks. Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is transforming the world into Smart Cities, which have a huge impact on future societal lifestyle, economy and business. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially IoT-enabled Electric Vehicles (EVs), are anticipated to be an integral part of future Smart Cities. Assuring ITS safety and security is critical to the success of Smart Cities because human lives are at stake. The state-of-the-art understanding of this matter is very superficial because there are many new problems that have yet to be investigated. For example, the cyber-physical nature of ITS requires considering human-in-the-loop (i.e., drivers and pedestrians) and imposes many new challenges. In this paper, we systematically explore the threat model against ITS safety and security (e.g., malfunctions of connected EVs/transportation infrastructures, driver misbehavior and unexpected medical conditions, and cyber attacks). Then, we present a novel and systematic ITS safety and security architecture, which aims to reduce accidents caused or amplified by a range of threats. The architecture has appealing features: (i) it is centered at proactive cyber-physical-human defense; (ii) it facilitates the detection of early-warning signals of accidents; (iii) it automates effective defense against a range of threats.},

abstract={Android applications are developing rapidly across the mobile ecosystem, but Android malware is also emerging in an endless stream. Many researchers have studied the problem of Android malware detection and have put forward theories and methods from different perspectives. Existing research suggests that machine learning is an effective and promising way to detect Android malware. Notwithstanding, there exist reviews that have surveyed different issues related to Android malware detection based on machine learning. We believe our work complements the previous reviews by surveying a wider range of aspects of the topic. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Android malware detection approaches based on machine learning. We briefly introduce some background on Android applications, including the Android system architecture, security mechanisms, and classification of Android malware. Then, taking machine learning as the focus, we analyze and summarize the research status from key perspectives such as sample acquisition, data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning models, algorithms, and the evaluation of detection effectiveness. Finally, we assess the future prospects for research into Android malware detection based on machine learning. This review will help academics gain a full picture of Android malware detection based on machine learning. It could then serve as a basis for subsequent researchers to start new work and help to guide research in the field more generally.},

abstract={With the proliferation of mobile devices and various sensors (e.g., GPS, magnetometer, accelerometers, gyroscopes) equipped, richer services, e.g. location based services, are provided to users. A series of methods have been proposed to protect the users' privacy, especially the trajectory privacy. Hardware fingerprinting has been demonstrated to be a surprising and effective source for identifying/authenticating devices. In this work, we show that a few data samples collected from the motion sensors are enough to uniquely identify the source mobile device, i.e., the raw motion sensor data serves as a fingerprint of the mobile device. Specifically, we first analytically understand the fingerprinting capacity using features extracted from hardware data. To capture the essential device feature automatically, we design a multi-LSTM neural network to fingerprint mobile device sensor in real-life uses, instead of using handcrafted features by existing work. Using data collected over 6 months, for arbitrary user movements, our fingerprinting model achieves 93% F-score given one second data, while the state-of-the-art work achieves 79% F-score. Given ten seconds randomly sampled data, our model can achieve 98.8% accuracy. We also propose a novel generative model to modify the original sensor data and yield anonymized data with little fingerprint information while retain good data utility.},

abstract={Organizations are experiencing an ever-growing concern of how to identify and defend against insider threats. Existing methods have distinguished the minority of users who show suspicious behavior from the majority of users. However, these methods failed to apply the features reflecting the deviation between the behaviors of users and those of their user groups within the similar job roles. This paper focuses on insider threat detection by conducting both user and role behaviors analysis. It extracts multiple features that represent the details of activities conducted by each user and their deviations from the behaviors of their user groups. The malicious users are then detected by using an unsupervised algorithm, Isolation Forest Algorithm, which evaluates the variance that each user exhibits across multiple attributes, compared against the other users. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models comprehensively, we implement a series of experiments with the data lasting 17 months. We compare the proposed method with an existing state-of-the-art method and the results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed detection method.},

abstract={Federated learning (FL) is a newly emerging distributed learning framework that is communication-efficient with user privacy guarantee. Wireless end-user devices can collaboratively train a global model while keeping their local training data private. Nevertheless, recent studies show that FL is highly susceptible to attacks from malicious users since the server cannot directly access and audit the user's local training data. In this work, we identify a new kind of attack surface that is much easier to be carried out while remaining a high attack success rate. By exploiting the inherent flaw of the weight assignment strategy in the standard federated learning process, our attack can bypass the existing defense methods and damage the performance of the global model effectively. We then propose a new density-based detection strategy to defend against such attack by modeling the problem as anomaly detection to effectively detect anomalous updates. Experimental results on two typical datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, show that our attack can significantly affect the convergence of the aggregated model and reduce the accuracy of the global model. This holds true even the state-of-the-art defense strategies are deployed, while our newly proposed defense can effectively mitigate such attack.},

abstract={Entity alignment is a crucial tool in knowledge discovery to reconcile knowledge from different sources. Recent state-of-the-art approaches leverage joint embedding of knowledge graphs (KGs) so that similar entities from different KGs are close in the embedded space. Whatever the joint embedding technique used, a seed set of aligned entities, often provided by (time-consuming) human expertise, is required to learn the joint KG embedding and/or a mapping between KG embeddings. In this context, a key issue is to limit the size and quality requirement for the seed. State-of-the-art methods usually learn the embedding by explicitly minimizing the distance between aligned entities from the seed and uniformly maximizing the distance for entities not in the seed. In contrast, we design a less restrictive optimization criterion that indirectly minimizes the distance between aligned entities in the seed by globally maximizing the dimension-wise correlation among all the embeddings of seed entities. Within an iterative entity alignment system, the correlation-based entity embedding function achieves state-of-the-art results and is shown to significantly increase robustness to the seed's size and accuracy. It ultimately enables fully unsupervised entity alignment using a seed automatically generated with a symbolic alignment method based on entities' names.},

abstract={Suffered from the contradiction between the limited capacity of local devices and large size of DNN models, a practical solution is transferring the heavy computational tasks from the local to the server side such as cloud. However, the untrusted server naturally requires all the user data to train neural networks and infer results, which causes the asset loss of the local and raises serious privacy concerns on user's sensitive information. To solve this problem in scenarios of machine learning as a service, we propose a general framework to balance the user privacy, model accuracy and training efficiency, simultaneously. Specifically, our representative subset selection algorithm takes the training value of data into account, selecting the most representative subset from the training data, in order to mitigate the loss of data assets, lower down the transmission overhead from the local to the server and lessen the training burden on the server at the same time. We also design a noisy representation transformation algorithm applying on the features extracted by neural networks to further perturb the data within the selected representative subset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can run locally with little sacrifice on the computation resource. It can not only protect private data before uploading, but also promote the training efficiency of servers.},

abstract={Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) have brought significant performance improvements to face recognition. However the training can hardly be carried out on mobile devices because the training of these models requires much computational power. An individual user with the demand of deriving DNN models from her own datasets usually has to outsource the training procedure onto an edge server. However this outsourcing method violates privacy because it exposes the users' data to curious service providers. In this paper, we utilize the differentially private mechanism to enable the privacy-preserving edge based training of DNN face recognition models. During the training, DNN is split between the user device and the edge server in a way that both private data and model parameters are protected, with only a small cost of local computations. We rigorously prove that our approach is privacy preserving. We finally show that our mechanism is capable of training models in different scenarios, e.g., from scratch, or through fine-tuning over existed models.},

abstract={The employment of modern machine learning algorithms marks a huge advance towards automated and generalized segmentation in medical image analysis. Entire radiological datasets are classified, leading to a meaningful morphological interpretation, clearly distinguishing pathologies. After standard pre-processing, e.g. smoothing the input image data, the entire volume is partitioned into a large number of sub-regions utilizing watershed transform. These fragments are atomic and fused together building contiguous structures representing organs and typical morphology. This fusion is driven by similarity of regions. The relevant similarity measures respond to statistical a-priori models, derived from training datasets. In this work, the applicability of evolution strategy as classifier for a generic image segmentation approach is evaluated. Furthermore, it is analyzed if accuracy and robustness of the segmentation are improved by incorporation of meta features evaluated on the entire classification solution besides local features evaluated for the pre-fragmented regions to classify. The proposed generic strategy has a high potential in new segmentation domains, relying only on a small set of reference segmentations, as evaluated for different imaging modalities and diagnostic domains, such as brain MRI or abdominal CT. Comparison with results from other machine learning approaches, e.g. neural networks or genetic programming, proves that the newly developed evolution strategy is highly applicable for this classification domain and can best incorporate meta features for evaluation of solution fitness.},

abstract={Testing is one of the major problems in Linux kernel development cycle. Security analysis and ensuring no new vulnerabilities has been introduced is one of the toughest issues of testing. Kernel developers attempt to find as many security issues as possible before merging with the mainline branch. Failure to detect vulnerabilities will result in vulnerable kernel shipped by distribution and vulnerable systems. The kernel developers can choose between several industrial and open source tools to assist in the development process and shorten the development cycle. (Though not as many as user space developers. Kernel tools are limited and rare compared to user space tools) Some of these tools are used to test the reliability of the kernel and detect kernel vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these tools are not sufficient! LgDb was introduced in [1], [2] in our previous work. LgDb is a proof-of-concept tool that was presented as an innovative framework for kernel profiling, code coverage and simulations. LgDb runs the inspected kernel on a para virtual environment based on Lguest. Most existing tools limitations stem from the nature of the task. A user space tool cannot inspect the kernel on which it runs on. By using virtualization LgDb eliminates most of the existing tools limitations. As far as the host is concerned LgDb runs as a user process and the need for complex kernel space tools is alleviated. In this work we will present an extension to LgDb in order to detect kernel security vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities detection process is not automatic. However, LgDb allows the developer test the code during the development, similarly to a debugger. The vulnerabilities types that LgDb addresses are proved to be lacking efficient automatic detection tools and manifested in several kernel vulnerabilities.},

Thereafter, new liveness detection is proposed to determine the perceptually invisible boundary between the fake and original iris textures. Response of Gaussian derivative filters with multiple scales and orientations at each pixel location is clustered using K-means to ascertain regions with different textures. To give robustness to the algorithm, it is iterated a certain number of times and a threshold mechanism is imposed to find the correct boundary. The proposed method is shown to achieve high liveness performance by generating a set of 600 fake iris images from the UPOL iris database.},

abstract={Adversarial examples have recently proven to be able to fool deep learning methods by adding carefully crafted small perturbation to the input space image. In this paper, we study the possibility of generating adversarial examples for code-based iris recognition systems. Since generating adversarial examples requires back-propagation of the adversarial loss, conventional filter bank-based iris-code generation frameworks cannot be employed in such a setup. Therefore, to compensate for this shortcoming, we propose to train a deep auto-encoder surrogate network to mimic the conventional iris code generation procedure. This trained surrogate network is then deployed to generate the adversarial examples using the iterative gradient sign method algorithm [15]. We consider non-targeted and targeted attacks through three attack scenarios. Considering these attacks, we study the possibility of fooling an iris recognition system in white-box and black-box frameworks.},

abstract={The modernization of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), primarily targeting increased efficiency and controllability through integration of Information Technologies (IT), introduced the unwanted side effect of extending the ICS cyber-security threat landscape. ICS are facing new security challenges and are exposed to the same vulnerabilities that plague IT, as demonstrated by the increasing number of incidents targeting ICS. Due to the criticality and unique nature of these systems, it is important to devise novel defense mechanisms that incorporate knowledge of the underlying physical model, and can detect attacks in early phases. To this end, we study a benchmark chemical process, and enumerate the various categories of attack vectors and their practical applicability on hardware controllers in a Hardware-In-The-Loop testbed. Leveraging the observed implications of the categorized attacks on the process, as well as the profile of typical disturbances, we follow a data-driven approach to detect anomalies that are early indicators of malicious activity.},

abstract={Careful consideration of grid developments illustrates the fundamental changes in its structure which its developments have taken place gradually for a long time. One of the most important developments is the expansion of the communication infrastructure that brings many advantages in the cyber layer of the system. The actual execution of the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is one core advantage which also may lead to the systematic risks such as cyber-attacks. Consequently, it is necessary to form a useful way to cover such challenges. This paper focuses on the online detection of false data injection attack (FDIA), which tries to disrupt the trend of optimal peer-to-peer energy trading in the stochastic condition. Moreover, this article proposes an effective modified Intelligent Priority Selection based Reinforcement Learning (IPS-RL) method to detect and stop the malicious attacks in the shortest time for effective energy trading based on the peer to peer structure. The presented method is compared with other methods such as support vector machine (SVM), reinforcement learning (RL), particle swarm optimization (PSO)-RL, and genetic algorithm (GA)-RL to validate the functionality of the method. The proposed method is implemented and examined on three interconnected microgrids in the form of peer-to-peer structure wherein each microgrid has various agents such as photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, fuel cell, tidal system, storage unit, etc. Eventually, the unscented transformation (UT) is applied for uncertainty analysis and making the near-reality simulations.},

However, it has been found that deep learning models are vulnerable to data instances that can mislead the model to make incorrect classification decisions socalled adversarial examples. Such vulnerability allows attackers to target NIDSs in a black-box setting by adding small crafty perturbations to the malicious traffic to evade detection and disrupt the system's critical functionalities. Yet, little researches have addressed the risks of black-box adversarial attacks against NIDS and proposed mitigation solutions. This survey explores this research problem and identifies open issues and certain areas that demand further research for considerable impacts.},

abstract={Most organizations deploy Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network activities for signs of security violations and these systems generate alerts whenever a known intrusion signature is detected in the network traffic. However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.},

abstract={The popularity of Internet applications has made communication privacy an increasingly important security requirement. As an important aspect of privacy, anonymity ensures that a subject may use resources or services without disclosing user identity or corresponding relationships. Since the seminal work by Chaum for anonymous communication, many different anonymous communication systems, and anonymous protocols have been developed and investigated extensively. In recent years, anonymous communication systems have evolved from academic tools used by specialists to mass-market software used by millions of ordinary people. How to evaluate and quantify the anonymity that different anonymous communication systems can offer has been a new focus. Though some efforts have been made on anonymity metrics and measuring techniques, systematic research on measuring anonymity of anonymous communication systems is still needed. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research on measuring anonymity. We first summarize the anonymous mechanisms applied by different anonymous systems. We then introduce the formalization of the notion of anonymity for measuring the anonymity degree. Further, metrics based on various theories and approaches are reviewed. We particularly elaborate on the metrics based on information theory as a separate section because of its popularity and multiple branches. The metrics based on information entropy is probably of the greatest interest.},

abstract={Adversarial example (AE), an input that is modified slightly to cause a machine learning system to produce erroneous outputs, has seen significant studies recently. Unfortunately, the fine data perturbation of AE ignores to keep potential data correlations between feature pairs. Thus, such AE will be easily filtered by configuring data correlations as basic filtering rules. In this paper, avoiding not to be filtered as well as causing false classification, an advanced robust AE generation attack is proposed. We first define four basic data correlations called strict linear constraint, approximate linear constraint, addition boundary constraint and zero multiplication constraint. Then, based on embedding multiple data correlations into one constraint matrix from the Pearson analysis, our approach can enable a Hadamard product of the constraint matrix and the sign of gradient matrix to craft perturbations, keeping consistent data correlations. Experimental results on intrusion detection system (IDS) indicate: 1) Nearly all AEs from original IFGSM are invalid by filtering according to basic data correlations; 2) In our method, AEs against a targeted DNN-based classifier can achieve an attack success rate of 99%, with transfer attack ability of 94% average success rate to attack other different mainstream classifiers.},

abstract={False data injection (FDI) attack causes a disadvantage to the safety of a power system. In the past, the adversary launching FDI attack mostly needed the complete network topology information of the power system and a large amount of measurements. However, the reality is that the adversary has limited resources and can hardly manipulate massive measurements without being detected. This paper proposes a new method to form attack vector in the condition of incomplete system information. The proposed method first maps the restricted data into a new Jacobian matrix by a kernel-independent component analysis, then constructs the undetectable attack model, and finally, designs a less costly attack vector to accomplish the FDI attack. The experimental results on different IEEE buses with Matpower tool illustrate the validity of the proposed method. Additionally, the proposed method shows a relatively high success rate in the cases of different degrees of incomplete information and various quantities of manipulated data in different power systems.},

abstract={Network-based signature generation (NSG) has been proposed as a way to automatically and quickly generate accurate signatures for worms, especially polymorphic worms. In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined "more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.},

abstract={Industry 5.0 is the digitalization, automation, and data exchange of industrial processes that involve artificial intelligence, industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and industrial cyber-physical systems (I-CPS). In healthcare, I-CPS enables the intelligent wearable devices to gather data from the real-world and transmit to the virtual world for decision-making. I-CPS makes our lives comfortable with the emergence of innovative healthcare applications. Similar to any other IIoT paradigm, I-CPS capable healthcare applications face numerous challenging issues. The resource-constrained nature of wearable devices and their inability to support complex security mechanisms provide an ideal platform to malevolent entities for launching attacks. To preserve the privacy of wearable devices and their data in an I-CPS environment, in this article we propose a lightweight mutual authentication scheme. Our scheme is based on client-server interaction model that uses symmetric encryption for establishing secured sessions among the communicating entities. After mutual authentication, the privacy risk associated with a patient data is predicted using an AI-enabled hidden Markov model. We analyzed the robustness and security of our scheme using Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic. This analysis shows that the use of lightweight security primitives for the exchange of session keys makes the proposed scheme highly resilient in terms of security, efficiency, and robustness. Finally, the proposed scheme incurs nominal overhead in terms of processing, communication and storage and is capable to combat a wide range of adversarial threats.},

abstract={Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) methods and switched antenna arrays (SAAs) are very attractive for application in automotive radar because of their low hardware complexity. In traditional SAA radar, the receiving antenna array elements are successively switched according to their natural spatial order [referred to as sequential SAAs (SSAAs)]. For radars using both SSAA and FMCW methods, the phase difference caused by the target azimuth and time delay will be difficult to distinguish, thus resulting in delay-space coupling, which may lead to degradation of the road target observation. In this paper, randomized SAA (RSAA) FMCW radar is proposed. The new radar scheme has high delay/space resolution for target location detection and character extraction, and can also solve the coupling problem. The signal model of RSAA FMCW radar is derived and compared with that of SSAA radar. The influence of the antenna-array switching mode on the radar performance is also analyzed. A conventional zero-padding algorithm and a new clustering FOCUSS algorithm are both introduced for the signal processing of the new radar scheme. The numerical results illustrate the performance of RSAA FMCW radar in high-resolution target imaging and delay-space decoupling.},

abstract={The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have achieved tremendous breakthroughs in many end-to-end applications, such as image identification, text classification, and speech recognition. By replicating these successes to the field of malware detection, several CNN-based malware detectors have achieved encouraging performance without significant feature engineering effort in recent years. Unfortunately, by analyzing their robustness using gradient-based algorithms, several studies have shown that some of these malware detectors are vulnerable to the evasion attacks (also known as adversarial examples). However, the existing attack methods can only achieve quite low attack success rates. In this paper, we propose two novel white-box methods and one novel black-box method to attack a recently proposed malware detector. By incorporating the gradient-based algorithm, one of our white-box methods can achieve a success rate of over 99%. Without prior knowledge of the exact structure and internal parameters of the detector, the proposed black-box method can also achieve a success rate of over 70%. In addition, we consider adversarial training as a defensive mechanism in order to resist evasion attacks. While proving the effectiveness of adversarial training, we also analyze its security risk, that is, a large number of adversarial examples can poison the training dataset of the detector. Therefore, we propose a pre-detection mechanism to reject adversarial examples. The experiments show that this mechanism can effectively improve the safety and efficiency of malware detection.},

abstract={Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) provides a unique platform for vehicles to intelligently exchange critical information, such as collision avoidance messages. It is, therefore, paramount that this information remains reliable and authentic, i.e., originated from a legitimate and trusted vehicle. Trust establishment among vehicles can ensure security of a VANET by identifying dishonest vehicles and revoking messages with malicious content. For this purpose, several trust models (TMs) have been proposed but, currently, there is no effective way to compare how they would behave in practice under adversary conditions. To this end, we propose a novel trust evaluation and management (TEAM) framework, which serves as a unique paradigm for the design, management, and evaluation of TMs in various contexts and in presence of malicious vehicles. Our framework incorporates an asset-based threat model and ISO-based risk assessment for the identification of attacks against critical risks. The TEAM has been built using VEINS, an open source simulation environment which incorporates SUMO traffic simulator and OMNET++ discrete event simulator. The framework created has been tested with the implementation of three types of TMs (data oriented, entity oriented, and hybrid) under four different contexts of VANET based on the mobility of both honest and malicious vehicles. Results indicate that the TEAM is effective to simulate a wide range of TMs, where the efficiency is evaluated against different quality of service and security-related criteria. Such framework may be instrumental for planning smart cities and for car manufacturers.},

Automating FACS coding would make this research faster and more widely applicable, opening up new avenues to understanding how we communicate through facial expressions. Such an automated process can also potentially increase the reliability, precision and temporal resolution of coding. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of research into machine analysis of facial actions. We systematically review all components of such systems: pre-processing, feature extraction and machine coding of facial actions. In addition, the existing FACS-coded facial expression databases are summarised. Finally, challenges that have to be addressed to make automatic facial action analysis applicable in real-life situations are extensively discussed. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the future of machine recognition of facial actions: what are the challenges and opportunities that researchers in the field face.},

abstract={Recent studies have demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial input perturbations: meticulously engineered slight perturbations can result in inappropriate categorization of valid images. Adversarial Training has been one of the successful defense approaches in recent times. In this work, we propose an alternative to adversarial training by training a separate model with adversarial examples instead of the original classifier. We train an adversarial detector network known as 'Defense-Net' with strong adversary while training the original classifier with only clean training data. We propose a new adversarial cross entropy loss function to train Defense-Net appropriately differentiate between different adversarial examples. Defense-Net solves three major concerns regarding the development of a successful adversarial defense method. First, our defense does not have clean data accuracy degradation in contrast to traditional adversarial training based defenses. Second, we demonstrate this resiliency with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets, and show that the state-of-the-art accuracy under the most powerful known white-box attack was increased from 94.02 % to 99.2 % on MNIST, and 47 % to 94.79 % on CIFAR-10. Finally, unlike most recent defenses, our approach does not suffer from obfuscated gradient and can successfully defend strong BPDA, PGD, FGSM and C & W attacks.},

abstract={As the market for autonomous vehicles advances, a need for robust safety protocols also increases. Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to understand their operating environment. Active sensors such as camera, LiDAR, ultrasonic, and radar are vulnerable to physical channel attacks. One way to counter these attacks is to pattern match the sensor data with its own unique physical distortions, commonly referred to as a fingerprint. This fingerprint exists because of how the sensor was manufactured, and it can be used to determine the transmitting sensor from the received waveform. In this paper, using an ultrasonic sensor, we establish that there exists a specific distortion profile in the transmitted waveform called physical fingerprint that can be attributed to their intrinsic characteristics. We propose a joint time-frequency analysis-based framework for ultrasonic sensor fingerprint extraction and use it as a feature to train a Naive Bayes classifier. The trained model is used for transmitter identification from the received physical waveform.},

abstract={Human motion prediction is a challenging and important task in many computer vision application domains. Existing work only implicitly models the spatial structure of the human skeleton. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the prediction into individual joints by means of a structured prediction layer that explicitly models the joint dependencies. This is implemented via a hierarchy of small-sized neural networks connected analogously to the kinematic chains in the human body as well as a joint-wise decomposition in the loss function. The proposed layer is agnostic to the underlying network and can be used with existing architectures for motion modelling. Prior work typically leverages the H3.6M dataset. We show that some state-of-the-art techniques do not perform well when trained and tested on AMASS, a recently released dataset 14 times the size of H3.6M. Our experiments indicate that the proposed layer increases the performance of motion forecasting irrespective of the base network, joint-angle representation, and prediction horizon. We furthermore show that the layer also improves motion predictions qualitatively. We make code and models publicly available at https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2019/spl.},

abstract={Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are considered as essential mechanisms to ensure reliable security. In an intrusion detection context, none of the main detection approaches (signature-based and anomaly-based) are fully satisfactory. False positives (detected non-attacks) and false negatives (non-detected attacks) are the major limitations of such systems. The generated alerts are elementary and in huge numbers. Hence, alert correlation techniques are used to provide a complementary analysis to link elementary alerts and provide a more global intrusion view. We propose an alert correlation and aggregation framework based on requires/provides model. The objective is to discover the logical relationships between atomic alerts potentially incorporated in multi-stage attacks. The obtained results illustrate that the proposed system can effectively detect coordinated attack with minimum false positives.},

abstract={With the proliferation of smartphones, the security threats have correspondingly increased. Although some form of security mechanisms like authentication and encryption have been provided on platforms such as Android, these alone cannot mitigate all the forms of threats. Thus, the need for an intrusion detection system for smartphones has become immensely important. In this project, we capitalize on earlier approaches of host-based intrusion detection systems and behavior-based intrusion detection systems for Android smartphones to design and implement a host-based, behavior-based passive intrusion detection system, Protego, for Android smartphones. There are two versions - static and dynamic, each with its own novel approach. The static version of Protego improves predictive performance by implementing feature reduction, thus increasing classifier accuracy significantly. The novelty of dynamic approach is that it analyzes live traffic with a minimum delay (in the order of milliseconds). This opens up a variety of use cases for our system, especially in the business world where information security on smartphones is of utmost importance. We have illustrated this by also extending Protego to devise a solution for BYOD (bring your own device), a growing trend in the corporate world, by using the IDS to detect other malicious activities like peer-to-peer traffic from torrent clients.},

abstract={Android packing services provide significant benefits in code protection by hiding original executable code, which help app developers to protect their code against reverse engineering. However, adversaries take the advantage of packers to hide their malicious code. A number of unpacking approaches have been proposed to defend against malicious packed apps. Unfortunately, most of the unpacking approaches work only for a limited time or for a particular type of packers. The analysis for different packers often requires specific domain knowledge and a significant amount of manual effort. In this paper, we conducted analyses of known Android packers appeared in recent years and propose to design an automatic detection and classification framework. The framework is capable of identifying packed apps, extracting the execution behavioral pattern of packers, and categorizing packed apps into groups. The variants of packer families share typical behavioral patterns reflecting their activities and packing techniques. The behavioral patterns obtained dynamically can be exploited to detect and classify unknown packers, which shed light on new directions for security researchers.},

abstract={Protecting and preventing sensitive data from being used inappropriately has become a challenging task. Even a small mistake in securing data can be exploited by phishing attacks to release private information such as passwords or financial information to a malicious actor. Phishing has now proven so successful, it is the number one attack vector. Many approaches have been proposed to protect against this type of cyber-attack, from additional staff training, enriched spam filters to large collaborative databases of known threats such as PhishTank and OpenPhish. However, they mostly rely upon a user falling victim to an attack and manually adding this new threat to the shared pool, which presents a constant disadvantage in the fight back against phishing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protect against phishing attacks using binary visualisation and machine learning. Unlike previous work in this field, our approach uses an automated detection process and requires no further user interaction, which allows faster and more accurate detection process. The experiment results show that our approach has high detection rate.},

Given the prevalence of fraud in the healthcare domain, it is important to consider the adversarial use of DNNs in manipulating sensitive data that is crucial to patient healthcare. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a DNN-based image translation attack on biomedical imagery. More specifically, we propose Jekyll, a neural style transfer framework that takes as input a biomedical image of a patient and translates it to a new image that indicates an attacker-chosen disease condition. The potential for fraudulent claims based on such generated `fake' medical images is significant, and we demonstrate successful attacks on both X-rays and retinal fundus image modalities. We show that these attacks manage to mislead both medical professionals and algorithmic detection schemes. Lastly, we also investigate defensive measures based on machine learning to detect images generated by Jekyll.},

abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) deploys edge devices to act as intermediaries between sensors and actuators and application servers or cloud services. Machine learning models have been widely used to thwart malware attacks in such edge devices. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where attackers craft adversarial samples by introducing small perturbations to malware samples to fool a classifier to misclassify them as benign applications. Literature on deep learning networks proposes adversarial retraining as a defense mechanism where adversarial samples are combined with legitimate samples to retrain the classifier. However, existing works select such adversarial samples in a random fashion which degrades the classifier's performance. This work proposes two novel approaches for selecting adversarial samples to retrain a classifier. One, based on the distance from malware cluster center, and the other, based on a probability measure derived from a kernel-based learning (KBL). Our experiments show that both of our sample selection methods outperform the random selection method and the KBL selection method improves detection accuracy by 6%. Also, while existing works focus on deep neural networks with respect to adversarial retraining, we additionally assess the impact of such adversarial samples on other classifiers and our proposed selective adversarial retraining approaches show similar performance improvement for these classifiers as well. The outcomes from the study can assist in designing robust security systems for IIoT applications.},

abstract={A host of different KG embedding techniques have emerged recently and have been empirically shown to be very effective in accurately predicting missing facts in a KG, thus improving its coverage and quality. Unfortunately, embedding techniques can fall prey to adversarial data poisoning attack. In this form of attack, facts may be added to or deleted from a KG, called performing perturbations, that results in the manipulation of the plausibility of target facts in a KG. While recent works confirm this intuition, the attacks considered there ignore the risk of exposure. Intuitively, an attack is of limited value if it is highly likely to be caught, i.e., exposed. To address this, we introduce a notion of the exposure risk and propose a novel problem of attacking a KG by means of perturbations where the goal is to maximize the manipulation of the target fact’s plausibility while keeping the risk of exposure under a given budget. We design a deep reinforcement learning-based framework, called RATA, that learns to use low-risk perturbations without compromising on the performance, i.e., manipulation of target fact plausibility. We test the performance of RATA against recently proposed strategies for KG attacks, on two different benchmark datasets and on different kinds of target facts. Our experiments show that RATA achieves state-of-the-art performance even while using a fraction of the risk.},

abstract={Previous works have discovered that general DNNs are vulnerable under some subtle and specific perturbations on classification tasks. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) unfolded through sparse coding algorithms have achieved great success in sparse coding problem. Some applications of sparse coding have important strategic significance in many cases, and the security of learned models is vital. However, it has not achieved enough attentions. Our paper is the first work to study the adversarial performance on unfolded DNNs for sparse coding. We first verify the effectiveness of the existing attack or defense strategies, and surprisingly discover the defense strategies are useless. In addition, we propose a special attack strategy to eliminate the element on certain dimension of the sparse output code of DNNs. Furthermore, we propose a succinct black-box attack strategy, which could generate adversarial perturbations without knowing the parameters of DNNs and data.},

In a smart home system, a central gateway is required to coordinate the functions of various smart home devices and allow bidirectional communications. However, the gateway may cause leakage of sensitive information unless proper privacy protections are applied. In this work, we first introduce a smart home model based on fog computing and secured by differential privacy. Then, we apply a personalized differential privacy scheme to provide privacy protection. Furthermore, we consider a collusion attack and propose our differential privacy model called APDP based on a modified Laplace mechanism and a Markov process to strengthen privacy protection, thus resisting the attack. Lastly, we perform extensive experiments based on the real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed APDP model.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are susceptible to various anomalies during their operations. Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.},

abstract={Recently, malware has increasingly become a critical threat to embedded systems, while the conventional software solutions, such as antivirus and patches, have not been so successful in defending the ever-evolving and advanced malicious programs. In this paper, we propose a hardware-enhanced architecture, GuardOL, to perform online malware detection. GuardOL is a combined approach using processor and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Our approach aims to capture the malicious behavior (i.e., high-level semantics) of malware. To this end, we first propose the frequency-centric model for feature construction using system call patterns of known malware and benign samples. We then develop a machine learning approach (using multilayer perceptron) in FPGA to train classifier using these features. At runtime, the trained classifier is used to classify the unknown samples as malware or benign, with early prediction. The experimental results show that our solution can achieve high classification accuracy, fast detection, low power consumption, and flexibility for easy functionality upgrade to adapt to new malware samples. One of the main advantages of our design is the support of early prediction-detecting 46% of malware within first 30% of their execution, while 97% of the samples at 100% of their execution, with <;3% false positives.},

abstract={Prior work has shown that multibiometric systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, assuming that their matching score distribution is identical to that of genuine users, without fabricating any fake trait. We have recently shown that this assumption is not representative of current fingerprint and face presentation attacks, leading one to overestimate the vulnerability of multibiometric systems, and to design less effective fusion rules. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a statistical meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and, potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from those considered during design, through an uncertainty analysis. We empirically show that our approach can reliably predict the performance of multibiometric systems even under never-before-seen face and fingerprint presentation attacks, and that the secure fusion rules designed using our approach can exhibit an improved trade-off between the performance in the absence and in the presence of attack. We finally argue that our method can be extended to other biometrics besides faces and fingerprints.},

In scenarios where denial is potentially hostile, the use of stealth approaches is essential, as it allows such missions to be conducted in the proximity of threatening radars and weapons. We propose a model that allows autonomous UAVs to dynamically and cooperatively reduce their exposure to threats by adopting a stealth policy, in which they turn off their communication radios once a threat is detected. We named this approach of cooperative model as Stealth UAV Networks (SUN). Our model also encompasses control laws for connectivity maintenance, collision avoidance between UAVs, flight path planning, coverage area and robustness to communication failures improvement. We validated the approach with different combinations of control laws, number of UAVs and scenario hostility. The exposure of UAVs to threats decreased by at least 61% and at most 96% when the stealth policy is active, considering all simulation settings. Thus, highlighting that the stealth policy can be successfully used in missions that demand the increase of coverage area rate or robustness to failures.},

abstract={Most state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods are based on turn- and frame-level analysis independent from phonetic transcription. Currently "affective computing" community could not specify the smallest emotional standard unit which can be easily classified and determined by any "advanced" and "non-advanced" listener. It is known that, acoustic modeling on the smallest phonetic unit (phoneme) started a new era in automatic speech recognition: switch from speaker dependent isolated word recognition to speaker independent continuous speech recognition. In or current research we showed that phoneme can be used as as smallest unit for high and low arousal emotion classification task. We trained our classifications models on the VAM dataset material and evaluated them on speech samples from the DES dataset. For our experiments we employed two different emotion classification approaches: general (phonetic pattern independent) and phoneme-based (phonetic pattern dependent). Both classification approaches used MFFC features extracted on the frame level. Our experimental results impressively show that the proposed phoneme-based classification technique could increase emotion classification performance by about 9.68% absolute (15.98% relative). We showed that phoneme-level emotion models trained on "natural" emotions could provide impressive classification performance on dataset with acted affective content.},

abstract={With the advent of low-power wireless sensor networks, a wealth of new applications at the interface of the real and digital worlds is emerging. A distributed computing platform that can measure properties of the real world, formulate intelligent inferences, and instrument responses, requires strong foundations in distributed computing, artificial intelligence, databases, control theory, and security. Before these intelligent systems can be deployed in critical infrastructures such as emergency rooms and powerplants, the security properties of sensors must be fully understood. Existing wisdom has been to apply the traditional security models and techniques to sensor networks. However, sensor networks are not traditional computing devices, and as a result, existing security models and methods are ill suited. In this position paper, we take the first steps towards producing a comprehensive security model that is tailored for sensor networks. Incorporating work from Internet security, ubiquitous computing, and distributed systems, we outline security properties that must be considered when designing a secure sensor network. We propose challenges for sensor networks - security obstacles that, when overcome, will move us closer to decreasing the divide between computers and the physical world.},

These cyber-risks could compromise the confidentiality (C), integrity (I), and availability (A) of the system, and eventually can lead to physical tampering of devices and its systems resulting in severe economic loss. In this paper, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach is proposed to detect the false data injection attack in the Home Area Networks. An early and accurate detection of false injected measurements are essential to undertake appropriate countermeasures to avert potential risks. The implemented ANN model is trained and tested extensively on a data set containing energy profile of 200 U.S. households that models FDI attack using two attack scenarios (e.g., on-peak and off-peak hours) with Sigmoid and Trapezoidal representations, and three activation functions. Then, ANN model is compared against other machine learning methods for evaluation. Several performance metrics such as accuracy (a) and probability of detection (Pd) are used. The preliminary results of ANN show promising results with Pd values reaching 99.4% on over support vector machine (Pd =80.5%) and random forest (Pd =88.2%) methods. Thus, deploying such detection algorithms at home area network levels will help identify and reduce these false data injection attacks.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the interactions between a base station (BS) and a full-duplex (FD) active eavesdropper in the uplink of multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Focusing on the resistance against simultaneous eavesdropping and jamming, we introduce a beam extraction method based on spatial information to eliminate pilot contamination, from which a beam-domain (BD) distributed receiving scheme is proposed to suppress the jamming mixed in users' signals. From a practical point of view, we use the perspective of a hierarchical game to analyze the interactions without the prior information of the eavesdropper. The results show that with the help of the proposed scheme, the performance of the FD-mode attack is inferior to that of passive eavesdropping. A statistical upper bound of eavesdropping is given in a closed-form, which is mainly determined by the direction and distance of the eavesdropper relative to users. Then, a joint power and combining matrix optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the secrecy capacity of the system.},

abstract={An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a necessity to protect against network attacks. The system monitors the activity within a network of connected computers in order to analyze the activity for intrusive patterns. Should an `attack' event happen, then the system has to respond accordingly. Different machine learning techniques have been proposed in the past roughly falling into two categories namely clustering algorithms and classification algorithms. In this paper, the IDS is designed with a neural network ensemble method to classify the different attacks. The neural network ensemble method comprises autoencoder, deep belief neural network, deep neural network, and an extreme learning machine. The NSL-KDD data set is used to measure the detection rate and false alarm rate of the implemented neural network ensemble method. The detection rate and false alarm rate are the two important measure for IDSs, however, several other measures are also reported on such as confusion matrix, classification accuracy, and AUC (area under curve).},

abstract={Attack detection problems in the smart grid are posed as statistical learning problems for different attack scenarios in which the measurements are observed in batch or online settings. In this approach, machine learning algorithms are used to classify measurements as being either secure or attacked. An attack detection framework is provided to exploit any available prior knowledge about the system and surmount constraints arising from the sparse structure of the problem in the proposed approach. Well-known batch and online learning algorithms (supervised and semisupervised) are employed with decision- and feature-level fusion to model the attack detection problem. The relationships between statistical and geometric properties of attack vectors employed in the attack scenarios and learning algorithms are analyzed to detect unobservable attacks using statistical learning methods. The proposed algorithms are examined on various IEEE test systems. Experimental analyses show that machine learning algorithms can detect attacks with performances higher than attack detection algorithms that employ state vector estimation methods in the proposed attack detection framework.},

abstract={Cloud-based systems are subject to various attack types launched by Virtual Machines (VMs) manipulated by attackers having different goals and skills. The existing detection and defense mechanisms might be suitable for simple attack environments but become ineffective when the system faces advanced attack scenarios wherein simultaneous attacks of different types are involved. This is because these mechanisms overlook the attackers' strategies in the detection system's design, ignore the system's resource constraints, and lack sufficient knowledge about the attackers' types and abilities. To address these shortcomings, we propose a repeated Bayesian Stackelberg game consisting of the following phases: risk assessment framework that identifies the VMs' risk levels, live-migration-based defense mechanism that protects services from being successful targets for attackers, machine-learning-based technique that collects malicious data from VMs using honeypots and employs one-class Support Vector Machine to learn the attackers' types distributions, and resource-aware Bayesian Stackelberg game that provides the hypervisor with the detection load's optimal distribution over VMs that maximizes the detection of multi-type attacks. Experiments conducted using Amazon's datacenter and Amazon Web Services honeypot data reveal that our solution maximizes the detection, minimizes the number of attacked services, and runs efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art detection and defense strategies, namely Collabra, probabilistic migration, Stackelberg, maxmin, and fair allocation.},

volume={9},

pages={80806-80820},
abstract={Microarchitectural data sampling (MDS) attacks leak secret data from the internal buffers of a processor to the attacker during transient execution. Because of the narrow window of transient execution, previous MDS attacks relied on repetitive sampling to obtain arbitrarily sized data from the buffer. However, as an MDS attacker cannot control the address for data leakage, such an approach significantly degrades the signal-to-noise ratio in the sampled data. In this paper, we propose a novel multibyte microarchitectural data sampling technique for performing MDS attacks. The proposed technique allows several continuous bytes to be captured in one execution without repetition of sampling. The implementation of the technique is quite challenging, because a transient execution window is not sufficiently large to allow multibyte sampling to be completed. We address this problem by leveraging a return stack buffer-based speculation technique, which originally was used for variants of Spectre-type attacks. We repurpose it to enlarge the transient execution window in our attack. Our implementations can capture data of up to 16 bytes in length in one execution from a line-fill buffer. To validate the effectiveness of the multibyte sampling technique, we demonstrate session key extraction attacks against secure network protocols. In particular, our objective is to extract AES-128 and AES-256 keys from TLS and SSH applications. To recover session keys in a postprocessing phase efficiently, we also propose a novel clustering-based search method that assembles the bytes of interest from the noisy sampled data. The experimental results show that our technique can successfully extract AES-128/256 session keys from victim applications with a probability of at least 98% and a reasonable search complexity.},

abstract={The decreased size and cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) has enabled the use of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles to accomplish a variety of tasks. By utilizing swarming behaviors, it is possible to efficiently accomplish coordinated tasks while minimizing per-drone computational requirements. Some drones rely on decentralized protocols that exhibit emergent behavior across the swarm. While fully decentralized algorithms remove obvious attack vectors their susceptibility to external influence is less understood. This work investigates the influences that can compromise the functionality of an autonomous swarm leading to hazardous situations and cascading vulnerabilities. When a swarm is tasked with missions involving the safety or health of humans, external influences could have serious consequences. The adversarial swarm in this work utilizes an attack vector embedded within the decentralized movement algorithm of a previously defined autonomous swarm designed to create a perimeter sentry swarm. Various simulations confirm the adversarial swarm's ability to capture significant portions (6-23%) of the perimeter.},

abstract={The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be advantageous in applications that serve in hostile environments such as security surveillance and military battlefield. The operation of a WSN typically involves collection of sensor measurements at an in-situ Base-Station (BS) that further processes the data and either takes action or reports findings to a remote command center. Thus the BS plays a vital role and is usually guarded by concealing its identity and location. However, the BS can be susceptible to traffic analysis attack. Given the limited communication range of the individual sensors and the objective of conserving their energy supply, the sensor readings are forwarded to the BS over multi-hop paths. Such a routing topology allows an adversary to correlate intercepted transmissions, even without being able to decode them, and apply attack models such as Evidence Theory (ET) in order to determine the position of the BS. This paper proposes a technique to counter such an attack by reshaping the routing topology. Basically, the nodes in a WSN are grouped in unevenly-sized clusters and each cluster has a designated aggregation node (cluster head). An inter-cluster head routes are then formed so that the BS experiences low traffic volume and does not become distinguishable among the WSN nodes. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique in boosting the anonymity of the BS.},

abstract={The huge variance of human pose and the misalign-ment of detected human images significantly increase the difficulty of pedestrian image matching in person Re-Identification (Re-ID). Moreover, the massive visual data being produced by surveillance video cameras requires highly efficient person Re-ID systems. Targeting to solve the first problem, this work proposes a robust and discriminative pedestrian image descriptor, namely, the Global-Local-Alignment Descriptor (GLAD). For the second problem, this work treats person Re-ID as image retrieval and proposes an efficient indexing and retrieval framework. GLAD explicitly leverages the local and global cues in the human body to generate a discriminative and robust representation. It consists of part extraction and descriptor learning modules, where several part regions are first detected and then deep neural networks are designed for representation learning on both the local and global regions. A hierarchical indexing and retrieval framework is designed to perform offline relevance mining to eliminate the huge person ID redundancy in the gallery set, and accelerate the online Re-ID procedure. Extensive experimental results on widely used public benchmark datasets show GLAD achieves competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods. On a large-scale person, with the Re-ID dataset containing more than 520 K images, our retrieval framework significantly accelerates the online Re-ID procedure while also improving Re-ID accuracy. Therefore, this work has the potential to work better on person Re-ID tasks in real scenarios.},

abstract={Mobile personal devices, such as smartphones, USB thumb drives, and sensors, are becoming essential elements of our modern lives. Their large-scale pervasive deployment within the population has already attracted many malware authors, cybercriminals, and even governments. Since the first demonstration of mobile malware by Marcos Velasco, millions of these have been developed with very sophisticated capabilities. They infiltrate highly secure networks using air-gap jumping capability (e.g., “Hammer Drill”and “Brutal Kangaroo”) and spread through heterogeneous computing and communication platforms. Some of these cross-platform malware attacks are capable of infiltrating isolated control systems which might be running a variety of operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Linux. This paper investigates cross-platform/heterogeneous mobile malware that uses removable media, such as USB connection, to spread between incompatible computing platforms and operating systems. Deep analysis and modeling of cross-platform mobile malware are conducted at the micro (infection) and macro (spread) levels. The micro-level analysis aims to understand the cross-platform malware states and transitions between these states during node-to-node infection. The micro-level analysis helps derive the parameters essential for macro-level analysis, which are also crucial for the elaboration of suitable detection and prevention solutions. The macro-level analysis aims to identify the most important factors affecting cross-platform mobile malware spread within a digitized population. Through simulation, we show that identifying these factors helps to mitigate any outbreaks.},

abstract={The simultaneous development of deep learning techniques and Internet of Things (IoT)/Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) technologies has afforded untold possibilities for improving distributed computing, sensing, and data analysis. Among these technologies, federated learning has received increased attention as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm, and has shown significant potential in IoT/CPS-driven large-scale smart-world systems. At the same time, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks, especially to adversarial attacks, cannot be overstated and should not be minimized. Moreover, the distributed nature of federated learning makes defense against such adversarial attacks a more challenging problem due to the unavailability of local data and resource heterogeneity. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose ZeKoC, a Zero Knowledge Clustering approach to mitigating adversarial attacks. Particularly, we first formulate the problem of resource-constrained adversarial mitigation. Specifically, noting that a global server has no access to training samples, we reformulate the unsupervised weight clustering problem. Our proposed ZeKoC approach allows the server to automatically split and merge weight clusters for weight selection and aggregation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that convergence is guaranteed. Further, our experimental results illustrate that, in a non-i.i.d. (i.e., independent and identically distributed) data setting, the proposed ZeKoC approach successfully mitigates general attacks while outperforming state-of-art schemes.},

This framework leverages both Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enablers for mitigating different threats. This AI framework combines monitoring agent and AI-based reaction agent that use ML-Models divided into network patterns analysis, along with anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT systems. The framework exploits the supervised learning, distributed data mining system and neural network for achieving its goals. Experiments results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. In particular, the distribution of the attacks using the data mining approach is highly successful in detecting the attacks with high performance and low cost. Regarding our anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for IoT, we have evaluated the experiment in a real Smart building scenario using one-class SVM. The detection accuracy of anomalies achieved 99.71%. A feasibility study is conducted to identify the current potential solutions to be adopted and to promote the research towards the open challenges.},

abstract={Advancements in smart control and the growing popularity of IoT devices have raised the demand of smart infrastructure. Smart buildings play a significant role in establishing a smart infrastructure. These buildings compose different subsystems that are connected through a complex cyber-physical network to a building management system (BMS). BMS monitors and controls components of a building with the help of various electronic components such as sensors, actuators, and measurement units. These devices are connected to the control center through communication networks. Due to the presence of a communication network, the system is always vulnerable to attacks in which an attacker can manipulate the sensors and measuring units and inject false data into the system. State estimation based techniques are used for fault detection, however, these techniques have limitations that encourage the demand for a more reliable system. The paper proposes a machine-learning algorithm to distinguish between normal state, fault state, and attack. The classification between fault and attack is achieved using the classifier learner tool in MATLAB. Support vector machine algorithm (SVM) is used to classify and through a comparative study, its superiority over other machine learning algorithms is shown. To validate the results various scenarios are considered to classify the different operating conditions.},

abstract={Images collected by linear scan cameras are stretched and compressed due to the speed regulation of trains. This condition changes the shape of objects and considerably increases the false and missed alarm rates. Moreover, small size and dense distribution of the key components in railway trains increase the difficulty in fault diagnosis. Therefore, a two-module troubleshooting and positioning methodology is proposed, in this article, for state diagnosis of key small components of high-speed running trains. First, the image with deformation is reshaped to be exactly the same as the standard one via omnidirectional scale correlation normalization (OSCN), which performs well even in low texture, high-light situations. Second, we propose three feature-enhanced models to expand the receptive field of deep feature maps. This novel detector, namely, refine-inception net (RIN), not only reduces the rate of missed and false detection, but also minimizes the influence of target size and occlusion. Augmentation is performed to increase robustness because the detector is data driven. Experimental results show that the optimal strategy combining OSCN and RIN can troubleshoot high-speed trains of different models with an accuracy higher than 99%. Our method can be extended to foreign object recognition on the train roof while maintaining railway safety.},

abstract={This paper aims at evaluating the capabilities to detect road traversability in urban and extra-urban scenarios of support vector machine-based classifiers that use local descriptors extracted from point cloud data. The evaluation of the proposed classifiers is carried out by using four different kernels and comparing five point descriptors obtained from geometric and appearance-based features. A comparison among the performance of descriptors individually has demonstrated that the normal vector-based descriptor achieves an accuracy of 88%, outperforming by about 6%-15% all the other considered ones. To further improve the interpretation capabilities, the space of features is augmented by merging the components of each point descriptor, reaching 92% classification accuracy. A set of test scenarios have been acquired during an extensive experimental campaign using an all-terrain vehicle. Tests on real data show high classification performance for road scenarios and rural environments; the generality of the method makes it applicable for different types of mobile robots including, but not limited to, autonomous vehicles.},

abstract={Given the importance of an early anomaly detection, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are introduced in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). Agents or probes form the cornerstone of any IDS by capturing network packets and extracting relevant information. However, IDSs are facing unprecedented challenges due to the escalation in the number, scale and diversity of attacks. Software-Defined Network (SDN) then comes into play and can provide the required flexibility and scalability. Building on that, we introduce Traffic Agent Controllers (TACs) that monitor SDN-enabled switches via Open-Flow. By using lightweight statistical metrics such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), we are able to detect the slightest anomalies, such as stealth port scans, even in the presence of background traffic. The obtained metrics can also be used to locate the anomalies with precision over 90% inside a hierarchical network topology.},

abstract={Android system applies a permission-based security model to restrict unauthorized apps from accessing system services, however, this security model cannot constrain authorized apps from sending excessive service requests to exhaust the limited system resource allocated for each system service. As references from native code to a Java object, JNI Global References (JGR) are prone to memory leaks, since they are not automatically garbage collected. Moreover, JGR exhaustion may lead to process abort or even Android system reboot when the victim process could not afford the JGR requests triggered by malicious apps through inter-process communication. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on JGR exhaustion (JGRE) attacks against all system services in Android. Our experimental results show that among the 104 system services in Android 6.0.1, 32 system services have 54 vulnerabilities. Particularly, 22 system services can be successfully attacked without any permission support. After reporting those vulnerabilities to Android security team and getting confirmed, we study the existing ad hoc countermeasures in Android against JGRE attacks. Surprisingly, among the 10 system services that have been protected, 8 system services are still vulnerable to JGRE attacks. Finally, we develop an effective defense mechanism to defeat all identified JGRE attacks by adopting Android's low memory killer (LMK) mechanism.},

abstract={Deep neural networks have been found to be easily misled by adversarial examples that are maliciously crafted by adding small perturbations. A variety of methods have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but more efforts are needed to generate them with high perceptual quality and low computation costs. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack method that uses a conditional encoder-decoder network named Image-To-Perturbation to generate adversarial perturbations in residual learning fashion. Image-To-Perturbation network can learn the mapping from clean images to according adversarial perturbations, once it is trained, it can generate perturbations for any examples efficiently. We test the proposed method on different target models using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experimental results show that our model is easy to train and the generated adversarial examples are perceptually realistic and achieve high attack success rate.},

abstract={Adversarial perturbations of clean images are usually imperceptible for human eyes, but can confidently fool deep neural networks (DNNs) to make incorrect predictions. Such vulnerability of DNNs raises serious security concerns about their practicability in security-sensitive applications. To defend against such adversarial perturbations, recently developed PixelDefend purifies a perturbed image based on PixelCNN in a raster scan order (row/column by row/column). However, such scan mode insufficiently exploits the correlations between pixels, which further limits its robustness performance. Therefore, we propose a more advanced Hilbert curve scan order to model the pixel dependencies in this paper. Hilbert curve could well preserve local consistency when mapping from 2-D image to 1-D vector, thus the local features in neighboring pixels can be more effectively modeled. Moreover, the defensive power can be further improved via ensembles of Hilbert curve with different orientations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art defenses against various adversarial attacks.},

Since poorly secured embedded devices and Internet of Things applications form a profitable matrix for criminal activity, a deeper understanding of the existent risks is needed. Threat intelligence is crucial to increase the security in terms of prevention, detection and mitigation of attacks. Honeypots are a well establish technology that provide more insights about the behavior of adversaries by luring attacks into a monitored decoy. Any interaction with this decoy is suspicious and forwarded for further investigation. By analyzing the observed attack parameters it is possible to reveal recent trends, new attack vectors and ongoing intrusion attempts. Since embedded systems are the focus of the proposed honeypot, CPU architectures, as well as system resources are chosen to imitate embedded devices. In the reference implementation, the authentication mechanism is prone to brute-force and dictionary attacks.},

pages={417-422},
abstract={Anomaly detection techniques analyze consumer spend patterns and grid load profiles to predict possible deviations from normal behavior. However, as the measured data is time-varying, profiling the measured drifts becomes complex owing to the amount of raw generated data. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, in this paper, we propose a scheme, AnSMart, to predict deviations in smart grid (SG) data through obtained profiling operations. The scheme operates in two phases. In the first phase, valuable grid features are extracted from internal system call lists made by grid kernels after load profiling operations are completed over a day. Then, in the second phase, based on data logs, vector differences are computed for call vectors and malign scenarios are identified. The data is fed to the support vector machine (SVM) model for training, and compromised grid behavior is classified. SVM predicts metrics deviation from normal grids. The deviation is measured depending on parameters like-call vector signal, call-sizes, call-list deviations, and call-return values collected from the open-source libiec61850 library that consists of resource-rich (RR) and resource-limited (RL) libraries for both compromised and uncompromised grids. Based on different cases, a total of 50 experiments were conducted. The obtained F-score is 0.926 and the accuracy of 92.5% is obtained based on system-call stacks and grid operating system (OS) behavior that outperforms the conventional anomaly-based approaches on SG.},

The detection module extracts network features and analyzes them to decide whether the network is in a normal state. We use smart energy profile 2.0 specification as well as IEEE 802.15.4 standard to precisely characterize the expected normal behavior. A set of defensive actions are defined for the prevention system which are effective in stopping various attack types. HANIDPS uses Q-learning and through interactions with environment learns the best strategy against an attack. Use of model-based approach for intrusion detection and dynamic learning for intrusion prevention, as well as employment of effective mechanisms to stop the attacks, provide a high performance for HANIDPS without the need for prior knowledge of the attacks. Soundness of the proposed method is evaluated through extensive analysis and experiments.},

volume={7},

pages={13917-13926},
abstract={In recent years, a type of cyberattacks, known as advanced persistent threats, has resulted in very serious losses to various organizations such as governments and enterprises. The APT has the characteristics of long duration, complex attack means, and strong ability to conceal themselves, which make it difficult to detect them. Due to the lack of proper means to protect the Information-centric IoT (ICIoT), the ICIoT devices are extremely vulnerable to APT attacks. Moreover, among the existing APT detection methods, most researchers adopt those that extract the features of different APT attacks, and most of the features extracted are local, which leads to the fact that the related methods have poor scalability, thus reducing the accuracy. Furthermore, the attackers can easily avoid the detection by changing the local features. In this paper, we find that it is inevitable that the infected host will generate C&C communication with the command and control server (C&C server), during the process of APT attacks, and the C&C domain names are the bridge connecting the internal infection with the C&C server. Moreover, a certain APT attack of one attack family, which is the assembly of the same APT attacks, tends to map the C&C domain names to the same IP subnet. Under the assumption that the APT attackers have limited attack resources, the relationship between C&C domain names of APT and IP subnet is inevitable for the APT attackers to get higher attack efficiency, which leads to the effective tracking of APT attack behavior. Therefore, we construct a detection method based on the domain names' graph structure. This detection method can improve the detection efficiency in the information-centric internet, especially for the IoT devices. And, at the same time, we employ an appropriate pruning strategy and a preprocessing method to reduce the size of data to be processed and improve the computational efficiency. This detection method can also reduce the detection range, increase the detection accuracy, and improve the robustness and scalability of the detection system. In the actual experiment, the data size we process is 257535071 DNS requests and 73136 domain names. The experiment shows that the C&C domain names can be effectively detected even with a small-scale seed domain names.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network comprised of heterogeneous devices that can exchange data without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. However, there are various vulnerabilities found due to the heterogeneity of the IoT network. Moreover, the mobility of IoT devices causes potential dynamic changes to the attack surfaces of IoT networks. As a result, static network security analysis approaches cannot capture these changes. In order to address this problem, we present an IoT security assessment approach by modelling different movement patterns of mobile IoT devices. Graphical security models are used in conjunction to evaluate the security of the IoT networks taking into account the mobility of the IoT devices. Further, we use various security metrics to analyze the security of the network to show the changing security posture when mobility is taken into account. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing the security of an example mobile IoT network using three existing synthetic mobility models: Random Waypoint, Gauss-Markov and Reference Point Group. The experimental analysis shows the changing attack surface of the IoT networks when mobile devices are considered.},

We propose robust join, leave, merge and split operations to discourage brute force denial of services and pollution attacks. We show that combining a small amount of randomization in the operations, and adequately tuning the sojourn time of peers in the same region of the overlay allows first to decrease the effect of targeted attacks at cluster level, and second to prevent pollution propagation in the whole overlay.},

abstract={Smart farming is a new concept that makes agriculture more efficient and effective by using advanced information technologies. The latest advancements in connectivity, automation, and artificial intelligence enable farmers better to monitor all procedures and apply precise treatments determined by machines with superhuman accuracy. Farmers, data scientists and, engineers continue to work on techniques that allow optimizing the human labor required in farming. With valuable information resources improving day by day, smart farming turns into a learning system and becomes even smarter. Deep learning is a type of machine learning method, using artificial neural network principles. The main feature by which deep learning networks are distinguished from neural networks is their depth and that feature makes them capable of discovering latent structures within unlabeled, unstructured data. Deep learning networks that do not need human intervention while performing automatic feature extraction have a significant advantage over previous algorithms. The focus of this study is to explore the advantages of using deep learning in agricultural applications. This bibliography reviews the potential of using deep learning techniques in agricultural industries.

abstract={Smart grid is a cyber-physical system with interdependent power grid and communication network. Such interdependence make the smart grid fragile against cascading failures, where an initial failure in communication network may lead to further failures in power grid, and vice versa. We prevent such inter-network cascading failure by stopping an initial failure from propagating. This is achieved by providing a sufficient number of power-disjoint communication routes between power nodes and control center. The number of power-disjoint routes is a robustness metric. We aim to maximize robustness by configuring the interdependence relationship between power grid and communication networks. Such relationship indicates which power node supplies energy to which communication node, and which communication route is used to connect which power node to the control center. Following Menger's Theorem, we transform such configuration problem into a Maxflow problem and solve it using the simplex algorithm. We have evaluated the proposed method through extensive simulations. The results confirm the optimality and computational efficiency of the proposed method. The number of power-disjoint routes increases with an increase in the network size, but can never exceed the number of node-disjoint routes for a same network.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network (WSN) works in a complex environment where it is difficult for people to reach or work. The openness of nodes leads to security threats vulnerable to various attacks. The trust and reputation model can be applied in WSN to reduce damage caused by malicious nodes. However, there is a high false-positive rate in trust and reputation models because a node with less reputation due to the communication environment is judged as a malicious one directly. This paper presents a trust & reputation-based malicious node identification strategy with environmental parameters (TRS&EP) to interdict the malicious nodes, such as interrupt attack nodes and selective forwarding attack nodes. Using the linear regression of machine learning and combining the energy of nodes, data volume, number of adjacent nodes, the node sparsity and other deterministic parameters can solve environmental parameters. Then TRS&EP estimates benchmark trust according to the environmental parameters. The Gaussian radial basis function is simplified to calculate the similarity between the benchmark trust sequence and cycle reputation sequence. Furthermore, TRS&EP sets three reputation intervals and an adoptive threshold span to identify the malicious nodes by dynamically considering the work environment and states of nodes. The simulated results show that TRS&EP improves the recognition of malicious nodes above 1% compared to comparison algorithms and reduces the false-positive percentage by more than 1%.},

abstract={Adversarial examples (AEs) make Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems to face a great challenge. The tiny fluctuations in AEs mislead the learning model, let the model accept, and make wrong decisions. So, accurately identifying AEs is significant for improving the robustness in IoT systems. In this article, a method to identify AEs for time-series data is proposed. We analyze the characteristics of adversarial time-series examples and normal time-series samples and propose a time-series representation method. The tiny fluctuations in AEs are easily discovered by this representation. A metric is also designed to support this representation method to identify AEs with supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods. Our representation method and the metric is applied with supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods to identify time series in real data set and data sets in the official UCR repository. The experimental results show that our method has a great ability to identify AEs, compared to previous approaches.},

abstract={Network defenses based on traditional tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) fail to account for the attacker's inherent advantage present due to the static nature of network services and configurations. To take away this asymmetric advantage, Moving Target Defense (MTD) continuously shifts the configuration of the underlying system, in turn reducing the success rate of cyberattacks. In this survey, we analyze the recent advancements made in the development of MTDs and highlight (1) how these defenses can be defined using common terminology, (2) can be made more effective with the use of artificial intelligence techniques for decision making, (3) be implemented in practice and (4) evaluated. We first define an MTD using a simple and yet general notation that captures the key aspects of such defenses. We then categorize these defenses into different sub-classes depending on what they move, when they move and how they move. In trying to answer the latter question, we showcase the use of domain knowledge and game-theoretic modeling can help the defender come up with effective and efficient movement strategies. Second, to understand the practicality of these defense methods, we discuss how various MTDs have been implemented and find that networking technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization act as key enablers for implementing these dynamic defenses. We then briefly highlight MTD test-beds and case-studies to aid readers who want to examine or deploy existing MTD techniques. Third, our survey categorizes proposed MTDs based on the qualitative and quantitative metrics they utilize to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of security and performance. We use well-defined metrics such as risk analysis and performance costs for qualitative evaluation and metrics based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), attack representation, QoS impact, and targeted threat models for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we show that our categorization of MTDs is effective in identifying novel research areas and highlight directions for future research.},

abstract={The sequence comparison of large-scale string-typed data is fundamental in computer science and other computational disciplines. Its development has been promoted into an emerging outsourcing service by the almost unlimited powerful computing and storage capabilities from public clouds. The privacy preservation and effective utility of the outsourced sensitive information are key requirements now facing this service. All of the secure two-party computation protocols in existing solutions, however, cannot be free from the assumption of non-colluding servers under multi-server models, and thus fail to defend against some attacks from cloud service providers. For this reason, we present encrypted sequence comparison (E-SC), the first security system that works by executing encrypted sequence comparison under a single-server model. Two character sequences are encrypted by end users before outsourcing, while the encrypted character sequences are compared directly by a single cloud server to return their similarity results. To accomplish this goal, novel computable encryption algorithms are designed in this paper. Then, a collusion-resistant outsourcing is achieved using non-interactive padding, partition, and expansion mechanisms. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the client-side overhead is quadratic in the input number of salt values, along with an optimal server-side performance. Also, the overall runtime of our E-SC system is positively correlated with its security level, which is more practical in realistic applications.},

abstract={We propose a data driven approach for modeling head motion behavior in human dyadic interactions, by establishing a structure for unconstrained natural head movement. Using recordings of couples' conversations in real psychotherapy sessions, we first track the head of each subject, compute the head motion and detect active versus non-active intervals. For detected active intervals, we use a sliding window to collect motion sequences. Linear Prediction Coefficients are used to represent the sequence, based on which we train a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) such that each mixture would ideally associate with one type of prototypical movement, which we will refer to as a “kineme”. For each complete interaction session, we compute the sum of posterior probabilities of all sequences over the GMM normalized by session length to predict specific “low” versus “high” expert annotated behavior code scores for Acceptance, Blame, Positive and Negative behaviors. We achieved an overall accuracy of about 70% employing these GMMs. This result shows data driven modeling of head motion provides useful information for human behavioral analysis.},

Many step counters, relying on accelerometer data, are widely available. However, accelerometer-based algorithms are prone to overcounting. In our proposed method, feature points are detected first. Then, in order to increase robustness and accuracy especially in the case of highly-textured ground and floor surfaces, Kalman filter based tracking is performed. The proposed method is compared with existing accelerometer-based step counters. Experiments are performed with multiple subjects carrying five mobile devices simultaneously, including smart phones and watches, at different locations on their body. A SamsungTM Galaxy S4 smartphone is used to capture the videos. The results show that the proposed camera-based footstep counting has the lowest average error rate for different users, and is more reliable compared to accelerometer-based counters. The average error rate for the proposed method is 2.68%, and the standard deviation of the error is 2.39%.},

Since it is independent from the availability of road markings and the knowledge of street courses, application in dense urban areas with high rates dynamic objects and road users is possible. This paper introduces novel methods for vehicular environment perception via LiDAR scanner and stereo camera, as well as models for their association with a high-precision digital map to estimate the vehicle's position via Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization. Evaluation in urban areas indicates the potential for global positioning accuracy below 0.30 m for LiDAR and below 0.50 m for stereo camera, as well as a corresponding heading error below 1°.},

abstract={Information security remains an unsolved challenge for organizations, because every day brings new and sophisticated cyber-attacks. The implementation of network security operation systems is a new trend in the companies, to permanently monitor the logs and, in case of any anomalous traffic, to detect and hopefully prevent any security incident. These systems generate a huge amount of logs per second to be handled, leading to the need of automated ways to identify the cyber-attacks.In this paper we propose an effective Log-based Intrusion Detection System (LIDS), to predict an attack or not, based on carefully selected features. The logs from various sources are aggregated into one dashboard and the most discriminative features are first determined. For the attack prediction, a few machine learning techniques were comparatively tested, with the Decision tree being the winner. The proposed system is illustrated with the largest publicly available labelled log file dataset KDD Cup 1999.},

abstract={This paper investigates the effect of data integrity attacks on the central control of the microgrids (MGs), which can lead to severe blackouts and load shedding. It assesses this cyber attack from the steady state and optimal scheduling point of view. In order to stop the cyber hacking, a new deep learning-based framework has been developed based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this framework, two networks compete with each other, wherein the first network generates fake data, and the second one is responsible for the data classification. In order to get into the most optimal features, a new optimization method based on a modified teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is also devised to reinforce the GAN model and help a better matching training process. In addition, a new modification is introduced for TLBO to avoid premature convergence and provide high population diversity. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a real dataset of several smart metering devices in a MG has been tested. Results illustrate the high performance of the proposed framework, comparing to the well-known conventional detection frameworks with hit rate of 93.11%, miss rate of 6.89%, false alarm rate of 7.76% and correct reject rate of 92.24%.},

abstract={Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent in many real-world applications including security critical ones. Due to the high hardware requirement and time consumption to train high-performance neural network models, users often outsource training to a machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) provider. This puts the integrity of the trained model at risk. In 2017, Liu et al. found that, by mixing the training data with a few malicious samples of a certain trigger pattern, hidden functionality can be embedded in the trained network which can be evoked by the trigger pattern [33]. We refer to this kind of hidden malicious functionality as neural Trojans. In this paper, we survey a myriad of neural Trojan attack and defense techniques that have been proposed over the last few years. In a neural Trojan insertion attack, the attacker can be the MLaaS provider itself or a third party capable of adding or tampering with training data. In most research on attacks, the attacker selects the Trojan's functionality and a set of input patterns that will trigger the Trojan. Training data poisoning is the most common way to make the neural network acquire the Trojan functionality. Trojan embedding methods that modify the training algorithm or directly interfere with the neural network's execution at the binary level have also been studied. Defense techniques include detecting neural Trojans in the model and/or Trojan trigger patterns, erasing the Trojan's functionality from the neural network model, and bypassing the Trojan. It was also shown that carefully crafted neural Trojans can be used to mitigate other types of attacks. We systematize the above attack and defense approaches in this paper.},

abstract={Robust control and management of the grid relies on accurate data. Both phasor measurement units and remote terminal units are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is crucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of tampered data-both for preventing attacks that may lead to blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control of current and future grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme based on the Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the conditional covariance test CMIT to learn the structure of the grid. Using the dc power flow model, we show that, under normal circumstances, the Markov graph of the voltage angles is consistent with the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between the calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Our method can detect the most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge of the bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state estimator; hence damaging power network control, monitoring, demand response, and pricing scheme. Specifically, under the stealthy deception attack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detecting a state of attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated attack and it does not need additional hardware. Moreover, it is successful no matter the size of the attacked subset. Simulation of various power networks confirms our claims.},

abstract={Journalists have long been the targets of both physical and cyber-attacks from well-resourced adversaries. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are arguably a new avenue of threat towards journalists through both targeted and generalised cyber-physical exploitation. This study comprises three parts: First, we interviewed 11 journalists and surveyed 5 further journalists, to determine the extent to which journalists perceive threats through the IoT, particularly via consumer IoT devices. Second, we surveyed 34 cyber security experts to establish if and how lay-people can combat IoT threats. Third, we compared these findings to assess journalists' knowledge of threats, and whether their protective mechanisms would be effective against experts' depictions and predictions of IoT threats. Our results indicate that journalists generally are unaware of IoT-related risks and are not adequately protecting themselves; this considers cases where they possess IoT devices, or where they enter IoT-enabled environments (e.g., at work or home). Expert recommendations spanned both immediate and longterm mitigation methods, including practical actions that are technical and socio-political in nature. However, all proposed individual mitigation methods are likely to be short-term solutions, with 26 of 34 (76.5%) of cyber security experts responding that within the next five years it will not be possible for the public to opt-out of interaction with the IoT.},

abstract={Cyber attacks consisting of several attack actions can present considerable challenge to forensic investigations. Consider the case where a cybersecurity breach is suspected following the discovery of one attack action, for example by observing the modification of sensitive registry keys, suspicious network traffic patterns, or the abuse of legitimate credentials. At this point, the investigator can have multiple options as to what to check next to discover the rest, and will likely pick one based on experience and training. This will be the case at each new step. We argue that the efficiency of this aspect of the job, which is the selection of what next step to take, can have significant impact on its overall cost (e.g., the duration) of the investigation and can be improved through the application of constrained optimization techniques. Here, we present DISCLOSE, the first data-driven decision support framework for optimizing forensic investigations of cybersecurity breaches. DISCLOSE benefits from a repository of known adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), for each of which it harvests threat intelligence information to calculate its probabilistic relations with the rest. These relations, as well as a proximity parameter derived from the projection of quantitative data regarding the adversarial TTPs on an attack life cycle model, are both used as input to our optimization framework. We show the feasibility of this approach in a case study that consists of 31 adversarial TTPs, data collected from 6 interviews with experienced cybersecurity professionals and data extracted from the MITRE ATT&CK STIX repository and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).},

However, machine learning based systems (MLBSs), those systems that incorporate them, have proven vulnerable to various new attacks as a result. Currently, there exists no systematic process for eliciting security requirements for MLBSs that incorporates the identification of adversarial machine learning (AML) threats with those of a traditional non-MLBS. In this research study, we explore the applicability of traditional threat modeling and existing attack libraries in addressing MLBS security in the requirements phase. Using an example MLBS, we examined the applicability of 1) DFD and STRIDE in enumerating AML threats; 2) Microsoft SDL AI/ML Bug Bar in ranking the impact of the identified threats; and 3) the Microsoft AML attack library in eliciting threat mitigations to MLBSs. Such a method has the potential to assist team members, even with only domain specific knowledge, to collaboratively mitigate MLBS threats.},

abstract={One of the technical challenges in power systems operation is to prevent/tackle undervoltage, which can result in overheating of the equipment or even cascading failures under severe circumstances. Hence, it can be considered as an intention for cyberattackers to target smart distribution systems leading to undervoltage(s). This paper proposes a bi-level framework to attack a distribution network such that: 1) load centers and renewable-based distributed generation units are simultaneously targeted, 2) the attack bypasses the AC state estimation-based bad data detection, and most importantly, 3) the attacker targets the most vulnerable region of the system at the optimal time instead of attacking random sections/entire system at a random time. The effectiveness of the framework is validated on an IEEE standard distribution system modified to contain photovoltaic arrays.},

abstract={Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK's Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.},

abstract={Nowadays, the serious security threat of industrial control system and sensors has become a major challenge with the rapid development of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a very common intrusion method, which will make a great security threat in the application of IIoT. In IIoT scenario, the lightweight safety certification can play a very important role in the development of data-intensive and decentralized applications running on billions of sensors and devices, preserving their security. Therefore, in this paper, a low-latency high-reliability security mechanism is proposed to avoid the MITM attack in IIoT scenario. First, combining the radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technology with IIoT applications, a lightweight IIoT security architecture is proposed. Based on the proposed IIoT security architecture, the process of device access authentication and communication service is illustrated. Second, according to the requirement of IIoT identification method, an access authentication method of the device is proposed based on the RFF. The method of feature extraction, classifier designing, and the access authentication process is discussed in detail. Finally, the simulation results show that the identification rate of devices can reach 95% under SNR = 6 dB, and can nearly reach 100% under SNR = 15 dB. Through the new process of access authentication, the access authentication rate can reach 95% under SNR = 15 dB. Therefore, according to the simulation results, the new security mechanisms based on RFF can be used to avoid the MITM attack in IIoT scenario.},

In this paper, we present an effective and practical scheme for detecting data integrity and selective forwarding attacks launched by malicious relays in wireless IoT networks. The proposed scheme exploits the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and provides a sentinel based approach to intrusion detection. Our detection scheme assumes a general noise model for the network where different wireless links may have different packet error probability (PEP). Further, our detection scheme is effective even in scenarios where different wireless links in the network employ distinct modulation and coding schemes at the physical layer.

abstract={As the prevalence and everyday use of machine learning algorithms, along with our reliance on these algorithms grow dramatically, so do the efforts to attack and undermine these algorithms with malicious intent, resulting in a growing interest in adversarial machine learning. A number of approaches have been developed that can render a machine learning algorithm ineffective through poisoning or other types of attacks. Most attack algorithms typically use sophisticated optimization approaches, whose objective function is designed to cause maximum damage to accuracy or performance of the algorithm with respect to some task. In this effort, we show that while such an objective function is indeed brutally effective in causing maximum damage on an embedded feature selection task, it often results in an attack mechanism that can be easily detected with an embarrassingly simple novelty or outlier detection algorithm. We then propose an equally simple yet elegant solution by adding a regularization term to the attacker's objective function that penalizes outlying attack points.},

abstract={In cervical cancer screening, accurate segmentation of cervical nucleus is a key part in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, the cervical nucleus segmentation faces many great challenges owing to the overlapping cervical cells, uneven staining and poor contrast of cervical cytology smear images. In this paper, a tree domain structure and screening algorithm based on depth-first searching strategy are proposed to obtain candidate nucleus regions according to the annular clustering characteristics of nucleus depth information in cervical cytology images. Then, the candidate nucleus regions are finely segmented with an iterative level set algorithm based on adaptive radius morphological dilation. Experimental results are evaluated on the ISBI2015 public dataset. The performance of the proposed nucleus segmentation algorithm is higher than that of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, recall of the cervical nucleus segmentation.},

abstract={The usage of Internet of Things (IoT)/ Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) has grown up exponentially, as expected 50 Billion IoT devices will get connected by the end of 2020 in the world in smart city environment. Advancement of Human Driven Edge Computing (HEC) with 5th Generation Internet services also makes this more feasible. Use of IoT and increased demand of BYOD becomes one of the fundamental needs to increase the organization employee productivity and business agility. But it increased the significant risk of the cyber-attack which is leading a major reason for business disruption and becomes a leading question about how to get a cyber secured citizenship in the smart city environment as well as in the organization where BYOD is used in large numbers. In order to conduct forensic investigation post incident detection of malicious activities from IoT/BYOD end point is most challenging task. A strategic practical approach in this research is presented to detect malicious activities so that organization can adopt to protect the critical infrastructure and smart city critical infrastructure. In order to achieve the goal of detecting of malicious activities in BYOD environment, simulation performed in 3 phases. The 1st phase of the simulation performed while BYOD endpoint was outside the organization over the internet without VPN. The 2nd phase of the simulation was performed where BYOD endpoint was securely onboarded using a corporate wireless network with a secured onboarding process. The 3rd phase of the test done where IoT/BYOD was outside the organization with a VPN. A unique robust scalable model puts forward with significant result from this research and concluded for creating a cyber forensic ecosystem in IoT/BYOD environment to enable cyber secured citizenship in era of HEC with 5G and IoT.},

abstract={Several optimization problems from various types of applications have been efficiently resolved using available meta-heuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. Recently, many meta-heuristic optimization techniques have been extensively reported in the literature. Nevertheless, there is still room for new optimization techniques and strategies since, according to the literature, there is no meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that may be considered as the best choice to cope with all modern optimization problems. This paper introduces a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm named Dynamic Group-based Optimization Algorithm (DGCO). The proposed algorithm is inspired by the cooperative behavior adopted by swarm individuals to achieve their global goals. DGCO has been validated and tested against twenty-three mathematical optimization problems, and the results have been verified by a comparative study with respect to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms that are already available. The results have shown the high exploration capabilities of DGCO as well as its ability to avoid local optima. Moreover, the performance of DGCO has also been verified against five constrained engineering design problems. The results demonstrate the competitive performance and capabilities of DGCO with respect to well-known state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of different parameters on the performance of the DGCO algorithm.},

abstract={The growing adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is enabling intelligent power grid applications. However, strong reliance on ICTs makes the grid susceptible to cyber attacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). This paper shows how deep learning approaches can be used to craft FDIAs against power grid state estimation that can circumvent the grid's bad data detector (BDD). In particular, we utilize conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to learn the distribution of the power grid measurement data and produce fake measurements that are identical in distribution to the real ones. Under the proposed algorithm, the attacker needs to have access to the grid's measurement data and know what data types in order to inject into the measurement system. No other prior knowledge about the grid is required. This type of threat model is novel and has not been considered so far. The simulation results on IEEE 14-bus system shows that FDIAs generated by our best performing cGAN implementation trained using real-world load data sets can bypass the BDD with a very high probability. Moreover, the distance between the distributions of the real and fake measurements (with FDIAs), measured in terms of the Jensen-Shannon divergence has a very low value, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed FDIA design approach.},

abstract={Adversarial attacks involve adding, small, often imperceptible, perturbations to inputs with the goal of getting a machine learning model to misclassifying them. While many different adversarial attack strategies have been proposed on image classification models, object detection pipelines have been much harder to break. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to craft adversarial examples by solving a constrained optimization problem using an adversarial generator network. Our approach is fast and scalable, requiring only a forward pass through our trained generator network to craft an adversarial sample. Unlike in many attack strategies we show that the same trained generator is capable of attacking new images without explicitly optimizing on them. We evaluate our attack on a trained Faster R-CNN face detector on the cropped 300-W face dataset where we manage to reduce the number of detected faces to 0.5% of all originally detected faces. In a different experiment, also on 300-W, we demonstrate the robustness of our attack to a JPEG compression based defense typical JPEG compression level of 75% reduces the effectiveness of our attack from only 0.5% of detected faces to a modest 5.0%.},

In this paper, we develop a spiking-neural-network-based technique for dynamic cyber-attack detection in a smart grid. This is achieved through judiciously integrating spiking neurons with a special recurrent neural network called the delayed feedback reservoir computing. The inter-spike interval encoding is also explored in the precise-spike-driven synaptic plasticity based training process. The simulation results suggest that the introduced method outperforms multi-layer perceptrons and can achieve a significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the delay value in the delayed feedback reservoir will have a substantial impact on the overall system performance.},

pages={292-305},
abstract={In Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS), low-critical applications have a larger attack surface compared to high-critical applications. Even though MCS isolate criticality domains of execution by design, a threat affecting a low-critical service can alter the execution of a high-critical task: e.g by degrading the system availability or user-experience. Such attack on low-critical tasks can even introduce an entry point for propagating the attack further to high-critical tasks. In this context, detecting such threats in applications during runtime is a major issue for MCS security. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) monitoring is a common security technique for runtime threat detection in program execution: using a predefined policy, it identifies unauthorized control-flow (CF) transitions as malicious activity. Recent research has introduced the use of hardware-assisted CF tracing for CFI monitoring into industrial real-time systems, since such implementation does not require instrumentation of the monitored program. However, CF tracing brings a high performance overhead for monitoring, which depends on the monitored program execution path (the more executed CF transitions, the higher the overhead). On one hand to integrate the security service in a MCS, we must consider the worst-case monitoring overhead. On the other hand, this assumption is highly pessimistic for a practical deployment. We propose a first safety-aware method to integrate hardware-assisted CF based security monitoring with ARM CoreSight into a MCS, and metrics to evaluate the trade-off between performance impact and security monitoring coverage. Our security framework combines a predictable CF transition level monitoring with trace collection that can be used for CFI checking, together with an anomaly detection service to monitor the full program execution. We validate our approach on an industrial MCS platform with ARM CoreSight support, using a set of programs from TACLeBench benchmark.},

abstract={Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a largely unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of autonomous DL systems. With the wide-spread usage of DL in critical and time-sensitive applications, including unmanned vehicles, drones, and video surveillance systems, online detection of malicious inputs is of utmost importance. We propose DeepFense, the first end-to-end automated framework that simultaneously enables efficient and safe execution of DL models. DeepFense formalizes the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the victim DL model. DeepFense leverages hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration to achieve just-in-time performance in resource-constrained settings. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce the non-recurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various platforms. Extensive evaluations on FPGAs and GPUs demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement while enabling online adversarial sample detection.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a new fault diagnosis (FD) -based approach for image change detection (ICD) that can detect significant changes as inconsistencies between different visual experiences of monocular-SLAM. Unlike classical change detection approaches such as pairwise image comparison (PC) and anomaly detection (AD), neither the memorization of each map image nor the maintenance of up-to-date placespecific anomaly detectors are required in this FD approach. A significant challenge that is encountered when incorporating different visual experiences into FD involves dealing with the varying scales of changed objects. To address this issue, we reconsider the bag-of-words (BoW) image representation, and focus on the state-of-the-art BoW-based SLAM paradigm. As a key advantage, the local feature -based representation enables to re-organize the BoW into any different scales without modifying the database entries (i.e., the map). Furthermore, it enables to control discriminative power and expected inconsistencies of local features. Experiments on challenging cross-season ICD using publicly available NCLT dataset, and comparison against state-of-the-art ICD algorithms validate the efficacy of the proposed FD approach with/without combining AD and/or PC.},

abstract={Anomaly Detection (AD) in images is a fundamental computer vision problem and refers to identifying images and/or image substructures that deviate significantly from the norm. Popular AD algorithms commonly try to learn a model of normality from scratch using task specific datasets, but are limited to semi-supervised approaches employing mostly normal data due to the inaccessibility of anomalies on a large scale combined with the ambiguous nature of anomaly appearance. We follow an alternative approach and demonstrate that deep feature representations learned by discriminative models on large natural image datasets are well suited to describe normality and detect even subtle anomalies in a transfer learning setting. Our model of normality is established by fitting a multivariate Gaussian (MVG) to deep feature representations of classification networks trained on ImageNet using normal data only. By subsequently applying the Mahalanobis distance as the anomaly score we outperform the current state of the art on the public MVTec AD dataset, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 95.8 ± 1.2% (mean ± SEM) over all 15 classes. We further investigate why the learned representations are discriminative to the AD task using Principal Component Analysis. We find that the principal components containing little variance in normal data are the ones crucial for discriminating between normal and anomalous instances. This gives a possible explanation to the often subpar performance of AD approaches trained from scratch using normal data only. By selectively fitting a MVG to these most relevant components only, we are able to further reduce model complexity while retaining AD performance. We also investigate setting the working point by selecting acceptable False Positive Rate thresholds based on the MVG assumption.

abstract={The success of a detection model depends heavily on feature engineering. Deep learning has been successfully applied in numerous research fields as a universal representation learning method. However, the heterogeneity of flow-level communication data obstructs the application of deep learning to communication representation learning, and research on this problem is still lacking. To cope with this problem, we propose a heterogeneous communication data-encoding approach to extract fixed-size encoding data to apply deep learning to heterogeneous communication data by preserving the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data. Then, we propose a feature extractor based on deep learning to automatically learn hierarchical and robust communication representations without expert knowledge. We show that the proposed approach can replicate and optimize the key steps of feature engineering well and learn hierarchical representations directly from heterogeneous communication data. Moreover, compared with features extracted with principal component analysis (PCA), manifold learning and manually crafted methods, the features extracted by deep learning are more robust and are characterized by their better adaptability to various classifiers and datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the initial work here is the first to apply deep learning techniques to heterogeneous flow-level data; consequently, the heterogeneous communication data processing method can provide technical means for the application of deep learning in other communication-related research fields.},

pages={31762-31773},
abstract={False data injection (FDI) attacks, as a new class of cyberattacks, bring a severe threat to the security and reliable operation of the smart grid by damaging the state estimation of the power system. To address this issue, an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based one-class-one-network (OCON) framework is proposed for detecting the FDI attacks in this paper. Under this framework, to effectively detect bus-based FDI attacks and identify the bus node being attacked, the subnets of state identification layer in OCON adopt the ELM algorithm to accurately divide the false data and the normal data. After that, a global layer is employed to analyze whether the bus node associated with its corresponding subnet is attacked by false data utilizing the results from the state identification layer. Finally, in order to improve the resilience of the power system, a prediction recovery strategy is proposed to remedy the detected false data by exploiting the spatial correlation of power data. The proposed framework is tested on the IEEE 14 bus system using real load data from New York independent system operator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only accurately recognizes the multiple bus nodes under the FDI attacks but also efficiently recovers the data injected by false data.},

abstract={The IEEE 802.15.4 standard specifies an M-ary spread spectrum system with public and fixed spreading sequences. We propose instead to use secret and dynamic, random spreading sequences to obfuscate communications. Through theory and experiments with a prototype IEEE 802.15.4 transmitter and receiver that have been adapted to use random and dynamic codes, we quantify the benefits and performance implications of our approach. We first give a theoretical approximation of the performance loss when secret random codes are used instead of the IEEE 802.15.4 codes. We identify then three transitional regions for IEEE 802.15.4 communication above thermal noise i.e., when the incoming power level at the attacker is above thermal noise. We derive the obfuscation gain for signal detection and signal interception attacks respectively in these regions. Our implementation shows the feasibility of our approach. It is also used to evaluate the performance loss and time requirements to perform attacks on the system under realistic wireless conditions.},

abstract={With the growing prevalence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there is an urgent demand to explain their behaviors. Global explanations contribute to understanding model predictions on a whole category of samples, and thus have attracted increasing interest recently. However, existing methods overwhelmingly conduct separate input attribution or rely on local approximations of models, making them fail to offer faithful global explanations of CNNs. To overcome such drawbacks, we propose a novel two-stage framework, Attacking for Interpretability (AfI), which explains model decisions in terms of the importance of user-defined concepts. AfI first conducts a feature occlusion analysis, which resembles a process of attacking models to derive the category-wide importance of different features. We then map the feature importance to concept importance through ad-hoc semantic tasks. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of AfI and its superiority in providing more accurate estimations of concept importance than existing proposals.},

pages={771-783},
abstract={As the quantity and complexity of network threats grow, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have become critical for securing networks. Achieving computer network intrusion detection with these IDSs requires high-level information technology and security expertise because malicious traffic has to be rigorously analyzed and the appropriate IDS rules written to effectively detect vulnerabilities that may potentially be exploited. However, incorrect IDS rules may produce numerous false positives, thereby degrading the performance of the IDS, and even worse, paralyzing the network. In this paper, we present a novel approach that exploits the Latent Dirichle Allocation (LDA) algorithm to generate IDS rules. Our proposed method, called LDA-based Automatic Rule Generation (LARGen), automatically performs an analysis of the malicious traffic and extracts the appropriate attack signatures that will be used for IDS rules. LARGen first extracts multiple signature strings embedded in network flows. Then, the flows are classified based on the extracted signature strings, and key content strings for malicious traffic are identified through the LDA inferential topic model. Those key content strings are the core of an IDS rule that can detect malicious traffic. We study the effectiveness of LDA in the context of network attack signature generation via extensive experiments with real network trace data, consisting of both benign and malicious traffic. Experimental results confirm that threat rules generated from LARGen accurately detect every cyber attack with high accuracy.},

abstract={Malware often act on a compromised machine with the identifier of a legitimate user. We analyzed numerous malware and user tasks, and found subtle differences between how the two operate on a machine. We have developed a machine learning approach that characterizes user tasks through their resource utilization. We have found that many routine user tasks retain their resource utilization patterns, despite the occurrence of new dynamics each time a user carries out those tasks. On the other hand, upon landing on a target machine, malware perform a substantial amount of work to explore the machine and discover resources that are of interest to threat actors. Our approach collects live performance counter data from the operating system kernel, and subsequently pre-processes and analyzes those data to learn and then recognize the resource utilization of a task. We develop decoy process mechanisms that camouflage performance counter data to prevent malware from learning the resource utilization of a user task. We tested our approach against both legitimate users in real-world work settings and malware samples, and discuss our findings in the paper.},

abstract={A service network with decentralized ownership is a system where nodes offering a variety of services are administered by different organizations -- or even by a set of individuals. In such a context, nodes hosting services can dynamically enter and exit the system without prior notice, and there is no centralized point of control. If one wants to build into such a system the ability to direct incoming requests for the various hosted services to those nodes that can efficiently fulfill them, one option is to introduce in the system an entity that serves as a gateway to accept service requests, and is an intermediary to re-direct requests as needed. That implies that this intermediary is able to acquire and maintain accurate and up-to-date information on where it can direct incoming requests. Another option, which is the one we pursue in this paper, is to build the system as an overlay network, in which the nodes hosting instances of each of many different types of services can self-organize as "virtual clusters", and efficiently load-balance incoming requests amongst themselves. We describe our design and evaluation of a decentralized computing framework of this kind. We leverage a resilient peer-to-peer overlay that automatically re-configures its topology, responding to the number of different service types executing on the peer nodes, the dynamics of the participation of those nodes (peer churn), and the traffic coming into the system for the various services.},

abstract={With the development of the neural networks, deep learning has achieved advanced performance in various tasks. In recent years, however, researchers have found that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were vulnerable to adversarial examples-adding imperceptible perturbations to the original images can cause misclassification. This paper proposes a new defense method against adversarial examples attack. Based on the defense strategy of the MagNet, we add two random layers: one is used to randomly adjust the image size and the other is used to randomly fill the image with zero to reduce the impact of adversarial attack. Our method provides the following advantages: 1)The framework does not rely on adversarial examples and its generation process. 2)The method is relatively easy and effective in practice. The experiment results show that this method not only can effectively defend the common attack but also the overall accuracy is 3% higher than MagNet.},

abstract={Machine learning has been attracting strong interests in recent years. Numerous companies have invested great efforts and resources to develop customized deep-learning models, which are their key intellectual properties. In this work, we investigate to what extent the secret of deep-learning models can be inferred by attackers. In particular, we focus on the scenario that a model developer and an adversary share the same GPU when training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. We exploit the GPU side-channel based on context-switching penalties. This side-channel allows us to extract the fine-grained structural secret of a DNN model, including its layer composition and hyper-parameters. Leveraging this side-channel, we developed an attack prototype named MosConS, which applies LSTM-based inference models to identify the structural secret. Our evaluation of MosConS shows the structural information can be accurately recovered. Therefore, we believe new defense mechanisms should be developed to protect training against the GPU side-channel.},

abstract={With the advent of 5G, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) employed in the vertical industries and critical infrastructures will depend on the cellular network more than ever; making their attack surface wider. Hence, guarding the network against cyberattacks is critical not only for its primary subscribers but to prevent it from being exploited as a proxy to attack CPSs. In this article, we propose a consolidated framework, by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and real network data, to provide early detection for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks orchestrated by a botnet that controls malicious devices. These puppet devices individually perform silent call, signaling, SMS spamming, or a blend of these attacks targeting call, Internet, SMS, or a blend of these services, respectively, to cause a collective DDoS attack in a cell that can disrupt CPSs' operations. Our results demonstrate that our framework can achieve higher than $91\%$ normal and underattack cell detection accuracy.},

Then we cluster such pairs as a graph visualizing an attack path. The attack is finally detected based on the graph size. Since this approach is agnostic to specific signatures, it can cope with a wide variety of attacks.

abstract={Smartphones and mobile devices are rapidly becoming indispensable devices for many users. Unfortunately, they also become fertile grounds for hackers to deploy malware. There is an urgent need to have a "security analytic & forensic system" which can facilitate analysts to examine, dissect, associate and correlate large number of mobile applications. An effective analytic system needs to address the following questions: How to automatically collect and manage a high volume of mobile malware? How to analyze a zero-day suspicious application, and compare or associate it with existing malware families in the database? How to reveal similar malicious logic in various malware, and to quickly identify the new malicious code segment? In this paper, we present the design and implementation of DroidAnalytics, a signature based analytic system to automatically collect, manage, analyze and extract android malware. The system facilitates analysts to retrieve, associate and reveal malicious logics at the "opcode level". We demonstrate the efficacy of DroidAnalytics using 150, 368 Android applications, and successfully determine 2, 475 Android malware from 102 different families, with 327 of them being zero-day malware samples from six different families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in showing such a large Android malware analysis/detection. The evaluation shows the DroidAnalytics is a valuable tool and is effective in analyzing malware repackaging and mutations.},

abstract={Relieving users from the burden of remembering and inputting authentication information explicitly, such as passwords/PINs and lock patterns, implicit authentication mechanisms have gained an increasing concern. When providing authentication, the existing implicit methods only depend on a specific behavior, such as typing on the screen, performing gestures, or taking a walk. However, in real applications, a user's behavioral characteristics are also decided by the context where behavior is performed. Thus, those existing methods show limited authentication accuracy and usability. To address these issues, we propose CaIAuth, a reliable context-aware implicit authentication framework, which profiles users' behavior and context characteristics in a holistic fashion. It observes the states of context-sensing entities for different smartphone usage patterns and builds a context-aware model to distinguish between legitimate users and illegal ones. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate system performance with a large data set collected from 142 subjects. The experimental results show that our system achieves a low equal error rate (EER) (e.g., less 7%) and is resilient against common threats, including zero-effect attack and mimicry attack. In addition, CaIAuth achieves a low authentication delay and overhead.},

Compared with the existing FDIAs, where no contingency analysis is considered for attack targets, we present a new attack strategy with which the adversary stealthily drops or adds contingency pairs of transmission line flows from or to a normal contingency list by misleading the CA process through injecting false data into SE. The manipulated contingency pairs are then embedded as security constraints into operating constraints of security-constrained economic dispatch. As a result, the proposed attacks lead to the miscalculation of locational marginal price (LMP) in real-time power markets. The capability and economic impact of the proposed attack, such as a list of manipulated contingency line pairs, attack effort, and LMP deviation from normal price, are illustrated in the IEEE 14-bus system.},

In addition, our network jointly predicts optical flow as an auxiliary task by measuring photometric consistency in a self-supervised way to help the encoder for better motion feature extraction. In order to alleviate the effects of non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamical objects in the scene, a confidence mask layer is estimated and epipolar constraint is added to the training process. Experiment results indicate competitive performance of the proposed framework to the state-of-art methods.},

abstract={Blockchain technology’s (BT) Ethereum Smart Contracts [1] allows programmable transactions that involve the transfer of monetary assets among peers on a BT network independent of a central authorizing agency. Ethereum Smart Contracts are programs that are deployed as decentralized applications, having the building blocks of the blockchain consensus protocol. This technology enables consumers to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment. However, the security vulnerabilities within these smart contracts are a potential threat to the applications and their consumers and have shown in the past to cause huge financial losses. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to an unexpected revert in Ethereum Smart Contracts. Our framework, SmartScan, statically scans smart contracts under test (SCUTs) to identify patterns that are potentially vulnerable in these SCUTs and then uses dynamic analysis to precisely confirm their exploitability of the DoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and more precise results. We evaluated SmartScan on a set of 500 smart contracts collected from the Etherscan [2]. Our approach shows an improvement in precision and recall when compared to available state of the art techniques.},

abstract={It is generally believed that neural network classifiers are vulnerable to misclassification attacks. An adversary generates adversarial samples by adding small perturbations to the original samples. These adversarial samples will mislead classifiers, although they are almost the same as the original samples from the perspective of human observation. However, the existing misclassification attacks need either the details of classifier or a fake classifier to craft the adversarial samples. One may think a black box classifier is robust enough against misclassification attacks. We demonstrate that black box classifier is still vulnerable to our proposed misclassification attack. We conceal the details of classifier. The only thing an adversary can do is to query samples' classification results. We proposed a particle swarm optimization based misclassification attack. Using this attack an adversary can make black box classifiers yield erroneous results. The experiments show that LeNet and GoogLeNet are vulnerable to our proposed attack. The misclassification rate on MNIST and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 dataset are 99.1% and 98.4%. Finally, we give some defense strategies against misclassification attacks.},

abstract={Fingertip detection plays an important role in human computer interaction. Previous works transform binocular images into depth images. Then depth-based hand pose estimation methods are used to predict 3D positions of fingertips. Different from previous works, we propose a new framework, named Two-Stream Binocular Network (TSBnet) to detect fingertips from binocular images directly. TSBnet first shares convolutional layers for low level features of right and left images. Then it extracts high level features in two-stream convolutional networks separately. Further, we add a new layer: binocular distance measurement layer to improve performance of our model. To verify our scheme, we build a binocular hand image dataset, containing about 117k pairs of images in training set and 10k pairs of images in test set. Our methods achieve an average error of 10.9mm on our test set, outperforming previous work by 5.9mm (relatively 35.1%).},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of finding the most synchrony vulnerable node in complex networks, i.e. the node which removal has the maximum influence on synchronizability of the network. In large-scale networks, brute search techniques are often not computationally cost effective in identifying the most vulnerable node(s). Here, considering the eigenratio of the Laplacian matrix of a graph as the synchronizability metric, we propose a measure in order to approximately rank nodes based on their impact on the synchronizability. This metric is cost effective since it needs a single eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix of the connection graph. Simulation results show that the proposed metric is accurate enough in predicting the most vulnerable node in synthetic networks with scale-free, Watts-Strogatz and Erdös-Rényi structures.},

abstract={Securing the physical components of a city's interdependent critical infrastructure (ICI), such as power, natural gas, and water systems is a challenging task due to their interdependence and a large number of involved sensors. In this article, using a novel integrated state-space model that captures the interdependence, a two-stage cyberattack on an ICI is studied in which the attacker first compromises the ICI's sensors by decoding their messages, and, subsequently, it alters the compromised sensors' data to cause state estimation errors. To thwart such attacks, the administrator of each critical infrastructure (CI) must assign protection levels to the sensors based on their importance in the state estimation process. To capture the interdependence between the attacker and the ICI administrator's actions and analyze their interactions, a Colonel Blotto game framework is proposed. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of this game is derived analytically. At this equilibrium, it is shown that the administrator can strategically randomize between the protection levels of the sensors to deceive the attacker. Simulation results coupled with theoretical analysis show that using the proposed game, the administrator can reduce the state estimation error by at least 50% compared to a nonstrategic approach that assigns protection levels proportional to sensor values.},

abstract={The security is a critical issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A complex form of Denial of Service attack type is collaborative black hole attacks which challenge the security of wireless sensor networks. The purpose of this attack is to receive and drop all packets. Wireless sensor network nodes have limited energy and also have limited processing capability. WSNs devices have limited resources and they are particularly susceptible to the destruction and consumption of these limited resources. Collaborative black hole attacks are effective to partition the networks so the important data do not reach to base station. To secure wireless sensor network from collaborative black hole attacks, many security techniques have been proposed, most of them are energy inefficient and complex. In this paper, we discuss various techniques which detect and prevent the collaborative black hole attacks in WSNs and proposed a cluster-based energy preserving detection model of WSNs security against collaborative black hole attacks.},

abstract={The robustness and vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are quickly becoming a critical area of interest since these models are in widespread use across real-world applications (i.e., image and audio analysis, recommendation system, natural language analysis, etc.). A DNN's vulnerability is exploited by an adversary to generate data to attack the model; however, the majority of adversarial data generators have focused on image domains with far fewer work on audio domains. More recently, audio analysis models were shown to be vulnerable to adversarial audio examples (e.g., speech command classification, automatic speech recognition, etc.). Thus, one urgent open problem is to detect adversarial audio reliably. In this contribution, we incorporate a separate and yet related DNN technique to detect adversarial audio, namely model quantization. Then we propose an algorithm to detect adversarial audio by using a DNN's quantization error. Specifically, we demonstrate that adversarial audio typically exhibits a larger activation quantization error than benign audio. The quantization error is measured using character error rates. We use the difference in errors to discriminate adversarial audio. Experiments with three the-state-of-the-art audio attack algorithms against the DeepSpeech model show our detection algorithm achieved high accuracy on the Mozilla dataset.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the correlation of graph da-ta's anonymity, utility, and de-anonymity. Our main contributions include four perspectives. First, to the best of our knowledge, we conduct the first Anonymity-Utility-De-anonymity (AUD) correlation quantification for graph data and obtain close-forms for such correlation under both a preliminary mathematical model and a general data model. Second, we integrate our AUD quantification to SecGraph [31], a recently published Secure Graph data sharing/publishing system, and extend it to Sec-Graph+. Compared to SecGraph, SecGraph+ is an improved and enhanced uniform and open-source system for comprehensively studying graph anonymization, de-anonymization, and utility evaluation. Third, based on our AUD quantification, we evaluate the anonymity, utility, and de-anonymity of 12 real world graph datasets which are generated from various computer systems and services. The results show that the achievable anonymity/de-anonymity depends on multiple factors, e.g., the preserved data utility, the quality of the employed auxiliary data. Finally, we apply our AUD quantification to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art anonymization and de-anonymization techniques. Interestingly, we find that there is still significant space to improve state-of-the-art de-anonymization attacks. We also explicitly and quantitatively demonstrate such possible improvement space.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a technology capable of connecting heterogeneous nodes/objects, such as people, devices, infrastructure, and makes our daily lives simpler, safer, and fruitful. Being part of a large network of heterogeneous devices, these nodes are typically resource-constrained and became the weakest link to the cyber attacker. Classical encryption techniques have been employed to ensure the data security of the IoT network. However, high-level encryption techniques cannot be employed in IoT devices due to the limitation of resources. In addition, node security is still a challenge for network engineers. Thus, we need to explore a complete solution for IoT networks that can ensure nodes and data security. The rule-based approaches and shallow and deep machine learning algorithms– branches of Artificial Intelligence (AI)– can be employed as countermeasures along with the existing network security protocols. This paper presented a comprehensive layer-wise survey on IoT security threats, and the AI-based security models to impede security threats. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are addressed for the safeguard of the IoT network.},

In addition, little is known about crime-as-a-service (CaaS), a criminal business model that underpins the cybercrime underground. This research gap and the practical cybercrime problems we face have motivated us to investigate the cybercrime underground economy by taking a data analytics approach from a design science perspective. To achieve this goal, we: (1) propose a data analysis framework for analyzing the cybercrime underground; (2) propose CaaS and crimeware definitions; (3) propose an associated classification model, and (4) develop an example application to demonstrate how the proposed framework and classification model could be implemented in practice. We then use this application to investigate the cybercrime underground economy by analyzing a large data set obtained from the online hacking community. By taking a design science research approach, this paper contributes to the design artifacts, foundations, and methodologies in this area. Moreover, it provides useful practical insights to practitioners by suggesting guidelines as to how governments and organizations in all industries can prepare for attacks by the cybercrime underground.},

abstract={Transformer taps are used extensively to regulate bus voltages in transmission networks. Tap change commands relayed through the SCADA network are attractive targets for falsification by attackers in order to adversely affect the operation of the system. Such attacks can be hidden by selective measurement manipulations. In this paper, an algorithm is developed that detects the presence of a stealthy false tap change command. The development of the algorithm is based on the intuition that any attack involving injection of false data or commands can only influence the measurement and estimation of certain selected variables, not all of them. The algorithm is based on the ratios of injection or branch currents to the voltages of the terminal nodes of the tap changing transformers. This principle is proven analytically and validated using simulations, leading to the establishment of an index which distinguishes stealthy attacks from normal operation scenarios. This lead to the development of an algorithm which is simple to implement, computationally light and shown to be extremely reliable when tested across various cases on the IEEE 118-bus and 2383-bus Polish systems.},

abstract={Controlling a device with a brain-computer interface requires extraction of relevant and robust features from high-dimensional electroencephalographic recordings. Spatial filtering is a crucial step in this feature extraction process. This paper reviews algorithms for spatial filter computation and introduces a general framework for this task based on divergence maximization. We show that the popular common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm can be formulated as a divergence maximization problem and computed within our framework. Our approach easily permits enforcing different invariances and utilizing information from other subjects; thus, it unifies many of the recently proposed CSP variants in a principled manner. Furthermore, it allows to design novel spatial filtering algorithms by incorporating regularization schemes into the optimization process or applying other divergences. We evaluate the proposed approach using three regularization schemes, investigate the advantages of beta divergence, and show that subject-independent feature spaces can be extracted by jointly optimizing the divergence problems of multiple users. We discuss the relations to several CSP variants and investigate the advantages and limitations of our approach with simulations. Finally, we provide experimental results on a dataset containing recordings from 80 subjects and interpret the obtained patterns from a neurophysiological perspective.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting and tracking vehicles to the rear and in the blind zone of a vehicle, using a single rear-mounted fisheye camera and multiple detection algorithms. A maneuver that is a significant cause of accidents involves a target vehicle approaching the host vehicle from the rear and overtaking into the adjacent lane. As the overtaking vehicle moves toward the edge of the image and into the blind zone, the view of the vehicle gradually changes from a front view to a side view. Furthermore, the effects of fisheye distortion are at their most pronounced toward the extremities of the image, rendering detection of a target vehicle entering the blind zone even more difficult. The proposed system employs an AdaBoost classifier at distances of 10-40 m between the host and target vehicles. For detection at short distances where the view of a target vehicle has changed to a side view and the AdaBoost classifier is less effective, identification of vehicle wheels is proposed. Two methods of wheel detection are employed: at distances between 5 and 15 m, a novel algorithm entitled wheel arch contour detection (WACD) is presented, and for distances less than 5 m, Hough circle detection provides reliable wheel detection. A testing framework is also presented, which categorizes detection performance as a function of distance between host and target vehicles. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method results in a detection rate of greater than 93% in the critical range (blind zone) of the host.},

abstract={A recent report indicates that there is a new malicious app introduced every 4 seconds. This rapid malware distribution rate causes existing malware detection systems to fall far behind, allowing malicious apps to escape vetting efforts and be distributed by even legitimate app stores. When trusted downloading sites distribute malware, several negative consequences ensue. First, the popularity of these sites would allow such malicious apps to quickly and widely infect devices. Second, analysts and researchers who rely on machine learning based detection techniques may also download these apps and mistakenly label them as benign since they have not been disclosed as malware. These apps are then used as part of their benign dataset during model training and testing. The presence of contaminants in benign dataset can compromise the effectiveness and accuracy of their detection and classification techniques. To address this issue, we introduce PUDROID (Positive and Unlabeled learning-based malware detection for Android) to automatically and effectively remove contaminants from training datasets, allowing machine learning based malware classifiers and detectors to be more effective and accurate. To further improve the performance of such detectors, we apply a feature selection strategy to select pertinent features from a variety of features. We then compare the detection rates and accuracy of detection systems using two datasets; one using PUDROID to remove contaminants and the other without removing contaminants. The results indicate that once we remove contaminants from the datasets, we can significantly improve both malware detection rate and detection accuracy.},

abstract={Traffic analysis is very much essential in many network monitoring/surveillance and middle box appliances installed at the perimeter of the internal and the external network. Internet Service Providers are also required to do traffic analysis for the purpose of providing the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters as mentioned in the Service Level Agreement. A lot of research is being done in the field of traffic analysis based on the machine learning (ML) based approaches. The main factor in ML based approaches is the selection of the features which can uniquely determine and thus classify the traffic flows. In this paper, website fingerprinting (WF) for a particular browser and WF for different browsers has been carried out. The analysis is carried out on encrypted traffic flows, i.e., those using Secure Socket layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The feature extraction phase includes a feature set which are uncorrelated and combines the statistical parameters of a traffic flow as well as information extracted from the meta-data of the encrypted traffic flows. The feature extraction phase is thus the critical step in the later classification strategy for WF. The classification involves machine learning algorithms and for that we have utilized a machine learning tool to automate the process. After training the classifier, the testing and validating shows that the features used for the classification process are indeed very useful in distinguishing the various encrypted web traffic flows captured from visiting various websites and also through the use of different browsers.},

However, recently emerged symbol-level precoding techniques can constructively exploit the MUI by transforming it into useful signal at the receiver and contribute to symbol detection. This paper adopts this concept and aims to investigate the exploitation of the MUI to enhance both physical layer security against eavesdropping and the quality of legitimate transmissions. Particularly, we consider the problem of secure symbol-level precoding in multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) wiretap systems. Our goal is to design the symbol-level precoder to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of all legitimate transmissions as well as ensure security against eavesdropping. The symbol-level precoder algorithms for physical layer security are developed under different assumptions about the availability of channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate and eavesdropping channels. Extensive simulation results validate the exploitation of MUI for security and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed secure symbol-level precoding algorithms.},

abstract={Face recognition systems have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial faces resulting from adding small perturbations to probe images. Such adversarial images can lead state-of-the-art face matchers to falsely reject a genuine subject (obfuscation attack) or falsely match to an impostor (impersonation attack). Current approaches to crafting adversarial faces lack perceptual quality and take an unreasonable amount of time to generate them. We propose, AdvFaces, an automated adversarial face synthesis method that learns to generate minimal perturbations in the salient facial regions via Generative Adversarial Networks. Once AdvFaces is trained, a hacker can automatically generate imperceptible face perturbations that can evade four black-box state-of-the-art face matchers with attack success rates as high as 97.22% and 24.30% at 0.1 % False Accept Rate, for obfuscation and impersonation attacks, respectively.},

abstract={The recent advancements in hardware miniaturization capabilities have boosted the diffusion of systems based on Energy Harvesting (EH) technologies, as a means to power embedded wireless devices in a sustainable and low-cost fashion. Despite the undeniable management advantages, the intermittent availability of the energy source and the limited power supply has led to challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In this paper, we survey the security issues, applications, techniques, and challenges arising in wireless networks powered via EH technologies. We explore the vulnerabilities of EH networks, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific literature, including attack vectors, cryptography techniques, physical-layer security schemes for data secrecy, and additional physical-layer countermeasures. For each of the identified macro-areas, we compare the scientific contributions across a range of shared features, indicating the pros and cons of the described techniques, the research challenges, and a few future directions. Finally, we also provide an overview of the emerging topics in the area, such as Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) schemes, and Intelligent Reconfigurable Surfaces, that could trigger the interest of industry and academia and unleash the full potential of pervasive EH wireless networks.},

abstract={Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has evolved to measure and control energy usage in communicating through metering devices. However, the development of the AMI network brings with it security issues, including the increasingly serious risk of malware in the new emerging network. Malware is often embedded in the data payloads of legitimate metering data. It is difficult to detect malware in metering devices, which are resource constrained embedded systems, during time-critical communications. This paper describes a method in order to distinguish malware-bearing traffic and legitimate metering data using a disassembler and statistical analysis. Based on the discovered unique characteristic of each data type, the proposed method detects malicious metering data. (i.e. malware-bearing data). The analysis of data payloads is statistically performed while investigating a distribution of instructions in traffic by using a disassembler. Doing so demonstrates that the distribution of instructions in metering data is significantly different from that in malware-bearing data. The proposed approach successfully identifies the two different types of data with complete accuracy, with 0% false positives and 0% false negatives.},

abstract={The secure separation of functionality is one of the key requirements particularly in mixed criticality systems (MCS). Well-known security models as the multiple independent levels of security (MILS) aim to formalise the isolation of compartments to avoid interference and make them reliable to work in safety critical environments. Especially for in-car multimedia systems, also known as In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems, the composition of compartments onto a system-on-chip (SoC) offers a wide variety of advantages in embedded system development. The development of such systems implies often the combination of pre-qualified hardware- and software components. These components are CPU subsystems and operating systems, for example. However, the required strict separation can suffer due to the pre-qualified and therefore not reconfigurable hardware components. Particularly, this is true for shared cache levels in CPU subsystems. The phenomena of interference in the concurrent usage of shared last-level caches, are exploitable by adversaries. Therefore, this article identifies the attack surface and proposes a mitigation to prevent from the intentional misuse of the fixed cache association. Generally, the solution is based on a suitable mapping scheme in the intermediate address space of an asymmetric multiprocessing environment which implements the MCS. Furthermore, we evaluate the strength of the approach and show how the solution contributes to a separation property conformal system.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet, the network structure becomes larger and more complicated and attacking methods are more sophisticated, too. To enhance network security, Network Security Situation Analysis (NSSA) technology is a research hot spot in the network security domain. But at present, the NSSA framework and model which not only analyze the affected results of the network security but also the process how the network security is affected are less. In this paper, a novel NSSA framework is presented. The framework includes two parts: calculate the Network Security Situation Value (NSSV) and discover intrusion processes. NSSA quantitative assesses the impact on network security caused by attacks upon Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and hierarchical network structure. Based on attack classification, intrusion processes discover the process how network security is affected. At last from the experiments results, NSSV exactly changes as attacks take place and the accurate intrusion processes are discovered. The applicability of the framework and algorithms are verified.},

abstract={Overvoltages are the main causes of damages and accidents in electric power grids. The traditional approach is to install some static protection devices that are passive and cannot identify the overvoltage types or locate where the overvoltage event occurs. In recent years, with the development of smart grids, some online overvoltage monitoring systems have been developed. However, the approaches to data processing still need further development. A novel technique for identification and location of overvoltages in power distribution systems is proposed, which uses capacitor bank energization overvoltages (CBOVs) and ground fault temporary overvoltages (TOVs) as the study cases. The wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) theory is used for frequency band decomposition, and a general regression neural network (GRNN) is used in identification and location. Simulation results based on real-world power distribution systems show that the method is accurate and fast.},

abstract={As Web bot technologies continue to evolve, the task of separating human Web sessions from those generated by malicious bots becomes increasingly more challenging. To date, many research studies have proposed the use of advanced ML-based methods as automated means of differentiating between Web bot and genuine human sessions. Unfortunately, most of these studies overlook the importance of adequate feature selection during the dataset preprocessing stage. Namely, instead of making the process of feature selection automated and optimized to each particular dataset, these studies generally resort to the use of the same fixed set of hand-picked Web-session attributes. It is well known, however, that suboptimal approach to feature selection is likely to result in suboptimal performance of the respective ML algorithm and, consequently, of the entire system. The main contributions of our work are as follows: First, we propose the use of Gradient Boosting Technique to automatically identify the most significant Web-session features (out of an extensive list of 119 possible attributes) for any given dataset. Second, we integrate this automated features selection technique into a system for Web-session classification based on the unsupervised Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm. Third, we validate the performance of the integrated system on a recent real-world dataset which has been collected during a confirmed large-scale attack on our home institution. The obtained experimental results not only verify that our proposed system is highly effective in identifying malicious Web-sessions, but they also help us better understand the nature and scale of the conducted attack itself.},

abstract={This work uses adversarial perturbations to enhance deepfake images and fool common deepfake detectors. We created adversarial perturbations using the Fast Gradient Sign Method and the Carlini and Wagner L2 norm attack in both blackbox and whitebox settings. Detectors achieved over 95% accuracy on unperturbed deepfakes, but less than 27% accuracy on perturbed deepfakes. We also explore two improvements to deep-fake detectors: (i) Lipschitz regularization, and (ii) Deep Image Prior (DIP). Lipschitz regularization constrains the gradient of the detector with respect to the input in order to increase robustness to input perturbations. The DIP defense removes perturbations using generative convolutional neural networks in an unsupervised manner. Regularization improved the detection of perturbed deepfakes on average, including a 10% accuracy boost in the blackbox case. The DIP defense achieved 95% accuracy on perturbed deepfakes that fooled the original detector while retaining 98% accuracy in other cases on a 100 image subsample.},

abstract={The accurate detection of attacks in ad hoc computer networks is made significantly more difficult if the components of the attack sequence are distributed throughout the network data stream. Since current approaches to detecting network intrusions rely on associating individual network actions the temporal distribution of an attack throughout a network makes it extremely difficult to accurately identify the intrusion. This paper describes an approach to detecting temporally distributed attacks based on a modified Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM). The HQSOM approach emulates some aspects of biological neural networks by distributing the reasoning capability throughout a hierarchical structure. The approach described here combines an adaptive learning parameter with variable spatial and temporal clustering to associate the components of the attack. The results of the evaluation of the approach and opportunities for additional research are also described.},

abstract={Distributed storage system has been widely used currently. Compared with traditional NAS and SAN storage, distributed storage system has obvious advantages in terms of cost, performance and security. The security of distributed storage system is mainly reflected in the data redundancy level. However, if there are security risks in the operating system and network environment, the security of the data still cannot be guaranteed. How to fundamentally solve the security risks of distributed storage system is an urgent problem. Based on the theory of mimic defense, Storage Architecture for Mimic Defense(SAMD) is put forward in this paper. In the proposed SAMD, dynamic heterogeneous redundancy function is introduced into distributed storage system. During the process of data reading and writing, the execution results are obtained from dynamic heterogeneous executive units, and the processing and judgement are carried out according to the customized strategy. It then dynamically allocates the executive units and storage nodes to achieve the effect of active defense.},

Unfortunately, this model fails to incorporate insights regarding online offenders' traits and the conditions surrounding the development of online criminal event. Drawing on contemporary criminological models, we present a theoretical rationale for revising the SKRAM model. The revised model suggests that in addition to the classical SKRAM components, both individual attributes and certain offline and online circumstances fuel cyber attackers' motivation to offend, and increase the probability that a cyber-attack will be launched against an organization. Consistent with our proposed model, and its potential in predicting the occurrence of different types of cyber-dependent crimes against organizations, we propose that Information Technology professionals' efforts to facilitate safe computing environments should design new approaches for collecting indicators regarding attackers' potential threat, and predicting the occurrence and timing of cyber-dependent crimes.},

abstract={In Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, attackers who can intrude into an organization network tend to stay inside the network or repeat intrusion multiple times until they are able to accomplish their goals. When Active Directory(AD), a centralization management system for Windows computers, is in place, attackers try to disguise themselves as users of legitimate Domain Administrator accounts, which is the highest privileged account of the AD environment. Activities on the Windows system are recorded in the built-in Windows activity logging system called the Event logs and is commonly used for investigation of attacks. However, if attackers leverage legitimate accounts or built-in Windows tools in order to avoid detection, it is quite difficult to detect attacks from Event logs since attackers' activities are recorded as activities of legitimate administrator accounts. Although there are various antivirus software, detecting such a sophisticated attack is often very difficult. In this research, we focus on processing attack activity data recorded in the Event logs, and propose a new method based on outlier detection and machine learning for detecting attacks that utilize legitimate accounts. We achieved a high precision rate even if legitimate Domain Administrator accounts are leveraged in attacks.},

abstract={Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaics (PVs), energy storage systems (ESSs), local loads, and demand response (DR) are highly valued for environmental protection. However, their volatility poses several risks to the DER aggregator while formulating a profitable strategy for bidding in the day-ahead power market. This study proposes a data-driven bidding strategy framework for a DER aggregator confronted with various uncertainties. First, a data-driven forecasting model involving gated recurrent unit–enhanced learning particle swarm optimization (GRU-ELPSO) with improved mutual information (IMI) is employed to model renewables and local loads. It is critical for a DER aggregator to accurately estimate these components before bidding in the day-ahead power market. This aids in reducing the penalty costs of forecasting errors. Second, an optimal bidding strategy that is based on the information gap decision theory (IGDT) is formulated to address market price uncertainty. The DER aggregator is assumed to be risk-averse (RA) or risk-seeker (RS), and the corresponding bidding strategies are formulated according to the risk preferences thereof. Then, an hourly bidding profile is created for the DER aggregator to bid successfully in the day-ahead power market. The proposed data-driven bidding framework is evaluated using an illustrative system wherein a dataset is obtained from the PJM market. The results reveal the effectiveness of handling uncertainty by providing accurate forecasting results. In addition, the DER aggregator can bid effectively in the day-ahead power market according to its preference for robustness or high profit, with a suitable bidding profile.},

abstract={Drive-by download attacks attempt to compromise a victim's computer through browser vulnerabilities. Often they are launched from Malware Distribution Networks (MDNs) consisting of landing pages to attract traffic, intermediate redirection servers, and exploit servers which attempt the compromise. In this paper, we present a novel approach to discovering the landing pages that lead to drive-by downloads. Starting from partial knowledge of a given collection of MDNs we identify the malicious content on their landing pages using multiclass feature selection. We then query the webpage cache of a commercial search engine to identify landing pages containing the same or similar content. In this way we are able to identify previously unknown landing pages belonging to already identified MDNs, which allows us to expand our understanding of the MDN. We explore using both a rule-based and classifier approach to identifying potentially malicious landing pages. We build both systems and independently verify using a high-interaction honeypot that the newly identified landing pages indeed attempt drive-by downloads. For the rule-based system 57% of the landing pages predicted as malicious are confirmed, and this success rate remains constant in two large trials spaced five months apart. This extends the known footprint of the MDNs studied by 17%. The classifier-based system is less successful, and we explore possible reasons.},

abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) has been widely used in many application scenarios, but it is easy to be affected by slight disturbance, which is referred to as adversarial examples, and produces wrong decisions endangering system security. It is difficult to obtain the structure and parameter information of the target network in the actual scene. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based method to generate adversarial examples. Inspired by the autoencoder and Conditional Generative Adversarial Net (CGAN), we train the encoder to encode the image into latent vector, of which the specific region (category field) is used to represent the category information of the image, and then train the decoder to generate adversarial examples of the specified category. We perform Natural Evolution Strategy in the low-dimensional latent space to further improve the attack. The result shows that our method can successfully attack the target network within only one or a few queries. We evaluate our method on Sign-Language-Digits (SLD) and Cifar-10 datasets. Compared with other methods, our approach can attack the target model with less queries, and maintain a high success rate.},

abstract={Data outsourcing relieves cloud users of the heavy burden of infrastructure management and maintenance. However, the handover of data control to untrusted cloud servers significantly complicates the security issues. Conventional signature verification widely adopted in cryptographic storage system only guarantees the integrity of retrieved data, for those rarely or never accessed data, it does not work. This paper integrates proof of storage technique with data dynamics support into cryptographic storage design to provide full integrity for outsourced data. Besides, we provide instantaneously freshness check for retrieved data to defend against potential replay attacks. We achieve these goals by designing flexible block structures and combining broadcast encryption, key regression, Merkle hash tree, proof of storage and fine-grained access control policies together to provide a secure storage service for outsourced data. Experimental evaluation of our prototype shows that the cryptographic cost and throughput is reasonable and acceptable.},

abstract={Face alignment consists of aligning a shape model on a face image. It is an active domain in computer vision as it is a preprocessing for a number of face analysis and synthesis applications. Current state-of-the-art methods already perform well on “easy” datasets, with moderate head pose variations, but may not be robust for “in-the-wild” data with poses up to 90°. In order to increase robustness to an ensemble of factors of variations (e.g., head pose or occlusions), a given layer (e.g., a regressor or an upstream CNN layer) can be replaced by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer that uses an ensemble of experts instead of a single one. The weights of this mixture can be learned as gating functions to jointly learn the experts and the corresponding weights. In this paper, we propose to use tree-structured gates which allows a hierarchical weighting of the experts (Tree-MoE). We investigate the use of Tree-MoE layers in different contexts in the frame of face alignment with cascaded regression, firstly for emphasizing relevant, more specialized feature extractors depending of a high-level semantic information such as head pose (Pose-Tree-MoE), and secondly as an overall more robust regression layer. We perform extensive experiments on several challenging face alignment datasets, demonstrating that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Future 5G systems are envisioned to support wide range of applications, from narrowband to broadband, by occupying non contiguous spectrum bands from lower sub-6GHz bands to higher millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. In this regard, significant challenges in design and implementation of 5G radio have to be addressed both in uplink and downlink. One of the challenges is related to the consideration of enabling physical layer (PHY) in the deployment of robust transmission systems able at striking an efficient tradeoff between power and spectral resources through the use of advanced MIMO-multicarrier techniques. In this paper, we address such challenge by proposing a novel technique based on space-time shift keying (STSK)-aided constant envelope orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CE-OFDM) over frequency-selective mmWave channels. The main idea is to blend the benefits of STSK and CE-OFDM in mmWave transmissions by keeping complexity of the system as lowest as possible. We show that the STSK-CE-OFDM outperforms the state-of-the-art STSK-OFDM comprehensively in the presence of nonideal power amplifier. In particular, STSK-CE-OFDM can achieve a very large performance gain over the STSK-OFDM counterpart in the presence of nonlinear amplification. For this reason, STSK-CE-OFDM can strike a favorable and flexible tradeoff between power and spectral efficiency in the framework of 5G mmWave wireless communications. The price to be paid is an overall bandwidth increase with respect to conventional STSK-OFDM, due to the need of modulation indexes higher than 1.0 radians.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={571-580},
abstract={Graph embedding has shown its effectiveness to represent graph information and capture deep relationships in graph data. Most recent graph embedding methods focus on attributed graphs, since they preserve both structure and content information in the network. However, corruption can exist in the graph structure as well as the node content of the graph, and both can lead to inferior embedding results. Unfortunately, few existing graph embedding algorithms have considered the corruption problem, and to the best of our knowledge, none has studied structural corruption in attributed graphs, including missing and redundant edges. This field is difficult for previous methods, mainly due to two challenges: (1) the existence of various corruption causes has made it difficult to recognize corruptions in graphs, and (2) the complexity of graph-structured data has increased the difficulty of handling corruption therein for graph embedding methods. These facts lead us here to propose a novel autoencoder-based graph embedding approach, which is robust against structural corruption. Our idea comes from the recent discovery of memorization effects in deep learning. Namely, deep neural networks prefer to fit clean data first, before they over-fit corrupted data. Specifically, we train two autoencoders simultaneously and let them learn the reliability of the edges in the graph from each other. The two autoencoders would evaluate the edges according to their reconstructed structure and manipulate this by devaluing those distrusted edges to update the structure information. The updated structure would be used further in the next iteration as the ground-truth of its peer-network. Experiments on different versions of real-world graphs show state-of-the-art results and demonstrate the robustness of our model against structural corruption.},

abstract={Although the dramatic increase in Online Social Network (OSN) usage, there are still a lot of security and privacy concerns. In such a scenario, it would be very beneficial to have a mechanism able to assign a risk score to each OSN user. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a risk assessment based on the idea that the more a user behavior diverges from what it can be considered as a `normal behavior', the more it should be considered risky. In doing this, we have taken into account that OSN population is really heterogeneous in observed behaviors. As such, it is not possible to define a unique standard behavioral model that fits all OSN users' behaviors. However, we expect that similar people tend to follow similar rules with the results of similar behavioral models. For this reason, we propose a risk assessment approach organized into two phases: similar users are first grouped together, then, for each identified group, we build one or more models for normal behavior. The carried out experiments on a real Facebook dataset show that the proposed model outperforms a simplified behavioral-based risk assessment where behavioral models are built over the whole OSN population, without a group identification phase.},

year={2020},
volume={67},

pages={4904-4917},
abstract={Signal hiding countermeasures have been extensively investigated in the early side-channel attacks' literature. Due to design and physical imperfections, their stand-alone use only leads to a limited reduction of the attacks' complexity. As a result, more algorithmic countermeasures providing a more formal cost vs. security tradeoff (e.g., shuffling and masking) have gained more attention. Yet, since the cost associated with these is high, designers aim at combining countermeasures, leveraging the strength of each. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that by asking less to both signal hiding and algorithmic countermeasures (as stand-alone), we can develop combined countermeasures that indeed provide higher security at lower cost. For this purpose, we show how we can stack signal reduction and amplitude randomization techniques with ultra low cost automatic design flows and standard tools, and reach attractive security levels in combination with masking. Concretely, we examine two natural strategies for signal hiding and their combination: namely WDDL and a simple, local, scalable and easy-to-implement noise generation engine. A 65nm technology ASIC is evaluated with multiple isolated AES cores, leveraging recent information theoretic bounds which are connected to masking security proofs, significantly reducing the side-channel information leakage. We further quantify performance gains for masked designs.},

To improve the security of THE basic network, researchers have proposed solutions from different perspectives, such as firewall based on management policy, intrusion detection system, and vulnerability scanner. However, the existing solutions cannot meet the requirements of attack intention prediction. In this paper, a construction and prediction algorithm based on the network attack path is proposed to mitigate the threats of attackers. The proposed algorithm adopts analysis integration results generated by the device of network security deployment to predict the objects of probabilistic attack targets. Based on the prediction results, the attack path is demonstrated, which provides assistant decision-making suggestions for network users. To evaluate the effectiveness, the prototype of the proposed algorithm is implemented and deployed into the actual sensor network.

year={2019},
volume={14},

abstract={Combined with many different attack forms, advanced persistent threats (APTs) are becoming a major threat to cyber security. Existing security protection works typically either focus on one-shot case, or separate detection from response decisions. Such practices lead to tractable analysis, but miss key inherent APTs persistence and risk heterogeneity. To this end, we propose a Lyapunov-based security-aware defense mechanism backed by threat intelligence, where robust defense strategy-making is based on acquired heterogeneity knowledge. By exploring temporal evolution of risk level, we introduce priority-aware virtual queues, which together with attack queues, enable security-aware response among hosts. Specifically, a long-term time average profit maximization problem is formulated. We first develop risk admission control policy to accommodate hosts' risk tolerance and response capacity. Under multiple attacker resources, defense control policy is implemented on two-stage decisions, involving proportional fair resource allocation and host-attack assignment. In particular, distributed auction-based assignment algorithm is designed to capture uncertainty in the number of resolved attacks, where high-risk host-attack pairs are prioritized over others. We theoretically prove our mechanism can guarantee bounded queue backlogs, profit optimality, no underflow condition, and robustness to detection errors. Simulations on real-world data set corroborate theoretical analysis and reveal the importance of security awareness.},

abstract={We present a novel deep neural model for text detection in document images. For robust text detection in noisy scanned documents, the advantages of multi-task learning are adopted by adding an auxiliary task of text enhancement. Namely, our proposed model is designed to perform noise reduction and text region enhancement as well as text detection. Moreover, we enrich the training data for the model with synthesized document images that are fully labeled for text detection and enhancement, thus overcome the insufficiency of labeled document image data. For the effective exploitation of the synthetic and real data, the training process is separated in two phases. The first phase is training only synthetic data in a fully-supervised manner. Then real data with only detection labels are added in the second phase. The enhancement task for the real data is weakly-supervised with information from their detection labels. Our methods are demonstrated in a real document dataset with performances exceeding those of other text detection methods. Moreover, ablations are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness of the synthetic data, auxiliary task, and weak-supervision. Whereas the existing text detection studies mostly focus on the text in scenes, our proposed method is optimized to the applications for the text in scanned documents.},

Besides privacy issues, parties also have concerns regarding the vulnerability against recommendation manipulation attempts, referred to as shilling attacks. Although there are methods for detecting these injected malicious profiles in central server-based configurations, they are not readily suitable for employing arbitrarily distributed data. In this paper, we present a novel classification-based shilling attack detection protocol enabling the recognition of malicious profiles in arbitrarily distributed configurations without compromising the privacy of collaborating parties. The analysis of the proposed protocol regarding confidentiality of parties reveals that the process is bound to collaboration by design, which does not allow parties to achieve detection by themselves. Furthermore, empirical evaluations using real-world preference data demonstrate that the protocol can achieve significantly high detection rates facilitating privacy-aware data collaboration.},

abstract={Many researchers have incorporated deep neural networks (DNNs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in automatic trading systems. However, such methods result in complicated algorithmic trading models with several defects, especially when a DNN model is vulnerable to malicious adversarial samples. Researches have rarely focused on planning for long-term attacks against RL-based trading systems. To neutralize these attacks, researchers must consider generating imperceptible perturbations while simultaneously reducing the number of modified steps. In this research, an adversary is used to attack an RL-based trading agent. First, we propose an extension of the ensemble of the identical independent evaluators (EIIE) method, called enhanced EIIE, in which information on the best bids and asks is incorporated. Enhanced EIIE was demonstrated to produce an authoritative trading agent that yields better portfolio performance relative to that of an EIIE agent. Enhanced EIIE was then applied to the adversarial agent for the agent to learn when and how much to attack (in the form of introducing perturbations).In our experiments, our proposed adversarial attack mechanisms were > 30% more effective at reducing accumulated portfolio value relative to the conventional attack mechanisms of the fast gradient sign method (FSGM) and iterative FSGM, which are currently more commonly researched and adapted to compare and improve.},

abstract={The emerging of machine learning has massively promoted the abilities of computational sustainability in natural resource management and allocation. Many Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft now provide Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) to meet the increasing demand for machine learning services. However, the prediction results of training data and testing data with the same machine learning model in MLaaS have remarkable differences, and thus the attackers can leverage machine learning techniques to launch the so-called membership inference attacks, i.e., to infer whether a record is in the training data or not. In this paper, we propose MIASec that can guarantee the data indistinguishability of the training data and thereby has the ability to defend against membership inference attacks in MLaaS. The key idea of MIASec is to narrow the dynamic ranges of vital features in the training data, such that the training data, the testing data, and even the synthetic data have almost semblable prediction results by the same machine learning model. With elaborated design on modifying the values of vital features in the training data, MIASec can thus reduce the differences between the model's outcomes of training data and testing data, thereby protecting the training data in effect while keeping the model's accuracy stable. We empirically evaluate MIASec on machine learning models trained by off-line neural networks and on-line MLaaS. Using realistic data and classification tasks, our experiment results show that MIASec can defend the membership inference attacks effectively. In particular, MIASec can reduce the precision and recall of attacks respectively by 11.7 and 15.4 percent in average, and by 18.6 and 21.8 percent at best.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel decomposition method of full-waveform Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) echo is proposed. This decomposition method includes four steps. In the first step, the noise mean value and deviation are estimated, meanwhile noise threshold and fitting threshold are configured. In the second step, full-waveform echoes are smoothed using the Gaussian kernel function. In third step, maximum points and inflection points are detected aiming at filtered echoes in the second step. Meanwhile, the number of echo component in full-waveform echo and initial parameters of each echo component are estimated based on the maximum points and inflection points, and echo components are sorted depending on the area of echo components. In the fourth step, the full-waveform echoes are one by one addition fitted using Levenburg-Marquardt (LM) method based on sorted result and fitting threshold. At last, the correct rate, and relative and absolute error of this decomposition method are simulation verified using MATLAB software based on randomly generated data. The result shows that the whole decomposition correct rate of this method is 82%, the maximal relative error of location is 0.18%, the maximal absolute error of amplitude is 1.2157 millivolts, the maximal absolute error of location is 0.5548 nanoseconds, and the maximal absolute error of FWHM is -2.219 nanoseconds. The decomposition correct rate and parameter error show that decomposition coefficients can be further used for target feature extraction and classification.},

In this paper, we extend previous work with LACE2 which reduces the amount of data shared by using multi-party data sharing. Here data owners incrementally add data to a cache passed among them and contribute "interesting" data that are not similar to the current content of the cache. Also, before data owner i passes the cache to data owner j, privacy is preserved by applying obfuscation algorithms to hide project details. The experiments of this paper show that (a) LACE2 is comparatively less expensive than the single-party approach and (b) the multi-party approach of LACE2 yields higher privacy than the prior approach without damaging predictive efficacy (indeed, in some cases, LACE2 leads to better defect predictors).},

abstract={Cyber criminals are covertly attacking critical infrastructures, and botnets are a common component of those attacks. In recent years, botnets have been shifting their focus from broad-based attacks to more targeted ones such as attacking financial institutions, especially banks. The primary reason for this shift towards financial institutions is that, where the money is. We present an empirical study of the components, features and operations of some of the most widely deployed HTTP-based financial botnets (such as Zeus, SpyEye, ICE 1X, Citadel, Carberp, Tinba, Bugat and Shylock). Our study provides critical insights into the design of these botnets and should help the security community to generate intelligence and develop more robust security solutions to defend against cyber attacks by these botnets. In addition, our comparative analysis of insidious techniques pertaining to Command and Control (C&C) communication, system exploitation and data exfiltration also provides an effective and a holistic view of the capabilities of HTTP-based financial botnets. This study also highlights the evolution of various HTTP-based financial botnets over a period of time. Finally, we discuss security solutions that can help mitigate some of the techniques used by HTTP-based financial botnets.},

abstract={Defending adversarial attack is a critical step towards reliable deployment of deep learning empowered solutions for industrial applications. Probabilistic adversarial robustness (PAR), as a theoretical framework, is introduced to neutralize adversarial attacks by concentrating sample probability to adversarial-free zones. Distinct to most of the existing defense mechanisms that require modifying the architecture/training of the target classifier which is not feasible in the real-world scenario, e.g., when a model has already been deployed, PAR is designed in the first place to provide proactive protection to an existing fixed model. ShieldNet is implemented as a demonstration of PAR in this work by using PixelCNN. Experimental results show that this approach is generalizable, robust against adversarial transferability and resistant to a wide variety of attacks on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively.},

abstract={The proliferation of ubiquitous computing requires energy-efficient as well as secure operation of modern processors. Side channel attacks are becoming a critical threat to security and privacy of devices embedded in modern computing infrastructures. Unintended information leakage via physical signatures such as power consumption, electromagnetic emission (EM) and execution time have emerged as a key security consideration for SoCs. Also, information published on purpose at user privilege level accessible through software interfaces results in software-only attacks. In this paper, we used a supervised learning based approach for inferring applications executing on android platform based on features extracted from EM side-channel emissions and software exposed dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) states. We highlight the importance of machine learning based approach in utilizing these multi-dimensional features on a complex SoC, against profiling-based approaches. We also show that learning the instantaneous frequency states polled from on-board frequency driver (cpufreq) is adequate to identify a known application and flag potentially malicious unknown application. The experimental results on benchmarking applications running on ARMv8 processor in Snapdragon 820 board demonstrates early detection of these apps in 700 ms, and atleast 85% accuracy in detecting unknown applications. Overall, the highlight is to utilize a low-complexity path to application inference attacks through learning instantaneous frequency states pattern of CPU core.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a side-channel resilient moving target defense mechanism against power-/electromagnetic-based side-channel attacks. Recent countermeasures use fresh rekeying after every encryption/decryption process; this causes major overhead in synchronizing the communicating parties. In contrast to previous work, our mechanism integrates fresh rekeying and masking techniques at an interval, where these techniques are driven by the maximum number of side-channel leakage traces required toward a successful embedded attack. Hence, the mechanism tracks the effect of attacks on the number of traces, and consequently applies rekeying at suitable intervals to reduce the computational/communication overhead, while increasing the attack cost. The mechanism scalability was evaluated against an advanced attack model based on machine learning methods that reduces significantly the number of traces required for a successful attack under masking implementation.},

abstract={Adverse weather conditions are extremely challenging for autonomous driving as most state-of-the-art sensors do not function reliably under such circumstances. One method to increase the detection performance is to fuse the raw data signal with neural networks that learn robust features from multiple inputs. Nevertheless noise due to adverse weather is complex, and in addition, automotive sensors fail asymmetrically. Neural networks that perform feature level sensor fusion can be particularly vulnerable if one sensor is corrupted by noise outside the training data distribution compared to decision level fusion. The reason for this is that no built-in mathematical mechanism prevents noise in one sensor channel from corrupting the overall network even though other sensor channels may provide high-quality data. We propose a simple data augmentation scheme that shows a neural network may be able to ignore data from underperforming sensors even though it has never seen that data during training. One can summarize this as a learned “OR” operation at fusion stage. This learned operation is also generally applicable to other noise-types not present during training.},

abstract={In recent years, the malicious insider threat has become one of the most significant cyber security threats that an organisation can be subject to. Due to an insider's natural ability to evade deployed information security mechanisms such as firewalls and endpoint protections, the detection of an insider threat can be challenging. Moreover, compared to the volume of audit data that an organization collects for the purpose of intrusion/anomaly detection, the digital footprint left by a malicious insider's action can be minuscule. To detect insider threats from large and complex audit data, in this paper, we propose a detection system that implements anomaly detection using an ensemble of deep autoencoders. Each autoencoder in the ensemble is trained using a certain category of audit data, which represents a user's normal behaviour accurately. The reconstruction error obtained between the original and the decoded data is used to measure whether any behaviour is anomalous or not. After the data has been processed by the individually trained autoencoders and the respective reconstruction errors obtained, a joint decision-making mechanism is used to report a user's overall maliciousness score. Numerical experiments are conducted using a benchmark dataset for insider threat detection. Results indicate that the proposed detection system is able to detect all of the malicious insider actions with a reasonable false positive rate.},

abstract={Advanced communications and data processing technologies bring great benefits to the smart grid. However, cyber-security threats also extend from the information system to the smart grid. The existing security works for smart grid focus on traditional protection and detection methods. However, a lot of threats occur in a very short time and overlooked by exiting security components. These threats usually have huge impacts on smart gird and disturb its normal operation. Moreover, it is too late to take action to defend against the threats once they are detected, and damages could be difficult to repair. To address this issue, this paper proposes a security situational awareness mechanism based on the analysis of big data in the smart grid. Fuzzy cluster based analytical method, game theory and reinforcement learning are integrated seamlessly to perform the security situational analysis for the smart grid. The simulation and experimental results show the advantages of our scheme in terms of high efficiency and low error rate for security situational awareness.},

abstract={Wireless spoofing attacks are easy to launch and can significantly impact the performance of networks. Although the identity of a node can be verified through cryptographic authentication, conventional security approaches are not always desirable because of their overhead requirements. In this paper, we propose to use spatial information, a physical property associated with each node, hard to falsify, and not reliant on cryptography, as the basis for 1) detecting spoofing attacks; 2) determining the number of attackers when multiple adversaries masquerading as the same node identity; and 3) localizing multiple adversaries. We propose to use the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. We then formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as a multiclass detection problem. Cluster-based mechanisms are developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data are available, we explore using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers. In addition, we developed an integrated detection and localization system that can localize the positions of multiple attackers. We evaluated our techniques through two testbeds using both an 802.11 (WiFi) network and an 802.15.4 (ZigBee) network in two real office buildings. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods can achieve over 90 percent Hit Rate and Precision when determining the number of attackers. Our localization results using a representative set of algorithms provide strong evidence of high accuracy of localizing multiple adversaries.},

abstract={Attacks on cloud-computing services are becoming more prevalent with recent victims including Tesla, Aviva Insurance and SIM-card manufacturer Gemalto[1]. The risk posed to organisations from malicious insiders is becoming more widely known about and consequently many are now investing in hardware, software and new processes to try to detect these attacks. As for all types of attack vector, there will always be those which are not known about and those which are known about but remain exceptionally difficult to detect - particularly in a timely manner. We believe that insider attacks are of particular concern in a cloud-computing environment, and that cloud-service providers should enhance their ability to detect them by means of indirect detection. We propose a combined attack-tree and kill-chain based method for identifying multiple indirect detection measures. Specifically, the use of attack trees enables us to encapsulate all detection opportunities for insider attacks in cloud-service environments. Overlaying the attack tree on top of a kill chain in turn facilitates indirect detection opportunities higher-up the tree as well as allowing the provider to determine how far an attack has progressed once suspicious activity is detected. We demonstrate the method through consideration of a specific type of insider attack - that of attempting to capture virtual machines in transit within a cloud cluster via use of a network tap, however, the process discussed here applies equally to all cloud paradigms.},

abstract={Cyber-criminals use various malware technologies to bypass antivirus software. For example, drive-by downloads happen without a person's knowledge when visiting a website, viewing an email message, or clicking on a deceptive pop-up window. One way to understand drive-by download attacks is to study the connections between different drive-by download behaviors during the installation phase. However, current solutions need a large number of browsing records from ISPs to build up a model. Insufficient historical browsing data may prevent this approach from working. In this study, we propose Ziffersystem, a system that identifies the suspicious connections in a targeted enterprise. We develop a graph-based model of malicious orchestrated behaviors. Ziffersystem does not need large-scale network data (e.g., IPS traffic) to model malicious activity, and therefore the system is useful for an enterprise with few in-house blacklists and highly sensitive data. We apply the proposed system to the analysis of blacklists from public and private sources, and we show its effectiveness for visualizing malicious download behavior that cannot be identified through piecewise event logs.},

abstract={With rapid progress and significant successes in a wide spectrum of applications, deep learning is being applied in many safety-critical environments. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently found vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples. Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible to human but can easily fool DNNs in the testing/deploying stage. The vulnerability to adversarial examples becomes one of the major risks for applying DNNs in safety-critical environments. Therefore, attacks and defenses on adversarial examples draw great attention. In this paper, we review recent findings on adversarial examples for DNNs, summarize the methods for generating adversarial examples, and propose a taxonomy of these methods. Under the taxonomy, applications for adversarial examples are investigated. We further elaborate on countermeasures for adversarial examples. In addition, three major challenges in adversarial examples and the potential solutions are discussed.},

However, both attacks and defenses have focused on an adversary that indiscriminately attacks all the records without regard to the cost of false positives or negatives. In this work, we revisit membership inference attacks from the perspective of a pragmatic adversary who carefully selects targets and make predictions conservatively. We design a new evaluation methodology that allows us to evaluate the membership privacy risk at the level of individuals and not only in aggregate. We experimentally demonstrate that highly vulnerable records exist even when the aggregate attack precision is close to 50% (baseline). Specifically, on the MNIST dataset, our pragmatic adversary achieves a precision of 95.05% whereas the prior attack only achieves a precision of 51.7%.},

abstract={Recently, many deep learning-based methods have been developed for solving remote sensing (RS) scene classification or retrieval tasks. Most of the adopted loss functions for training these models require accurate annotations. However, the presence of noise in such annotations (also known as label noise) cannot be avoided in large-scale RS benchmark archives, resulting from geo-location/registration errors, land-cover changes, and diverse knowledge background of annotators. To overcome the influence of noisy labels on the learning process of deep models, we propose a new loss function called noise-tolerant deep neighborhood embedding which can accurately encode the semantic relationships among RS scenes. Specifically, we target at maximizing the leave-one-out K-NN score for uncovering the inherent neighborhood structure among the images in feature space. Moreover, we down-weight the contribution of potential noisy images by learning their localized structure and pruning the images with low leave-one-out K-NN scores. Based on our newly proposed loss function, classwise features can be more robustly discriminated. Our experiments, conducted on two benchmark RS datasets, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three different RS scene interpretation tasks, including classification, clustering, and retrieval. The codes of this article will be publicly available from https://github.com/jiankang1991.},

abstract={The field of computer vision has witnessed phenomenal progress in recent years partially due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks. However, deep learning models are notoriously sensitive to adversarial examples which are synthesized by adding quasi-perceptible noises on real images. Some existing defense methods require to re-train attacked target networks and augment the train set via known adversarial attacks, which is inefficient and might be unpromising with unknown attack types. To overcome the above issues, we propose a portable defense method, online alternate generator, which does not need to access or modify the parameters of the target networks. The proposed method works by online synthesizing another image from scratch for an input image, instead of removing or destroying adversarial noises. To avoid pretrained parameters exploited by attackers, we alternately update the generator and the synthesized image at the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed defensive scheme and method outperforms a series of state-of-the-art defending models against gray-box adversarial attacks.},

This type of attack consists of two phases, the profiling of the device (template building) and the template matching phase. Template matching can create a significant overhead in the performance of the attack, due to the large amount of data that needs to be processed for every possible value. On the other hand, machine learning techniques are developed to provide efficient pattern recognition and feature extraction algorithms, mainly used in artificial intelligence. In this work, we combine techniques from machine learning with template attacks, in order to improve the efficiency of template attacks focusing on the template matching phase. More precisely, we compare three classification algorithms on a template data set built during the execution of a regular scalar multiplication algorithm (double-and-add-always) of mbedTLS (formerly PolarSSL).

abstract={Digital surface models (DSMs) are sets of elevation data of the Earth's surface, useful for applications such as urban studies and height estimation of buildings. They can be derived from a set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired in an interferometric or tomographic configuration. Each image acquisition is usually focused in radar geometry. In this work, we present steps required to derive DSMs from SAR single-look complex (SLC) products focused in map geometry (geocoded). We modified existing tomographic reconstruction techniques to be able to operate with geocoded SLCs and extended methods to operate with 3-D geocoded SLCs. The performance analysis showed that methods using 3-D geocoded SLC products yielded DSMs with fewer outliers and retained more information of the illuminated area, with a cost of higher computational complexity. Compressive sensing methods using 2-D geocoded SLCs can be a good alternative due to their comparatively moderate computational complexity.},

abstract={Cloud application marketplaces of modern cloud infrastructures offer a new software deployment model, integrated with the cloud environment in its configuration and policies. However, similar to traditional software distribution which has been suffering from software piracy and reverse engineering, cloud marketplaces face the same challenges that can deter the success of the evolving ecosystem of cloud software. We present a novel system named CAFE for cloud infrastructures where sensitive software logic can be executed with high secrecy protected from any piracy or reverse engineering attempts in a virtual machine even when its operating system kernel is compromised. The key mechanism is the end-to-end framework for the execution of applications, which consists of the secure encryption and distribution of confidential application binary files, and the runtime techniques to load, decrypt, and protect the program logic by isolating them from tenant virtual machines based on hypervisor-level techniques. We evaluate applications in several software categories which are commonly offered in cloud marketplaces showing that strong confidential execution can be provided with only marginal changes (around 100-220 lines of code) and minimal performance overhead. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CAFE in cloud marketplaces.},

abstract={Because of the dynamic nature of network traffic patterns, such as new traffic application arrivals or flash events, it is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional anomaly detection systems to separate various applications based on their traffic patterns. In this paper, by leveraging transport layer packet-level and flow-level features, new structures called application fingerprints are generated, which express such features in a compact and efficient manner. Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving an accuracy of over 97%, whereas the misclassification rate is only 2.5%.},

abstract={The advanced features of 5G mobile wireless network systems yield new security requirements and challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the security of 5G wireless network systems compared with the traditional cellular networks. The paper starts with a review on 5G wireless networks particularities as well as on the new requirements and motivations of 5G wireless security. The potential attacks and security services are summarized with the consideration of new service requirements and new use cases in 5G wireless networks. The recent development and the existing schemes for the 5G wireless security are presented based on the corresponding security services, including authentication, availability, data confidentiality, key management, and privacy. This paper further discusses the new security features involving different technologies applied to 5G, such as heterogeneous networks, device-to-device communications, massive multiple-input multiple-output, software-defined networks, and Internet of Things. Motivated by these security research and development activities, we propose a new 5G wireless security architecture, based on which the analysis of identity management and flexible authentication is provided. As a case study, we explore a handover procedure as well as a signaling load scheme to show the advantages of the proposed security architecture.

The proposed platform is able to support a new paradigm for the management of patients with COPD, by integrating clinical data and parameters monitored in daily life using Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Therefore, the doctor is provided with a dynamic picture of the disease and its impact on lifestyle and vice versa, and can thus plan more personalized diagnostics, therapeutics, and social interventions.

abstract={Fashion is a major segment in e-commerce with growing importance and a steadily increasing number of products. Since manual annotation of apparel items is very tedious, the product databases need to be organized automatically, e.g. by image classification. Common image classification approaches are based on features engineered for general purposes which perform poorly on specific images of apparel. We therefore propose to learn discriminative features based on a small set of annotated images. We experimentally evaluate our method on a dataset with 30,000 images containing apparel items, and compare it to other engineered and learned sets of features. The classification accuracy of our features is significantly superior to designed HOG and SIFT features (43.7% and 16.1% relative improvement, respectively). Our method allows for fast feature extraction and training, is easy to implement and, unlike deep convolutional networks, does not require powerful dedicated hardware.},

year={2020},
volume={},
number={},
pages={262-272},
abstract={Logic locking has been proposed as an obfuscation technique to protect outsourced IC designs from IP piracy by untrusted entities in the design and fabrication process. In this case, the netlist is locked by adding extra key-gates, and will be unlocked only if a correct key is applied to the key-gates. The key is assumed to be written into a non-volatile memory after the fabrication by the IP owner. In the past several years, the focus of the research community has been mostly on Oracle-guided attacks, such as SAT attacks, on logic locking and proposing proper countermeasures against such attacks. However, none of the reported research in the literature has ever challenged a more fundamental assumption of logic locking, which is the security of the key itself. In other words, if an adversary can read out the correct key after insertion, the security of the entire scheme is broken. In this work, we first review possible adversaries for the locked circuits and their capabilities. Afterward, we demonstrate that even with the assumption of having a tamper- and read-proof memory for the key storage, which is not vulnerable to any physical attacks, the key transfer between the memory and the key-gates through registers and buffers make the key extraction by an adversary possible. To support our claim, we implemented a proof-of-concept locked circuit as well as one of the standard logic locking benchmarks on an FPGA manufactured with a 28 nm technology and extract obfuscation keys using optical probing. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of the proposed attack in different scenarios and propose potential countermeasures.},

abstract={Classifying sequential data is an important problem in machine learning with applications in time series, sensor streams, and image analysis. The ordered structure of sequential data presents a difficulty for the standard classification models, which has motivated the task of generating features for vector-based discriminative models. Shapelet methods, which have been extensively studied in this topic, identify class-specific subsequence patterns and exploit dissimilarity from them. Their approach merits the classification performance and the visual interpretability of the discriminative patterns. In this paper, we aim to improve on the robustness of the pattern-based discriminative model by considering the sequential data instances a "bag" of characteristic patterns. We propose a data cleaning method for generating small clusters of class-specific patterns and a vector representation which features the distance between clustered patterns and the sequential instance seen as a bag-of-subsequences. We further employ max-margin learning and feature selection to extract few class-characterizing patterns. We present numerical experiments using time series and silhouette image data and compared the performances of the proposed methods with other time series classification models. Our visual analysis of the extracted features showed that the proposed method can extract characteristic subsequences of the data.},

abstract={Object recognition and pose estimation from RGB-D images are important tasks for manipulation robots which can be learned from examples. Creating and annotating datasets for learning is expensive, however. We address this problem with transfer learning from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are pre-trained for image categorization and provide a rich, semantically meaningful feature set. We incorporate depth information, which the CNN was not trained with, by rendering objects from a canonical perspective and colorizing the depth channel according to distance from the object center. We evaluate our approach on the Washington RGB-D Objects dataset, where we find that the generated feature set naturally separates classes and instances well and retains pose manifolds. We outperform state-of-the-art on a number of subtasks and show that our approach can yield superior results when only little training data is available.},

abstract={The growing number of voice-enabled devices and applications consider automatic speaker verification (ASV) a fundamental component. However, maximum outreach for ASV in critical domains e.g., financial services and health care, is not possible unless we overcome security breaches caused by voice cloning algorithms and replayed audios. Therefore, to overcome these vulnerabilities, a secure ASV (SASV) system based on the novel sign modified acoustic local ternary pattern (sm-ALTP) features and asymmetric bagging-based classifier-ensemble with enhanced attack vector is presented. The proposed audio representation approach clusters the high and low frequency components in audio frames by normally distributing frequency components against a convex function. Then, the neighborhood statistics are applied to capture the user specific vocal tract information. The proposed SASV system simultaneously verifies the bonafide speakers and detects the voice cloning attack, cloning algorithm used to synthesize cloned audio (in the defined settings), and voice-replay attacks over the ASVspoof 2019 dataset. In addition, the proposed method detects the voice replay and cloned voice replay attacks over the VSDC dataset. Both the voice cloning algorithm detection and cloned-replay attack detection are novel concepts introduced in this paper. The voice cloning algorithm detection module determines the voice cloning algorithm used to generate the fake audios. Whereas, the cloned voice replay attack detection is performed to determine the SASV behavior when audio samples are simultaneously contemplated with cloning and replay artifacts.},

In the current approach, we have represented the players and the ball passing among themselves using a dynamic social network structure. Now, the challenging task is to differentiate the game maker from any match where the performance of any individual player is not directly involved with the cumulative effect of the scoring mechanism. Different temporal graph centrality metrics, such as degree, closeness, betweenness, and clustering coefficient, have differentiated the game maker in the ball-passing network. We have analyzed some random games of FIFA men's world cup 2018, to distinguish the game makers from the matches as a case study. Another challenging problem is to locate the tactical position of the influential passes. We have investigated the games and identified those areas in different time frames. The accuracy of our method is tested over the real-life benchmark data set. The analytical results exhibit notable improvement over the existing methods. Our study opens up a new framework for the strategic analysis not only for soccer but also for similar ball-passing multiplayer team games, such as basketball and hockey.},

abstract={Intellectual Property (IP) theft is a serious concern for the integrated circuit (IC) industry. To address this concern, logic locking countermeasure transforms a logic circuit to a different one to obfuscate its inner details. The transformation caused by obfuscation is reversed only upon application of the programmed secret key, thus preserving the circuit's original function. This technique is known to be vulnerable to Satisfiability (SAT)-based attacks. But in order to succeed, SAT-based attacks implicitly assume a perfectly reverse-engineered circuit, which is difficult to achieve in practice due to reverse engineering (RE) errors caused by automated circuit extraction. In this paper, we analyze the effects of random circuit RE-errors on the success of SAT-based attacks. Empirical evaluation on ISCAS, MCNC benchmarks as well as a fully-fledged RISC-V CPU reveals that the attack success degrades exponentially with increase in the number of random RE-errors. Therefore, the adversaries either have to equip RE-tools with near perfection or propose better SAT-based attacks that can work with RE-imperfections.},

abstract={Digital databases serve as the vehicles for compiling, disseminating and utilizing all forms of information that are pivotal for societal development. A major challenge that needs to be tackled is to recover crucial information that may be lost due to malicious attacks on database integrity. In the domain of digital watermarking, past research has focused on robust watermarking for establishing database ownership and fragile watermarking for tamper detection. In this paper, we propose a new technique for multiple watermarking of relational databases that provides a unified solution to two major security concerns; ownership identification and information recovery. In order to resolve ownership conflicts a secure watermark is embedded using a secret key known only to the database owner. Another watermark encapsulates granular information on user-specified crucial attributes in a manner such that the perturbed or lost data can be regenerated conveniently later. Theoretical analysis shows that the probability of successful regeneration of tampered/lost data improves dramatically as we increase the number of candidate attributes for embedding the watermark. We experimentally verify that the proposed technique is robust enough to extract the watermark accurately even after 100% tuple addition or alteration and after 98% tuple deletion.},

abstract={Collaborative spectrum sensing improves the spectrum state estimation accuracy but is vulnerable to the potential attacks from malicious secondary cognitive radio (CR) users, and thus raises security concerns. One promising malicious user detection method is to identify their abnormal statistical spectrum sensing behaviors. From this angle, two hidden Markov models (HMMs) corresponding to honest and malicious users respectively are adopted in this paper to characterize their different sensing behaviors, and malicious user detection is achieved via detecting the difference in the corresponding HMM parameters. To obtain the HMM estimates, an effective inference algorithm that can simultaneously estimate two HMMs without requiring separated training sequences is also developed. By using these estimates, high malicious user detection accuracy can be achieved at the fusion center, leading to more robust and reliable collaborative spectrum sensing performance (substantially enlarged operational regions) in the presence of malicious users, as compared to the baseline approaches. Different fusion methods are also discussed and compared.},

abstract={Backdoor attacks have become a serious security concern because of the rising popularity of unverified third party machine learning resources such as datasets, pretrained models, and processors. Pre-trained models and shared datasets have become popular due to the high training requirement of deep learning. This raises a serious security concern since the shared models and datasets may be modified intentionally in order to reduce system efficacy. A backdoor attack is difficult to detect since the embedded adversarial decision rule will only be triggered by a pre-chosen pattern, and the contaminated model behaves normally on benign samples. This paper devises a backdoor attack detection method to identify whether a sample is attacked for image-related applications. The information consistence provided by an image without each segment is considered. The absence of the segment containing a trigger strongly affects the consistence since the trigger dominates the decision. Our proposed method is evaluated empirically to confirm the effectiveness in various settings. As there is no restrictive assumption on the trigger of backdoor attacks, we expect our proposed model is generalizable and can defend against a wider range of modern attacks.},

abstract={Spurred by developments such as cloud computing, there has been considerable recent interest in the paradigm of data mining-as-a-service. A company (data owner) lacking in expertise or computational resources can outsource its mining needs to a third party service provider (server). However, both the items and the association rules of the outsourced database are considered private property of the corporation (data owner). To protect corporate privacy, the data owner transforms its data and ships it to the server, sends mining queries to the server, and recovers the true patterns from the extracted patterns received from the server. In this paper, we study the problem of outsourcing the association rule mining task within a corporate privacy-preserving framework. We propose an attack model based on background knowledge and devise a scheme for privacy preserving outsourced mining. Our scheme ensures that each transformed item is indistinguishable with respect to the attacker's background knowledge, from at least k-1 other transformed items. Our comprehensive experiments on a very large and real transaction database demonstrate that our techniques are effective, scalable, and protect privacy.},

This system could warn people of terrorist strikes by text message. With the popularity of Social Networks, mostly news providers used to split their news in various social networking sites and web blogs. In India, many news groups stake their news on Twitter micro blogging service provider which provides real-nature to the system. The system is an early precursor that collects and analyzes real-time news of events such as terrorist attack, hijack, bomb blast etc. from Twitter and detects a target event. Objective behind is to ooze message to all the phones in a given area, providing them with up-to-date and accurate guidance on the specific threat and the best way to escape. Machine learning techniques were used to train the data. In order to create the instances words from each short message were consider and bag-of-words approach was used to create feature vector. The data was trained using KNN (K - Nearest Neighbor) machine learning techniques. The KNN is a typical learning algorithm based on analogy, so if category has a certain amount of the training samples which helps to guarantee the accuracy of classification. Large amount of feature will be collected for current research. The performance will speak the efficaciousness of the system.},

First, our gesture recognition enables the use of simple head gestures as input. It is accurate in various wearer activities regardless of noise. Particularly, we improve the recognition efficiency significantly by employing a novel similarity search scheme. Second, our gesture-based authentication can identify owner through features extracted from head movements. We improve the authentication performance by proposing new features based on peak analyses, and employing an ensemble method. Last, we implement GlassGesture and present extensive evaluations. GlassGesture achieves a gesture recognition accuracy near 96%. For authentication, GlassGesture can accept authorized users in near 92% of trials, and reject attackers in near 99% of trials. We also show that in 100 trials imitators cannot successfully masquerade as the authorized user even once.},

Such violations cannot be easily recognized by the administrators who manage the cluster, because of limited observation of the events in the cyber-physical systems. We describe real cases of failures due to problems in the cooling system of Blue Waters, the petascale supercomputer of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Blue Waters has cooling cabinets that use chilled water provided by the National Petascale Computing Facility (NPCF). We demonstrate, using real data, that the control systems that provide chilled water can be used as entry points by an attacker to indirectly compromise the computing functionality through the orchestration of clever alterations of sensing and control devices. In this way, the attacker does not leave any trace of his or her malicious activity on the nodes of the cluster. Failures of the cooling systems can trigger unrecoverable failure modes that can be recovered only after service interruption and manual intervention.},

Extracting hand regions in ego-centric videos is a critical step for understanding hand-object manipulation and analyzing hand-eye coordination. However, in contrast to traditional applications of hand detection, such as gesture interfaces or sign-language recognition, ego-centric videos present new challenges such as rapid changes in illuminations, significant camera motion and complex hand-object manipulations. To quantify the challenges and performance in this new domain, we present a fully labeled indoor/outdoor ego-centric hand detection benchmark dataset containing over 200 million labeled pixels, which contains hand images taken under various illumination conditions. Using both our dataset and a publicly available ego-centric indoors dataset, we give extensive analysis of detection performance using a wide range of local appearance features. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of sparse features and the importance of modeling global illumination. We propose a modeling strategy based on our findings and show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches.},

Numerous techniques have been proposed and developed to optimize server power consumption and achieve energy proportional computing. However, the security perspective of server power management has not yet been studied. In this paper, we investigate energy attacks, a new type of malicious exploits on server systems. Targeted solely at abusing server power consumption, energy attacks exhibit very different attacking behaviors and cause very different victim symptoms from conventional cyberspace attacks. First, we unveil that today's server systems with improved power saving technologies are more vulnerable to energy attacks. Then, we demonstrate a realistic energy attack on a stand-alone server system in three steps: 1) by profiling energy cost of an open web service under different operation conditions, we identify the vulnerabilities that subject a server to energy attacks; 2) exploiting the discovered attack vectors, we design an energy attack that can be launched anonymously from remote; and 3) we execute the attack and measure the extent of its damage in a systematic manner. Finally, we highlight the challenges in defending against energy attacks, and we propose an effective defense scheme to meet the challenges and evaluate its effectiveness.},

abstract={Recognizing the expressions of partially occluded faces is a challenging computer vision problem. Previous expression recognition methods, either overlooked this issue or resolved it using unrealistic assumptions. Motivated by the fact that the human visual system is adept at ignoring the occlusions and focus on non-occluded facial areas, we propose a landmark-guided attention branch to find and discard corrupted features from occluded regions so that they are not used for recognition. An attention map is first generated to indicate if a specific facial part is occluded and guide our model to attend to non-occluded regions. To further improve robustness, we propose a facial region branch to partition the feature maps into non-overlapping facial blocks and task each block to predict the expression independently. This results in more diverse and discriminative features, enabling the expression recognition system to re-cover even though the face is partially occluded. Depending on the synergistic effects of the two branches, our occlusion-adaptive deep network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two challenging in-the-wild benchmark datasets and three real-world occluded expression datasets.},

One particularly popular attack is the Sybil attack, in which the adversary creates many fake accounts called Sybils in order to, for instance, distribute spam or manipulate voting results. A first generation of defense systems tried to detect these Sybils by analyzing changes in the structure of the OSN graph-unfortunately with limited success. Based on these efforts a second generation of solutions enriches the graph-structural approaches with higher-level user features in order to detect Sybil nodes more efficiently. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of these defenses. We describe their common design and working principles, analyze their vulnerabilities, and design simple yet effective attack strategies that an adversary could launch to circumvent these systems. In our evaluation we reveal that an miscreant can exploit the credulity of OSN users and follow a targeted attack strategy to successfully avoid detection by all existing approaches.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in our daily life, which enables various objects to be interconnected for data exchange, including physical devices, vehicles, and other items embedded with network connectivity. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a vital application of IoT, providing many kinds of information among sensors, whereas such network is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, especially insider attacks, due to its natural environment and inherent unreliable transmission. To safeguard its security, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely adopted in a WSN to defend against insider attacks through implementing proper trust-based mechanisms. However, in the era of big data, sensors may generate excessive information and data, which could degrade the effectiveness of trust computation. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and propose a way of combining Bayesian-based trust management with traffic sampling for wireless intrusion detection under a hierarchical structure. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our approach in both a simulated and a real network environment. Experimental results demonstrate that packet-based trust management would become ineffective in a heavy traffic environment, and that our approach can help lighten the burden of IDSs in handling traffic, while maintaining the detection of insider attacks.},

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have been designed to perform a more agile and efficient automation, control, and orchestration of future industrial systems while improving the energy efficiency in smart factories. Unfortunately, while the benefits of the IIoT are undeniable, their pervasive adoption as key enablers for future industries also paved the way for new security risks. In fact, the damaging effects of exploiting vulnerable IIoT have been repeatedly demonstrated and publicly reported. The Mirai botnet, various reports on hackable and invasive devices, alongside the infamous Stuxnet malware, constitute significant proof on the undisputed and disruptive effect of the malware-targeting IIoT systems. As a response, a plethora of solutions has been developed to address the issue of securing IIoT systems in specific sectors. Nevertheless, we believe that the gradual decay of the IIoT's physical dimension (e.g., the physical process), also called aging, is a natural component of the IIoT's life cycle, which has not received sufficient attention from the scientific community. This paper develops a methodology for detecting abnormal behavior in the context of aging IIoT. The approach leverages multivariate statistical analysis [e.g., principle component analysis (PCA)], alongside the Hotelling's T2 statistics, and the univariate cumulative sum in order to detect abnormal process events. An innovative feature of the developed approach is the detection of stealth attacks attempting to influence the dataset in each age. The extensive experimental results on a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model demonstrate its applicability to the IIoT and its superior performance to the recently reported techniques.},

abstract={The use of geolocation databases (GDBs) for enabling spectrum sharing has been mandated by the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S. TV band and the 3.5 GHz band, and it is very likely to be adopted for spectrum sharing in other bands as well. Although using GDBs is a practical approach for enabling spectrum sharing, it raises a potentially serious operational security problem, especially when some of the primary users (PUs) are federal government entities, including military users. In this paper, we show that malicious queries can readily infer the locations of PUs by making multiple queries to the database even if the database's responses to queries do not directly reveal such information. To address this issue, we propose a perturbation-based optimal obfuscation strategy that can be implemented by the GDB to preserve the location privacy of PUs. The proposed obfuscation strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes PUs' location privacy while ensuring that the expected degradation in the secondary users' utility due to obfuscated responses does not exceed a threshold. Using results from extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in countering location inference attacks, including the inference strategy described in the paper.},

abstract={Preservation of image features caused by binary conversion is a difficult task under variation of illumination conditions. Several binary conversion-based methods have used an adaptive thresholding technique to improve their performance under illumination variation conditions because of its robustness. However, the performances of existing methods were still limited under high differences illumination conditions especially for uncontrolled lighting sources. In addition, various length of face-to-camera distance gives significant problem affect for the performance of face recognition method. It happens when various images are available for the same person with different length face-to-camera distances due to the appearance of varying facial features of the same person. Therefore, this study proposed to combine the strength normalization and feature-based method to build an illumination distribution model to overcome this problem. With the proposed method the illumination model will fit with variation of illumination conditions in a whole image to generate an adaptive threshold for a novel columnar binary conversion method. The proposed method consists of five main stages, starting with eye area detection using the developed Viola-Jones algorithm. Next, the iris is detected using the Circular Hough Transform (CHT) method and will convert it into binary using the proposed Columnar Binary Conversion (CBC) method to preserve the appearance of the facial features under the illumination variation. Then, the proposed Facial Feature Region Normalization (FFRN) method is performed to improve the effects of different optical zooms for the classification step. The classification is conducted based on the similarity measurement between the extracted normalised binary face region and the dataset that must be converted into their equivalent normalised binary images. The proposed method is evaluated on two different smartphone databases, namely as Smartphone Face Video (SFV) and MOBIO. The performance results showed the outperformance of the proposed method.},

abstract={Modern image classification systems are often built on deep neural networks, which suffer from adversarial examples--images with deliberately crafted, imperceptible noise to mislead the network's classification. To defend against adversarial examples, a plausible idea is to obfuscate the network's gradient with respect to the input image. This general idea has inspired a long line of defense methods. Yet, almost all of them have proven vulnerable. We revisit this seemingly flawed idea from a radically different perspective. We embrace the omnipresence of adversarial examples and the numerical procedure of crafting them, and turn this harmful attacking process into a useful defense mechanism. Our defense method is conceptually simple: before feeding an input image for classification, transform it by finding an adversarial example on a pre-trained external model. We evaluate our method against a wide range of possible attacks. On both CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets, our method is significantly more robust than state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, in comparison to adversarial training, our method offers lower training cost as well as stronger robustness.},

This paper outlines the results of our interviews with information technology (IT) defenders and operational technology (OT) operators and seeks to address lessons learned from them in the structure of our notional solutions. We present two problems in this paper: (1) the difficulty of coordinating detection and response between defenders who work on the cyber/IT and physical/OT sides of cyber-physical infrastructures, and (2) the difficulty of estimating the safety state of a cyber-physical system while an intrusion is underway but before damage can be effected by the attacker. To meet these challenges, we propose two solutions: (1) a visualization that will enable communication between IT defenders and OT operators, and (2) a machine-learning approach that will estimate the distance from normal the physical system is operating and send information to the visualization.},

In this paper, we first analyze the dataset from spatial and temporal dimensions. Second, we show that parking point information can re-identify anonymized trajectories of taxi drivers. Third, we find taxi GPS data could also expose passengers' privacy based on origin and destination (OD) queries. As a result, more than 55% trajectories can be re-identified at a probability of 1. Meanwhile, experimental results show that it is possible, using simple algorithms, to learn the destination of target passenger based on the naïve anonymized GPS data.},

abstract={Bad data injection is one of most dangerous attacks in smart grid, as it might lead to energy theft on the end users and device breakdown on the power generation. The attackers can construct the bad data evading the bad data detection mechanisms in power system. In this paper, a novel method, named as Adaptive Partitioning State Estimation (APSE), is proposed to detect bad data injection attack. The basic ideas are: 1) the large system is divided into several subsystems to improve the sensitivity of bad data detection; 2) the detection results are applied to guide the subsystem updating and re-partitioning to locate the bad data. Two attack cases are constructed to inject bad data into an IEEE 39-bus system, evading the traditional bad data detection mechanism. The experiments demonstrate that all bad data can be detected and located within a small area using APSE.},

year={2021},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8},
abstract={Current Computer Vision algorithms for classifying objects, such as Deep Nets, lack robustness to image changes which, although perceptible, would not fool a human observer. We quantify this by showing how performances of Deep Nets degrades badly on images where the objects are partially occluded and degrades even worse on more challenging and adversarial situations where, for example, patches are introduced in the images to target the weak points of the algorithm. To address this problem we develop a novel architecture, called Compositional Generative Networks (Compositional Nets) which is innately robust to these types of image changes. This architecture replaces the fully connected classification head of the deep network by a generative compositional model which includes an outlier process. This enables it, for example, to localize occluders and subsequently focus on the non-occluded parts of the object. We conduct classification experiments in a variety of situations including artificially occluded images, real images of partially occluded objects from the MS-COCO dataset, and adversarial patch attacks on PASCAL3D+ and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. Our results show that Compositional Nets are much more robust to occlusion and adversarial attacks, like patch attacks, compared to standard Deep Nets, even those which use data augmentation and adversarial training. Compositional Nets can also accurately localize these image changes, despite being trained only with class labels. We argue that testing vision algorithms in an adversarial manner which probes for the weakness of the algorithms, e.g., by patch attacks, is a more challenging way to evaluate them compared to standard methods, which simply test them on a random set of samples, and that Compositional Nets have the potential to overcome such challenges.},

abstract={Smart grid is built by combination of electric and information technologies and achieves the two-way interaction between power utilization and power generation. Unfortunately, new security threats appears together with cyber-physical communication systems. In order to properly monitor power network, an effective cyber attack detection and state estimation method are required to know attack and system states. This article considers the problem of robust grid state estimation and suggests a technique for distributed state estimation in power networks. First, the distribution power system incorporating multiple synchronous generators is modeled as a state-space framework, where attack occurs in measurements. Basically, the false data injection attacks can interfere with state estimation process by tampering with sensor measurements. Using mean squared error principle, the distributed dynamic state estimation algorithm is designed where local and neighboring gains are obtained using optimal filter and graph theory. For local gain computation, the attack parameter is obtained using the Bayesian learning process. The convergence condition of the proposed approach is derived. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to estimate the system state within a short period of time. Hopefully, the proposed methodology can be used to tolerate the cyber attacks for improving the confidence of the grid state estimation process.},

abstract={In modern integrated circuit (IC) designs, intellectual property (IP) cores are often outsourced and designed by third-party vendors, resulting in the partial relinquishment of the control over the IC design flow. Thus, reliable verifications are required to mitigate the threat of hardware Trojans (HTs) which may be inserted into IP cores by malicious vendors. Existing trustiness verification methods cannot take the merit of high efficiency and accuracy at the same time. In this paper, we propose a multilevel fast trustiness verification framework based on feature analysis to detect HTs in third-party digital IP cores. The proposed framework combines flip-flop level and combinational logic level feature analysis to achieve both high efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that both explicitly and implicitly triggered HTs can be detected in very short time with a negligible false positive rate. More importantly, our framework has the unique advantage of being scalable to defend against future and stealthier HTs by adding new features into the framework.},

abstract={The explosive rise of intelligent devices with ubiquitous connectivity have dramatically increased Internet of Things (IoT) traffic in the cloud environment and created potential attack surfaces for cyber-attacks. Traditional security approaches are insufficient and inefficient to address security threats in cloud-based IoT networks. In this vein, software defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and machine learning techniques introduce numerous advantages that can effectively resolve cybersecurity matters for cloud-based IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a collaborative and intelligent network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture, namely SeArch for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. It composes a hierarchical layer of intelligent IDS nodes working in collaboration to detect anomalies and formulate policy into the SDN-based IoT gateway devices to stop malicious traffic as fast as possible. We first describe a new NIDS architecture with a comprehensive analysis in terms of the system resource and path selection optimizations. Next, the system process logic is extensively investigated through main consecutive procedures, including initialization, runtime operation, and database update. Afterward, we conduct a detailed implementation of the proposed solution in an SDN-based environment and perform a variety of experiments. Finally, evaluation results of the SeArch architecture yield outstanding performance in anomaly detection and mitigation as well as bottleneck problem handling in the SDN-based cloud IoT networks in comparison with existing solutions.},

abstract={The integration of WiFi fingerprint-based indoor positioning technology and big data analysis emerges as a new research prospect. Through the analysis of big data collected from users' submission, we can discover many other applications of fingerprint positioning. A popular application is the check-in to point of interest (POI) for its crowd traffic evaluation according to the volume of received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints submitted by users. However, this crowd traffic evaluation method may be susceptible to the intrusion of malicious check-in behaviors. Attackers who are not at the target POI submit the self-modification RSS fingerprints that can be located at the target POI in order to illegally increase its crowd traffic. To this end, we propose a malicious check-in defense scheme based on the access point (AP) selection to resist attackers who aim to successfully initiate the fingerprint modification. Specifically, the distance between different POIs in fingerprint space is firstly developed for AP selection. Then, in order to increase the robustness of selected AP subset, we propose the mutual information among different classes as a selection condition. Through the multiobjective optimization and Pareto optimality, we can obtain the best AP subset to participate in the computation of positioning algorithm. Furthermore, the optimal modified fingerprint is searched by the level set method (LSM), which can be utilized to measure the costs of attackers and the robustness of the system. In addition, we propose an iterative weight updating method based on classification error to learn the optimal weight in order to balance the positioning accuracy and robustness. We finally carry out extensive simulations to validate that the POI crowd traffic can be assessed in terms of the RSS fingerprint-related information and our proposed scheme can perform high robustness to resist malicious check-in.},

pages={34885-34899},
abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) offers a novel paradigm for effective network management by decoupling the control plane from the data plane thereby allowing a high level of manageability and programmability. However, the notion of a centralized controller becomes a bottleneck by opening up a host of vulnerabilities to various types of attacks. One of the most harmful, stealthy, and easy to launch attacks against networked systems is the link flooding attack (LFA). In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of the SDN control layer to LFA and how the attack strategy differs when targeting traditional networks which primarily involves attacking the links directly. In LFA, the attacker employs bots to surreptitiously send low rate legitimate traffic on the control channel which ultimately results in disconnecting control plane from the data plane. Mitigating LFA on the control channel remains a challenge in the network security paradigm with the use of network traffic filtering only. To address this challenge, we propose CyberPulse, a novel effective countermeasure, underpinning a machine learning-based classifier to alleviate LFA in SDN. CyberPulse performs network surveillance by classifying network traffic using deep learning techniques and is implemented as an extension module in the Floodlight controller. CyberPulse was evaluated for its accuracy, false positive rate, and effectiveness as compared to competing approaches on realistic networks generated using Mininet. The results show that CyberPulse can classify malicious flows with high accuracy and mitigate them effectively.},

abstract={Adversarial examples that fool machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have been a topic of intense research interest, with attacks and defenses being developed in a tight back-and-forth. Most past defenses are best effort and have been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Recently a set of certified defenses have been introduced, which provide guarantees of robustness to norm-bounded attacks. However these defenses either do not scale to large datasets or are limited in the types of models they can support. This paper presents the first certified defense that both scales to large networks and datasets (such as Google's Inception network for ImageNet) and applies broadly to arbitrary model types. Our defense, called PixelDP, is based on a novel connection between robustness against adversarial examples and differential privacy, a cryptographically-inspired privacy formalism, that provides a rigorous, generic, and flexible foundation for defense.},

abstract={The ever-increasing demands of vehicular networks pose significant challenges such as availability, computation complexity, security, trust, authentication, etc. This becomes even more complicated for high-speed moving vehicles. As a result, increasing the capacity of these networks has been attracting considerable awareness. In this regard, the next generation of cellular networks, 5G, is expected to be a promising solution enabling high data rates, capacity, and quality of service as well as low latency communications. However, 5G networks still face challenges in providing ubiquitous and reliable connections among high-speed vehicles. Thus, to overcome the gaps in the existing solutions, we propose a software defined network (SDN)-based consolidated framework providing end-to-end security and privacy in 5G enabled vehicular networks. The framework simplifies network management through SDN, while achieving optimized network communications. It operates in two phases: first, an elliptic curve cryptographic based authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate the cluster heads and certificate authority in SDN-based vehicular setups, and, second, an intrusion detection module supported by tensor based dimensionality reduction is designed to reduce the computational complexity and identify the potential intrusions in the network. In order to assess the performance of the proposed framework, an extensive evaluation is performed on three simulators; NS3, SUMO, and SPAN. To harness the potential benefits of the proposed model, the first module, is evaluated on the basis of security features, whereas the second module is evaluated, and compared with the existing state-of-the-art models, on the basis of detection rate, false positive rate, accuracy, detection time, and communication overhead. The simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed framework as compared to the existing models.},

abstract={Anomaly detection-based spoof attack detection is a recent development in face Presentation Attack Detection (fPAD), where a spoof detector is learned using only non-attacked images of users. These detectors are of practical importance as they are shown to generalize well to new attack types. In this paper, we present a deep-learning solution for anomaly detection-based spoof attack detection where both classifier and feature representations are learned together end-to-end. First, we introduce a pseudo-negative class during training in the absence of attacked images. The pseudo-negative class is modeled using a Gaussian distribution whose mean is calculated by a weighted running mean. Secondly, we use pairwise confusion loss to further regularize the training process. The proposed approach benefits from the representation learning power of the CNNs and learns better features for fPAD task as shown in our ablation study. We perform extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets: Replay-Attack, Rose-Youtu, OULU-NPU and Spoof in Wild to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the previous methods.

abstract={The underlying theme of this paper is to explore the various facets of power systems data through the lens of graph signal processing (GSP), laying down the foundations of the Grid-GSP framework. Grid-GSP provides an interpretation for the spatio-temporal properties of voltage phasor measurements, by showing how the well-known power systems modeling supports a generative low-pass graph filter model for the state variables, namely the voltage phasors. Using the model we formalize the empirical observation that voltage phasor measurement data lie in a low-dimensional subspace and tie their spatio-temporal structure to generator voltage dynamics. The Grid-GSP generative model is then successfully employed to investigate the problems, pertaining to the grid, of data sampling and interpolation, network inference, detection of anomalies and data compression. Numerical results on a large synthetic grid that mimics the real-grid of the state of Texas, ACTIVSg2000, and on real-world measurements from ISO-New England verify the efficacy of applying Grid-GSP methods to electric grid data.},

abstract={Adversarial attacks have been the hot research field in artificial intelligence security. Decision-based black-box adversarial attacks are much more appropriate in the real-world scenarios, where only the final decisions of the targeted deep neural networks are accessible. However, since there is no available guidance for searching the imperceptive adversarial perturbation, boundary attack, one of the best performing decision-based black-box attacks, carries out computationally expensive search. For improving attack efficiency, we propose a novel black box explanation guided decision-based black-box adversarial attack. Firstly, the problem of decision-based adversarial attacks is modeled as a derivative-free and constraint optimization problem. To solve this optimization problem, the black box explanation guided constrained random search method is proposed to more quickly find the imperceptible adversarial example. The insights into the targeted deep neural networks explored by the black box explanation are fully used to accelerate the computationally expensive random search. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed attack improves the attack efficiency by 64% compared with boundary attack.},

In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities of a state-of-the-art face recognition system based on template reconstruction attack. We propose a neighborly de-convolutional neural network (NbNet) to reconstruct face images from their deep templates. In our experiments, we assumed that no knowledge about the target subject and the deep network are available. To train the NbNet reconstruction models, we augmented two benchmark face datasets (VGG-Face and Multi-PIE) with a large collection of images synthesized using a face generator. The proposed reconstruction was evaluated using type-I (comparing the reconstructed images against the original face images used to generate the deep template) and type-II (comparing the reconstructed images against a different face image of the same subject) attacks. Given the images reconstructed from NbNets, we show that for verification, we achieve TAR of 95.20 percent (58.05 percent) on LFW under type-I (type-II) attacks @ FAR of 0.1 percent. Besides, 96.58 percent (92.84 percent) of the images reconstructed from templates of partition fa (fb) can be identified from partition fa in color FERET. Our study demonstrates the need to secure deep templates in face recognition systems.},

abstract={Recently, cybercrime has become an important research issue in the field of cybersecurity. And ransomware is considered one of the main categories of cybercrime. The Wannacry ransomware attack broken out in 2017 is one of the largest ransomware attacks in history, creating huge threats to the data security of individual users and enterprises. Since 2017, although the principle of Wannacry has been figured comprehensively and numerous detection and defense methods have been proposed, all of these existing methods have some defects. Therefore, we propose to build a comprehensive detection approach of Wannacry with a set of rules, which is named Comprehensive Wannacry Detection Rules (CWDR). Through principle analysis, we extract the traffic features. And these features can be easily distinguished from other normal traffic information during the Wannacry attack. Base on these traffic features, a set of rules is designed to detect the attack process of Wannacry. CWDR rule set can detect Wannacry at all 8 stages through network traffic monitoring. Finally, we instantiate the rule set using Suricata and do benchmark experiments with ET Open rule set and Snort rule set. In the basic experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 0%, 25%, 50%. In the evasion experiment, the False Negative Rate of the CWDR rule set, ET Open rule set, and Snort rule set are 12.5%, 75%, 62.5%. The results show that the CWDR rule set can detect the attack process of Wannacry ransomware more precisely.},

abstract={Bitcoin is gaining traction as an alternative store of value. Its market capitalization transcends all other cryptocurrencies in the market. But its high monetary value also makes it an attractive target to cyber criminal actors. Hacking campaigns usually target an ecosystem’s weakest points. In Bitcoin, the exchange platforms are one of them. Each exchange breach is a threat not only to direct victims, but to the credibility of Bitcoin’s entire ecosystem. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is subpar compared to other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. Furthermore we show that overall security posture has improved, but still has major flaws. To discover adversarial methods post-breach, we have analyzed two cases of BTC laundering. Through this analysis we provide insight into how exchange platforms with lax cyber security even further increase the intermediary risk introduced by them into the Bitcoin ecosystem.},

abstract={Blockchain is a technology that ensures data security by verifying database of records established in a decentralized and distributed network. Blockchain-based approaches have been applied to secure data in the fields of the Internet of Things, software engineering, healthcare systems, financial services, and smart power grids. However, the security of the blockchain system is still a major concern. We took the initiative to present a systematic study which sheds light on what defensive strategies are used to secure the blockchain system effectively. Specifically, we focus on blockchain data security that aims to mitigate the two data consistency attacks: double-spend attack and selfish mining attack. We employed the systematic approach to analyze a total of 40 selected studies using the proposed taxonomy of defensive strategies: monitoring, alert forwarding, alert broadcasting, inform, detection, and conceptual research design. It presents a comparison framework for existing and future research on blockchain security. Finally, some recommendations are proposed for blockchain researchers and developers.},

pages={17-20},
abstract={Deep brain stimulation, as a primary surgical treatment for various neurological disorders, involves implanting electrodes to stimulate target nuclei within millimeter accuracy. Accurate pre-operative target selection is challenging due to the poor contrast in its surrounding region in MR images. In this paper, we present a learning-based method to automatically and rapidly localize the target using multi-modal images. A learning-based technique is applied first to spatially normalize the images in a common coordinate space. Given a point in this space, we extract a heterogeneous set of features that capture spatial and intensity contextual patterns at different scales in each image modality. Regression forests are used to learn a displacement vector of this point to the target. The target is predicted as a weighted aggregation of votes from various test samples, leading to a robust and accurate solution. We conduct five-fold cross validation using 100 subjects and compare our method to three indirect targeting methods, a state-of-the-art statistical atlas-based approach, and two variations of our method that use only a single modality image. With an overall error of 2.63±1.37mm, our method improves upon the single modality-based variations and statistically significantly outperforms the indirect targeting ones. Our technique matches state-of-the-art registration methods but operates on completely different principles. Both techniques can be used in tandem in processing pipelines operating on large databases or in the clinical flow for automated error detection.},

year={2021},
volume={8},

pages={4353-4372},
abstract={Trending topic recommendation (TTR) has become a popular social service for social users to obtain interesting topics based on public social content. Due to sensitive privacy, the traditional differential privacy (DP) methods are used to protect social contents. However, these DP methods rely on a fully trusted third party (TTP) without considering protecting the correlations of social keywords, and do not support the privacy-preserving online social content publication. In this article, we propose a novel local DP-based TTR (LDPTR) scheme to perform high-quality online TTR services while achieving local privacy-preserving social contents. Specifically, LDPTR first clusters the social keywords with high correlations into noisy graph classes based on a graph-based LDP (GLDP) algorithm for ensuring the keyword correlation privacy. Second, LDPTR adopts a novel mechanism called ∈2-compressive sensing indistinguishability (CSI) to generate noisy social topics, thereby preventing the user-linkage attack and breaking the curse of high-dimensional local differential privacy (LDP). Then, a dynamic graph-based CSI (DGCSI) algorithm is proposed to protect the online social content privacy while ensuring data usability. Furthermore, LDPTR calculates the trending topics of interest with high burstiness by using a topic distribution similarity model-based topic burstiness (TMTB) algorithm, which achieves effective TTR services. Our LDPTR scheme satisfies ∈-LDP by detailed security analysis. Extensive experiments over two real-world data sets show that the proposed LDPTR gets high data utility while ensuring high-level privacy.},

abstract={In the recent literature, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used to detect the abnormal behaviour for different applications. Recently, these applications have moved to the cloud and virtualized environments due to the unique benefits such as deployment agility, scalability, flexibility and resiliency. However, those benefits pose a new challenge for classical ML approaches to accurately identify abnormal behaviours due to their highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature. In this paper, we propose a new approach Malchain for profiling virtual applications based on using a new concept: microservice role. The roles are used to provide a consistent view of the virtual application addressing the mentioned new challenges. The microservice data exchange graph built using this consistent view is then used to extract features providing the appropriate measures to profile the aggregated behaviour of the microservices comprising a virtual application. We show the efficiency and feasibility of our approach by implementing several different real-world attacks, and measuring high detection rates (86%-99%) for those attacks.},

Haar classifier is trained for autonomously detecting MAV in open scenes, like grasslands or obstruct-free playgrounds. In order to increase the robustness of the detection, a Kaiman filter has been employed to conduct image tracking. Contours of detected MAV have been extracted for shape matching. Point sets quantized from contours match with the given point sets using Hungarian algorithm and relaxation labeling based on shape contexts. Two techniques, affine and thin plate spline (TPS) transformation, are explored, while TPS is better in dealing with distorted shapes. In experiments, we develop and implement an innovative 2D shape-based pose estimation method by using only one monocular camera which results in fast and accurate performances.},

abstract={This work uses statistical classification techniques to learn about the different network behavior patterns demonstrated by targeted malware and generic malware. Targeted malware is a recent type of threat, involving bespoke software that has been created to target a specific victim. It is considered a more dangerous threat than generic malware, because a targeted attack can cause more serious damage to the victim. Our work aims to automatically distinguish between the network activity generated by the two types of malware, which then allows samples of malware to be classified as being either targeted or generic. For a network administrator, such knowledge can be important because it assists to understand which threats require particular attention. Because a network administrator usually manages more than an alarm simultaneously, the aim of the work is particularly relevant. We set up a sandbox and infected virtual machines with malware, recording all resulting malware activity on the network. Using the network packets produced by the malware samples, we extract features to classify their behavior. Before performing classification, we carefully analyze the features and the dataset to study all their details and gain a deeper understanding of the malware under study. Our use of statistical classifiers is shown to give excellent results in some cases, where we achieved an accuracy of almost 96% in distinguishing between the two types of malware. We can conclude that the network behaviors of the two types of malicious code are very different.},

abstract={The main intention of this paper is to build an automatic computer aided hand gesture to voice conversion system for people suffering from Aphonia, a medical term for speech impairment. We have assumed the input gesture images given to the system as simple and complex depending on the background of the image. A novel contour based image segmentation algorithm is proposed in this paper to detect the boundary of the foreground from images with simple dark background. The traditional GrabCut algorithm is employed for segmentation of foreground from images with complex background. This algorithm iteratively segments the image to extract the foreground accurately. The American Sign Language (ASL) 26 finger-spelled alphabet images are taken as the dataset for the two above mentioned algorithms. For the dataset that we have generated, it is observed from the results that contour based segmentation algorithm provides absolutely perfect results. The number of iterations required for GrabCut algorithm to segment the foreground may vary from image to image depending on the background. Out of all the 26 gesture of alphabets, Q, R and S need 6 number of iterations at maximum. A minimum of 1 iteration is required for alphabets E, J and O. On an average, 3 iterations of GrabCut algorithm is required to completely segment the foreground from images with complex background.},

abstract={Probabilistic methods for point set registration have interesting theoretical properties, such as linear complexity in the number of used points, and they easily generalize to joint registration of multiple point sets. In this work, we improve their recognition performance to match state of the art. This is done by incorporating learned features, by adding a von Mises-Fisher feature model in each mixture component, and by using learned attention weights. We learn these jointly using a registration loss learning strategy (RLL) that directly uses the registration error as a loss, by back-propagating through the registration iterations. This is possible as the probabilistic registration is fully differentiable, and the result is a learning framework that is truly end-to-end. We perform extensive experiments on the 3DMatch and Kitti datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our approach benefits significantly from the integration of the learned features and our learning strategy, outperforming the state-of-the-art on Kitti.

abstract={Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical components. Unlike the program bytecode whose vulnerabilities and threats have been widely-discussed, whether and how the deep learning models deployed in the applications can be compromised are not well-understood since Neural Networks are usually viewed as a black box. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical backdoor attack achieved with a set of reverse-engineering techniques over compiled deep learning models. The core of the attack is a neural conditional branch constructed with a trigger detector and several operators and injected into the victim model as a malicious payload. The attack is effective as the conditional logic can be flexibly customized by the attacker, and scalable as it does not require any prior knowledge from the original model. We evaluated the attack effectiveness using 5 state-of-the-art deep learning models and real-world samples collected from 30 users. The results demonstrated that the injected backdoor can be triggered with a success rate of 93.5%, while only brought less than 2ms latency overhead and no more than 1.4% accuracy decrease. We further conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play. We found 54 apps that were vulnerable to our attack, including popular and security-critical ones. The results call for the awareness of deep learning application developers and auditors to enhance the protection of deployed models.},

abstract={Adversarial examples can cause catastrophic mistakes in Deep Neural Network (DNNs) based vision systems e.g., for classification, segmentation and object detection. The vulnerability of DNNs against such attacks can prove a major roadblock towards their real-world deployment. Transferability of adversarial examples demand generalizable defenses that can provide cross-task protection. Adversarial training that enhances robustness by modifying target model's parameters lacks such generalizability. On the other hand, different input processing based defenses fall short in the face of continuously evolving attacks. In this paper, we take the first step to combine the benefits of both approaches and propose a self-supervised adversarial training mechanism in the input space. By design, our defense is a generalizable approach and provides significant robustness against the unseen adversarial attacks (e.g. by reducing the success rate of translation-invariant ensemble attack from 82.6% to 31.9% in comparison to previous stateof-the-art). It can be deployed as a plug-and-play solution to protect a variety of vision systems, as we demonstrate for the case of classification, segmentation and detection.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) popularity and complexity has grown at an accelerating rate. As a result, IoT security is more critical than ever before. Many services attempt to simplify the bottlenecks of IoT infrastructure, development and deployment which previously fell to developers. However, these services are often proprietary and insecure. In this paper, we explore an alternative IoT service model that uses Docker to securely bootstrap an IoT network running on 3 Raspberry Pis. This service uses containerization technology with Linux to abstract architectural details, software update mechanisms, and network security away from the developer. Devices authenticate and communicate with a remote server using private key cryptography, while OTA updates are delivered via the Docker registry. We show that this model satisfies modern security standards of lightweight technology and fulfills expectations of a deployment platform.},

abstract={Existing systems for 3-D reconstruction from multiple view video use controlled indoor environments with uniform illumination and backgrounds to allow accurate segmentation of dynamic foreground objects. In this paper, we present a portable system for 3-D reconstruction of dynamic outdoor scenes that require relatively large capture volumes with complex backgrounds and nonuniform illumination. This is motivated by the demand for 3-D reconstruction of natural outdoor scenes to support film and broadcast production. Limitations of existing multiple view 3-D reconstruction techniques for use in outdoor scenes are identified. Outdoor 3-D scene reconstruction is performed in three stages: 1) 3-D background scene modeling using spherical stereo image capture; 2) multiple view segmentation of dynamic foreground objects by simultaneous video matting across multiple views; and 3) robust 3-D foreground reconstruction and multiple view segmentation refinement in the presence of segmentation and calibration errors. Evaluation is performed on several outdoor productions with complex dynamic scenes including people and animals. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach overcomes limitations of previous indoor multiple view reconstruction approaches enabling high-quality free-viewpoint rendering and 3-D reference models for production.},

pages={2244-2255},
abstract={In this paper, we consider a new insider threat for the privacy preserving work of distributed kernel-based data mining (DKBDM), such as distributed support vector machine. Among several known data breaching problems, those associated with insider attacks have been rising significantly, making this one of the fastest growing types of security breaches. Once considered a negligible concern, insider attacks have risen to be one of the top three central data violations. Insider-related research involving the distribution of kernel-based data mining is limited, resulting in substantial vulnerabilities in designing protection against collaborative organizations. Prior works often fall short by addressing a multifactorial model that is more limited in scope and implementation than addressing insiders within an organization colluding with outsiders. A faulty system allows collusion to go unnoticed when an insider shares data with an outsider, who can then recover the original data from message transmissions (intermediary kernel values) among organizations. This attack requires only accessibility to a few data entries within the organizations rather than requiring the encrypted administrative privileges typically found in the distribution of data mining scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this new insider threat in DKBDM. We also analytically demonstrate the minimum amount of insider data necessary to launch the insider attack. Finally, we follow up by introducing several proposed privacy-preserving schemes to counter the described attack.},

abstract={Malware is one of the biggest threats in cloud computing. Malware running inside virtual machines or containers could steal critical information or continue to attack other cloud nodes. To detect malware in cloud, especially zero-day malware, signature-and machine-learning-based approaches are proposed to analyze the execution binary. However, malicious binary files may not permanently be stored in the file system of virtual machine or container, periodically scanner may not find the target files. Dynamic analysis approach usually introduce run-time overhead to virtual machines, which is not widely used in cloud. To solve these problems, we propose a memory analysis approach to detect malware, employing the deep learning technology. The system analyzes the memory image periodically during malware execution, which will not introduce run-time overhead. We first extract the memory snapshot from running virtual machines or containers. Then, the snapshot is converted to a grayscale image. Finally, we employ CNN to detect malware. In the learning phase, malicious and benign software are trained. In the testing phase, we test our system with real-world malwares.},

abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a new networking paradigm that can provide fine-grained network management service. Since the SDN controller makes control decision for the network, it becomes the main target of denial of service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose BWManager to mitigateE which mainly consists mitigate the DoS attacks on the SDN controller with BWManager that mainly consists of four key components: 1) simplified DoS detection module; 2) forecasting engine; 3) priority manager; and 4) scheduler. The simplified DoS detection module calculates a comprehensive judgment score for each switch, which indicates the attacking severity of each switch and is used to decide time slice allocation of the controller. The forecasting engine is the basis of the controller scheduling method and forecasts the bandwidth consumption of users to determine the users' trust values. The trust values are used by the priority manager to manage multiple buffer queues with different priorities for the users. The scheduler protects the controller and the normal users under DoS attacks by running a weighted Round-Robin algorithm to process flow requests in different priority queues. We evaluate the performance and overhead of BWManager in both hardware and software OpenFlow environments. The results demonstrate that BWManager is effective with a limited overhead.},

abstract={In recent years, the number of images shared online has continuously grown. The forensics community has kept the pace by developing techniques to both reliably extract information from these images, but also to remove it. In particular, the latest developments in image anonymization methods exposes an attack vector when used by skilled ill-intentioned image producers that may want to elude prosecution. We present an approach to detect whether or not an image has undergone a laundering process, i.e., it has been tampered with so that its unique characterizing features have been changed to avoid detection. We focus on the photo response non uniformity (PRNU) noise unique to every imaging sensor, and we consider that an image has been "laundered" when we detect the absence of PRNU from an image. We propose a per image preprocessing pipeline that generates information-rich features later used as input of fine-tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We study the performance of the proposed approach using various CNN architectures and blind anonymization techniques and show its effectiveness under several training and testing scenarios. Our results also show that CNN models trained with the proposed feature are capable of generalizing over unseen devices and are robust against non-geometric transformations.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates the integration between objects and different sensors to provide communication among them without human intervention. However, the extensive demand for IoT and its various applications has continued to grow, coupled with the need to achieve foolproof security requirements. IoT produces a vast amount of data under several constraints such as low processor, power, and memory. These constraints, along with the invaluable data produced by IoT devices, make IoT vulnerable to various security attacks. This paper presents an overview of IoT, its well-known system architecture, enabling technologies, and discusses security challenges and goals. Furthermore, we analyze security vulnerabilities and provide state-of-the-art security taxonomy. The taxonomy of the most relevant and current IoT security attacks is presented for application, network, and physical layers. While most other surveys studied one of the areas of security measures, this study considers and reports on the most advanced security countermeasures within the areas of autonomic, encryption, and learning-based approaches. Additionally, we uncover security challenges that may be met by the research community regarding security implementation in heterogeneous IoT environment. Finally, we provide different visions about possible security solutions and future research directions.},

Thus, in this article, we design an approach using advanced deep learning to detect cyber attacks against IoT systems. Specifically, our approach integrates a set of long short-term memory (LSTM) modules into an ensemble of detectors. These modules are then merged using a decision tree to arrive at an aggregated output at the final stage. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using a real-world data set of Modbus network traffic and obtain an accuracy rate of over 99% in the detection of cyber attacks against IoT devices.},

abstract={On-body devices are an intrinsic part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) vision to provide human-centric services. These on-body IoT devices are largely embedded devices that lack a sophisticated user interface to facilitate traditional pre-shared key-based security protocols. Motivated by this real-world security vulnerability, this paper proposes SecureTag, a system designed to add defense in depth against active attacks by integrating physical layer (PHY) information with upper-layer protocols. The underpinning of SecureTag is a signal processing technique that extracts the peculiar propagation characteristics of creeping waves to discern on-body devices. Upon overhearing a suspicious transmission, SecureTag initiates a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to mitigate attacks. We implement our system on different commercial off-the-shelf wearables and a smartphone. Extensive experiments are conducted in a lab, apartments, malls, and outdoor areas, involving 12 volunteer subjects of different age groups, to demonstrate the robustness of our system. Results show that our system can mitigate 96.13 % of active attack attempts while triggering false alarms on merely 5.64 % of legitimate traffic.},

abstract={Intrusion Detection (ID) is essential for protecting contemporary computer networks from a range of threats. Modern ID techniques must cope with increasingly sophisticated attacks as well as rapidly rising network line speeds. Signature based ID is forced to sample sparsely, increasing the likelihood of malicious traffic entering the network without scrutiny. Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a "repuation" system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity. Furthermore, each system design includes the development of an innovative classifier that uses multi objective evolutionary algorithms to aid in the search for effective operational parameter values. Evaluation using an extensive agent simulation framework highlights the conditions under which the reputation system provides a significant classification benefit.},

abstract={Machine learning models, including deep neural networks, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial samples are crafted from legitimate inputs by carefully introducing small perturbation to the input so that the classifier is fooled. Adversarial retraining, which involves retraining the classifier using adversarial samples, has been shown to improve the robustness of the classifier against adversarial attacks. However, it has been also shown that retraining with too many samples can lead to performance degradation. Hence, a careful selection of the adversarial samples that are used to retrain the classifier is necessary, yet existing works select these samples in a randomized fashion. In our work, we propose two novel approaches for selecting adversarial samples: based on the distance from cluster center of malware and based on the probability derived from a kernel based learning (KBL). Our experiment results show that both of our selective mechanisms for adversarial retraining outperform the random selection technique and significantly improve the classifier performance against adversarial attacks. In particular, selection with KBL delivers above 6% improvement in detection accuracy compared to random selection. The method proposed here has greater impact in designing robust machine learning system for security applications.},

abstract={Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) has a great potential in fully utilizing the scarce spectrum resources, and heterogeneous two-tier network has been regarded as one major solution for achieving it. Without privacy protection in operation-time, however, the primary users will be reluctant to share their spectrum with secondary users. In this paper, we present PriDSS in two-tier wireless networks, the first scheme for the administrator of a dynamic spectrum sharing system to select secondary users in a differentially operation-time private manner. First, we describe the operation-time inference attacks on the traditional secondary users auction without privacy. Then, we bring up a ranking metric to quantify the administrator's preference for secondary users. Moreover, based on the exponential mechanism, we calculate the probability of each secondary user being selected as a winner through the ranking metric. Finally, a truthful payment method is designed according to that probability. Extensively theoretical analysis and evaluations show that PriDSS can simultaneously achieve truthfulness, approximate social welfare maximization, and differential operation-time privacy.},

In order to solve this problem, this study analyzes and summarizes the latest research results by investigating a large number of the latest domestic and international academic papers, summarizing malware detection architecture and detection schemes, and analyzing existing problems and challenges. This review will help researchers better understand the research status and future research directions in this field.},

abstract={Real-time crowdsourced maps, such as Waze provide timely updates on traffic, congestion, accidents, and points of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate how lack of strong location authentication allows creation of software-based Sybil devices that expose crowdsourced map systems to a variety of security and privacy attacks. Our experiments show that a single Sybil device with limited resources can cause havoc on Waze, reporting false congestion and accidents and automatically rerouting user traffic. More importantly, we describe techniques to generate Sybil devices at scale, creating armies of virtual vehicles capable of remotely tracking precise movements for large user populations while avoiding detection. To defend against Sybil devices, we propose a new approach based on co-location edges, authenticated records that attest to the one-time physical co-location of a pair of devices. Over time, co-location edges combine to form large proximity graphs that attest to physical interactions between devices, allowing scalable detection of virtual vehicles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using large-scale simulations, and how they can be used to dramatically reduce the impact of the attacks. We have informed Waze/Google team of our research findings. Currently, we are in active collaboration with Waze team to improve the security and privacy of their system.},

abstract={While a large amount of work exists in the literature relating to place/location recognition, very few of these provide a robust way of dealing with large amounts of lighting changes in locations of interest. In this paper, we address the problem under the additional constraint that a pose estimate from the current location of the camera to the reference location is to be estimated. This requires robust feature matching to estimate corresponding points, and not just image-level matching, as is often done in the literature. We present a method to learn a matching function from training data that is representative of the lighting variations to be modeled, under weak assumptions. Lighting variation in the image descriptors is modeled using a probability distribution on the discretized descriptor space. Results are presented on a live visual SLAM system in outdoor environments and in an indoor simulated environment, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

pages={7002-7017},
abstract={The majority of current attacks on reduced-round variants of block ciphers seeks to maximize the number of rounds that can be broken, using less data than the entire codebook and less time than exhaustive key search. In this paper, we pursue a different approach, restricting the data available to the adversary to a few plaintext/ciphertext pairs. We argue that consideration of such attacks (which received little attention in recent years) improves our understanding of the security of block ciphers and of other cryptographic primitives based on block ciphers. In particular, these attacks can be leveraged to more complex attacks, either on the block cipher itself or on other primitives (e.g., stream ciphers, MACs, or hash functions) that use a small number of rounds of the block cipher as one of their components. As a case study, we consider the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-the most widely used block cipher. The AES round function is used in many cryptographic primitives, such as the hash functions Lane, SHAvite-3, and Vortex or the message authentication codes ALPHA-MAC, Pelican, and Marvin. We present attacks on up to four rounds of AES that require at most three known/chosen plaintexts. We then apply these attacks to cryptanalyze an AES-based stream cipher (which follows the leak extraction methodology), and to mount the best known plaintext attack on six-round AES.},

abstract={Deep learning-based person re-identification (Re-ID) has made great progress and achieved high performance recently. In this paper, we make the first attempt to examine the vulnerability of current person Re-ID models against a dangerous attack method, i.e., the universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) attack, which has been shown to fool classification models with a little overhead. We propose a more universal adversarial perturbation (MUAP) method for both image-agnostic and model-insensitive person Re-ID attack. Firstly, we adopt a list-wise attack objective function to disrupt the similarity ranking list directly. Secondly, we propose a model-insensitive mechanism for cross-model attack. Extensive experiments show that the proposed attack approach achieves high attack performance and outperforms other state of the arts by large margin in cross-model scenario. The results also demonstrate the vulnerability of current Re-ID models to MUAP and further suggest the need of designing more robust Re-ID models.},

abstract={In the last decade, researchers, practitioners and companies struggled for devising mechanisms to detect cyber-security threats. Among others, those efforts originated rule-based, signature-based or supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that were proven effective for detecting those intrusions that have already been encountered and characterized. Instead, new unknown threats, often referred to as zero-day attacks or zero-days, likely go undetected as they are often misclassified by those techniques. In recent years, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms showed potential to detect zero-days. However, dedicated support for quantitative analyses of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms is still scarce and often does not promote meta-learning, which has potential to improve classification performance. To such extent, this paper introduces the problem of zero-days and reviews unsupervised algorithms for their detection. Then, the paper applies a question-answer approach to identify typical issues in conducting quantitative analyses for zero-days detection, and shows how to setup and exercise unsupervised algorithms with appropriate tooling. Using a very recent attack dataset, we debate on i) the impact of features on the detection performance of unsupervised algorithms, ii) the relevant metrics to evaluate intrusion detectors, iii) means to compare multiple unsupervised algorithms, iv) the application of meta-learning to reduce misclassifications. Ultimately, v) we measure detection performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms with respect to zero-days. Overall, the paper exemplifies how to practically orchestrate and apply an appropriate methodology, process and tool, providing even non-experts with means to select appropriate strategies to deal with zero-days.},

Due to its extensive use in everyday life, it has many applications such as social media (Face book, WhatsApp, messenger etc.,) and other online applications such as online businesses, e-counseling, advertisement on websites, e-banking, e-hunting websites, e-doctor appointment and e-doctor opinion. The above mentioned applications of internet technology makes things very easy and accessible for human being in limited time, however, this technology is vulnerable to various security threats. A vital and severe threat associated with this technology or a particular application is “Phishing attack” which is used by attacker to usurp the network security.

abstract={Low-rate Denial of Service (LDoS) attack exploiting vulnerabilities of TCP protocol for periodic attacks usually results in the degradation of service quality. Its short attack duration and low average attack traffic make it highly efficient and concealed. Existing detection methods against this type of attack still have a shortcoming that the accuracy is not so satisfactory. A method for detecting LDoS attacks using PSO and k-means algorithm is proposed in this paper. The method first divides the detection time into multiple detection units, samples the traffic data of the data stream and summarizes the traffic characteristics in each detection unit, and then it uses the K-means algorithm to calculate the clustering center. In order to conduct a better detection, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to perturb the clustering center to avoid the defect that the K-means algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal solution. Finally, the network features after clustering are compared with the anomalous features generated after the LDoS attacks, and the relevant criteria is adopted to judge and subsequently verify the LDoS attacks. The experiments are carried out on multiple platforms and public datasets such as NS2 platform, test-bed platform, DARPA dataset, LBNL dataset and WIDE2018 dataset. The results of comparative experiments show that the proposed method has a better performance in effectively detecting LDoS attacks.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on many challenging machine learning tasks. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs generated by adding maliciously crafted perturbations to the benign inputs. As a growing number of attacks have been reported to generate adversarial inputs of varying sophistication, the defense-attack arms race has been accelerated. In this paper, we present MODEF, a cross-layer model diversity ensemble framework. MODEF intelligently combines unsupervised model denoising ensemble with supervised model verification ensemble by quantifying model diversity, aiming to boost the robustness of the target model against adversarial examples. Evaluated using eleven representative attacks on popular benchmark datasets, we show that MODEF achieves remarkable defense success rates, compared with existing defense methods, and provides a superior capability of repairing adversarial inputs and making correct predictions with high accuracy in the presence of black-box attacks.},

abstract={Global network security is facing more and more serious challenges. Existing traditional network security defense tools (e.g. firewalls, intrusion prevention systems) cannot actively adjust defense strategies and conduct targeted defenses according to change of current network environment threats (e.g. attack intensity, attack type, etc.), which has greater passiveness and blindness. Inspired by artificial immunity, this paper proposes an immune-based dynamic risk control system. The system consists of intrusion detection module, risk assessment and dynamic risk control module. The system obtains the current system environment's risk level through intrusion detection and risk assessment module, selects the targeted defense strategy from the strategy knowledge database according to the risk level, implements positive and active defense strategies, and then controls targeted risks of different types and levels to prevent the spread of the attack. Compared with the classic intrusion prevention system, of which once the rules are set, it will remain unchanged and cannot be dynamically adjusted, the system adopts different control strategies for different risk of network, and the control strategy can be flexibly and dynamically adjusted according to the change of network threat. The extended active and passive control methods enhance the systems capability to handle different types of attacks and the risk level. Thus, it is flexible, active and targeted to control the risk of network security.},

To protect video chats against fake facial videos, we propose a new defense system to significantly raise the bar for face reenactment-assisted attacks. Compared with existing works, our system has three major strengths. First, our system does not require extra hardware or intense computational resources. Second, it follows the normal video chat process and does not significantly degrade the user experience. Third, our system does not need to collect training data from attackers and new users, which means it can be quickly launched on new devices. We developed a prototype and conducted comprehensive evaluations. Experimental results show that our system can provide an average true acceptance rate of at least 92.5% for legitimate users and reject the attacker with mean accuracy of at least 94.4% for a single detection.},

In this paper, we investigate factors for accurate, reliable, and resource-efficient object and pose recognition suitable for robotic manipulation in adversarial clutter. Our exploration is in the context of a three-stage pipeline of discriminative CNN-based recognition, generative probabilistic estimation, and robot manipulation. This pipeline proposes using a SAmpling Network Density filter, or SAND filter, to recover from potentially erroneous decisions produced by a CNN through generative probabilistic inference. We present experimental results from SAND filter perception for robotic manipulation in tabletop scenes with both benign and adversarial clutter. These experiments vary CNN model complexity for object recognition and evaluate levels of inaccuracy that can be recovered by generative pose inference. This scenario is extended to consider adversarial environmental modifications with varied lighting, occlusions, and surface modifications.},

abstract={In this paper, optimal attack schemes against load frequency control (LFC) are studied by considering coordinated attack. By attacking sensor measurement (load) simultaneously, the attacker disrupts the normal operation of LFC, thus causing excess system frequency/generation excursions. From the perspective of the attacker, LFC system information availability is essential to the attack scheme design. In this paper, two scenarios, where LFC system information is and is not available to the attacker, are considered and optimal attack schemes are studied for these two scenarios, respectively. The optimal attack scheme design is modeled by an optimization problem with different objectives (attack goals): 1) maximization of frequency/generation disruption and 2) least-effort attack (minimization of attack cost). In consideration of counterattack, a threshold-based detection method is used to detect the optimal attack schemes. Two case studies, corresponding to these two scenarios, are simulated, and the results show that attack performances vary with different attack goals and the detection approach can screen out the compromised signals.},

abstract={Intentional interference in satellite navigation is becoming an increasing threat for modern systems relying on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In particular, critical applications such as aviation can be severely affected by un-detected and un-mitigated interference and therefore interference management solutions are crucial to be employed. Methods to cope with such intentional interference enclose interference detection, interference mitigation, interference classification, and interference localization. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of interference management methods developed in the last four decades by the research community. After reviewing the main concepts of GNSS-based navigation, the interference and interference management solutions are classified, with a particular focus on the two major threats in GNSS navigation, namely jamming and spoofing. Mathematical models, comparative tables for various interference management solutions, such as detection, localization, mitigation, and classification, as well as comparative numerical results based on several selected algorithms are also presented. We especially focus on algorithms relying on omni-directional antennas, which do not require additional specific antennas to be installed on the aircraft and thus reduce the costs of retrofit and installation.},

abstract={Memory analysis serves as a foundation for many security applications such as memory forensics, virtual machine introspection and malware investigation. However, malware, or more specifically a kernel rootkit, can often tamper with kernel memory data, putting the trustworthiness of memory analysis under question. With the rapid deployment of cloud computing and increase of cyber attacks, there is a pressing need to systematically study and understand the problem of memory analysis. In particular, without ground truth, the quality of the memory analysis tools widely used for analyzing closed-source operating systems (like Windows) has not been thoroughly studied. Moreover, while it is widely accepted that value manipulation attacks pose a threat to memory analysis, its severity has not been explored and well understood. To answer these questions, we have devised a number of novel analysis techniques including (1) binary level ground-truth collection, and (2) value equivalence set directed field mutation. Our experimental results demonstrate not only that the existing tools are inaccurate even under a non-malicious context, but also that value manipulation attacks are practical and severe. Finally, we show that exploiting information redundancy can be a viable direction to mitigate value manipulation attacks, but checking information equivalence alone is not an ultimate solution.},

abstract={K-anonymity has been used to protect location privacy for location monitoring services in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where sensor nodes work together to report k-anonymized aggregate locations to a server. Each k-anonymized aggregate location is a cloaked area that contains at least k persons. However, we identify an attack model to show that overlapping aggregate locations still pose privacy risks because an adversary can infer some overlapping areas with less than k persons that violates the k-anonymity privacy requirement. In this paper, we propose a reciprocal protocol for location privacy (REAL) in WSNs. In REAL, sensor nodes are required to autonomously organize their sensing areas into a set of non-overlapping and highly accurate k-anonymized aggregate locations. To confront the three key challenges in REAL, namely, self-organization, reciprocity property and high accuracy, we design a state transition process, a locking mechanism and a time delay mechanism, respectively. We compare the performance of REAL with current protocols through simulated experiments. The results show that REAL protects location privacy, provides more accurate query answers, and reduces communication and computational costs.},

However, existing proposals for managing load power demand in such a data center are largely utilization-driven, overlooking power-related interferences among users. An important observation is that some tasks can impact existing power budget management framework and disrupt normal operation by taking away the precious public power capacity. This vulnerability exposes data centers to a new type of risk that we call power grab, which is essentially hostile power resource competition. It could worsen the performance-utilization tradeoff in a power-constrained computing environment. Anticipating a growing case for power-oriented com-petition, we propose CFP, a resilient power capacity management frame-work for improving the fairness and service quality in scale-out data centers. Our solution features a market-based power re-source allocation and billing scheme that involves users in the loop. It allows the data center to bypass the formidable task of identifying malicious users and defend against power grab with reward and punishment incentives. We build a proof-of-concept system and also evaluate our design with realistic Google cluster traces. Compared to prior arts, CFP can increase the average performance-cost ratio by 1.8X. It can boost the total throughput in an APDC by 15% under severe power contention. Our design allows scale-out data centers to safely exploit the benefits that power over-subscription may provide, with minor overhead.},

abstract={Because electricity is the core of our daily lives, no one denies the massive progress we have reached thanks to such a fossil fuel-based technology. But at the same time, these advancements have costly affected our environment. Consequently, recent trends towards restructuring the electrical grids in a way intended to be more monitored, secured and environmental are brought to the forefront of the scientific research. The attempts of reconfiguring the electric power grids were coined as "smart grid". Basically, the internet, ZigBee, wireless mesh networks, WiMax, 3G, 4G, WiFi and Bluetooth are among the common communication technologies to be adopted in the framework of these smart grids alongside many emergent new technologies like the Microgrids, virtual power plants (VPPs), distributed intelligence techniques, smart metering infrastructure and demand response technology as well as distributed and renewable energy resources are conceived to make our electricity more resilient to attacks and natural disasters. As a result, the security side has become one of the major and critical associated issues. Much attention has been devoted to this domain; so, this paper aims at reviewing some of the potential attacks, threats, vulnerabilities as well as some proposed solutions to reinforce the smart grid's efficiency and reliability.},

abstract={SQL injection attacks are a kind of the greatest security risks on Web applications. Much research has been done to detect SQL injection attacks by rule matching and syntax tree. However, due to the complexity and variety of SQL injection vulnerabilities, these approaches fail to detect unknown and variable SQL injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a model, ATTAR, to detect SQL injection attacks using grammar pattern recognition and access behavior mining. The most important idea of our model is to extract and analyze features of SQL injection attacks in Web access logs. To achieve this goal, we first extract and customize Web access log fields from Web applications. Then we design a grammar pattern recognizer and an access behavior miner to obtain the grammatical and behavioral features of SQL injection attacks, respectively. Finally, based on two feature sets, machine learning algorithms, e.g., Naive Bayesian, SVM, ID3, Random Forest, and K-means, are used to train and detect our model. We evaluated our model on these two feature sets, and the results show that the proposed model can effectively detect SQL injection attacks with lower false negative rate and false positive rate. In addition, comparing the accuracy of our model based on different algorithms, ID3 and Random Forest have a better ability to detect various kinds of SQL injection attacks.},

abstract={In the context of Online Social Networks, Spam profiles are not just a source of unwanted ads, but a serious security threat used by online criminals and terrorists for various malicious purposes. Recently, such criminals were able to steal a number of accounts that belong to NatWest bank's customers. Their attack vector was based on spam tweets posted by a Twitter account which looked very close to NatWest customer support account and leaded users to a link of a phishing site. In this study, we investigate the nature of spam profiles in Twitter with a goal to improve social spam detection. Based on a set of publicly available features, we develop spam profiles detection models. At this stage, a dataset of 82 Twitter's profiles are collected and analyzed. With feature engineering, we investigate ten binary and simple features that can be used to classify spam profiles. Moreover, a feature selection process is utilized to identify the most influencing features in the process of detecting spam profiles. For feature selection, two methods are used ReliefF and Information Gain. While for classification, four classification algorithms are applied and compared: Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes. Preliminary experiments in this work show that the promising detection rates can be obtained using such features regardless of the language of the tweets.},

abstract={Social media platforms such as Twitter, Github, and Reddit are widely used forums for discussing all aspects of computer security. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are a frequent recurring topic given their potential for malicious exploitation. We want to understand more about the discussions that are taking place on these platforms and how they may influence a vulnerability's lifespan and “exploitability”. We will do this by analyzing conversations on these platforms that reference a CVE identification number in both content, lifespan, and spread. We found that Twitter is the most common platform for discussion followed by Github. Github discussions indicate the attack vector of a CVE if exploited while Twitter indicates the impact of exploited CVEs. Our findings conclude that by tracking social media outlets, security vendors can identify CVEs with a high probability of malicious exploitation and proactively generate protection.},

abstract={Surveillance cameras, which is a form of Cyber Physical System, are deployed extensively to provide visual surveillance monitoring of activities of interest or anomalies. However, these cameras are at risks of physical security attacks against their physical attributes or configuration like tampering of their recording coverage, camera positions or recording configurations like focus and zoom factors. Such adversarial alteration of physical configuration could also be invoked through cyber security attacks against the camera's software vulnerabilities to administratively change the camera's physical configuration settings. When such Cyber Physical attacks occur, they affect the integrity of the targeted cameras that would in turn render these cameras ineffective in fulfilling the intended security functions. There is a significant measure of research work in detection mechanisms of cyber-attacks against these Cyber Physical devices, however it is understudied area with such mechanisms against integrity attacks on physical configuration. This research proposes the use of the novel use of deep learning algorithms to detect such physical attacks originating from cyber or physical spaces. Additionally, we proposed the novel use of deep learning-based video frame interpolation for such detection that has comparatively better performance to other anomaly detectors in spatiotemporal environments.},

Our TCHs are sensitive to accidental or malicious content modification (tampering) but invariant to the codec used to encode the video. This is necessary due to the curatorial requirement for archives to format shift video over time to ensure future accessibility. Second, we describe how the TCHs (and the models used to derive them) are secured via a proof-of-authority blockchain distributed across multiple independent archives.

abstract={Personalized IoT adapt their behavior based on contextual information, such as user behavior and location. Unfortunately, the fact that personalized IoT adapt to user context opens a side-channel that leaks private information about the user. To that end, we start by studying the extent to which a malicious eavesdropper can monitor the actions taken by an IoT system and extract user's private information. In particular, we show two concrete instantiations (in the context of mobile phones and smart homes) of a new category of spyware which we refer to as Context-Aware Adaptation Based Spyware (SpyCon). Experimental evaluations show that the developed SpyCon can predict users' daily behavior with an accuracy of 90.3%. Being a new spyware with no known prior signature or behavior, traditional spyware detection that is based on code signature or system behavior are not adequate to detect SpyCon. We discuss possible detection and mitigation mechanisms that can hinder the effect of SpyCon.},

abstract={Traditional profiling techniques typically identify performance hot-spots. Other specialized techniques such as WCET analysis cater to safety critical real-time systems with hard constraints and thus make conservative assumptions. However, several domains motivate the need to systematically characterize and represent differential timing properties such as the variance in execution time of application artifacts such as the functions. Such domains include, vulnerability analysis of applications with regard to differential timing attacks, and the optimization of soft-real-time applications to reduce frame-rate fluctuations. In this paper, we motivate the need for execution variance as a performance measure and propose a variance-based analysis scheme. We introduce a new program representation called Variance Characterization Graph (VCG) that is used both as the intermediate representation for the variance-based analysis, and as the final representation that provides concise actionable information to programmers and optimization frameworks. We develop a methodology based on statistical pattern matching to summarize the dominant patterns of application behavior into a very compact VCG representation useful for tuning application behavior such as the soft-real-time properties.},

abstract={Geographic routing offers a radical departure from previous topology-dependent routing paradigms through its use of physical location in the routing process. Geographic routing protocols eliminate dependence on topology storage and the associated costs, which also makes them more suitable to handling dynamic behavior frequently found in wireless ad-hoc networks. Geographic routing protocols have been designed for a variety of applications ranging from mobility prediction and management through to anonymous routing and from energy efficiency to QoS. Geographic routing is also part of the larger area of context-awareness due to its usage of location data to make routing decisions and thus represents an important step in the journey towards ubiquitous computing. The focus of this paper, within the area of geographic routing is on wireless ad-hoc networks and how location information can benefit routing. This paper aims to provide both a comprehensive and methodical survey of existing literature in the area of geographic routing from its inception as well as acting as an introduction to the subject.},

abstract={Deep learning models are vulnerable to various adversarial manipulations of their training data, parameters, and input sample. In particular, an adversary can modify the training data and model parameters to embed backdoors into the model, so the model behaves according to the adversary's objective if the input contains the backdoor features, referred to as the backdoor trigger (e.g., a stamp on an image). The poisoned model's behavior on clean data, however, remains unchanged. Many detection algorithms are designed to detect backdoors on input samples or model parameters, through the statistical difference between the latent representations of adversarial and clean input samples in the poisoned model. In this paper, we design an adversarial backdoor embedding algorithm that can bypass the existing detection algorithms including the state-of-the-art techniques. We design an adaptive adversarial training algorithm that optimizes the original loss function of the model, and also maximizes the indistinguishability of the hidden representations of poisoned data and clean data. This work calls for designing adversary-aware defense mechanisms for backdoor detection.},

Then we use classification algorithms of machine learning to determine whether an app suffers from the code injection attack or not.

Compare with the other method, our approach improves a lot in detection speed with the precision nearly unchanged.

abstract={The rapid usage of the Internet for the last few decades has lead to the deployment of high-speed networks in commercial and educational institutions. As network traffic is increasing, security challenges are also increasing in the high-speed network. Although the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has a significant role in spotting potential attacks, the heavy traffic flow causes severe technical challenges relating to monitoring and detecting the network activities. Moreover, the devastating nature of the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack draws out as a significant cyber-attack regardless of the emergence of Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture. This paper proposes a novel framework to address the performance issues of IDS and the design issues of SDN about DDoS attacks by incorporating intelligence in the data layer using Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) in the SDN architecture. This novel framework is named as DPDK based DDoS Detection (D3) framework, since DPDK provides fast packet processing and monitoring in the data plane. Moreover, the statistical anomaly detection algorithm implemented in the data plane as Virtual Network Function (VNF) using DPDK offers fast detection of DDoS attacks. The experimental results of the D3 framework guarantee both efficiency and effect of the novel IDS framework. The publicly available CIC DoS datasets also ensure the detection effect of a single statistical anomaly detection algorithm against the DDoS attack.},

abstract={Classifying the Leukemia patient is very important in clinical diagnosis and further treatment. Leukemia cancer is classified based on how fast it is spreading and has four different types. A gene is the most vital physical and functional factor of the human body. Genes are formed up of DNA. It differs in size for individuals from a few hundred Chromosome bases to higher than 2 million bases. Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. Most of them are same in human, but a small number of genes about 1 percent of the total are a bit different. The study of Gene feature series of the different patient helps to understand the risk that is associated with the various types of cancer. In this paper, we used the classification algorithm, Naive Bayes, to classify the Leukemia patient from gene feature and predicting if a patient is positive or negative. We used NCBI GEO dataset and normalized the data set using our proposed methodology. Which works based on similarity score to find the fuzzy table. Then using the graph approach and our statistical model we were able to successfully predict the result which matches our actual data set with a high accuracy rate.},

abstract={Hospital biomedical engineering teams are responsible for establishing and regulating medical equipment management programs (MEMPs); these programs ensure the safety and reliability of medical devices. Concomitant with rapid technological advancements, medical devices have been developed that are now being integrated with information and communication technology. However, with the convergence of such diverse technologies, internal and external security threats are continuously increasing. Thus, to reduce medical device security threats, important devices must be identified and prioritized. In this study, we propose a multicriteria decision-making model that prioritizes medical devices by extending the Fennigkoh and Smith model to include security threats. First, we formulate criteria for evaluating medical device functions based on the classification of the medical devices according to their unique functions, connections, and data types. Then, through threat modeling, we develop a method of identifying and evaluating security threats to these devices. We discuss establishing a safer MEMP by analyzing the attack occurrence probability (AOP) and attack success probability (ASP) of medical devices and the inherent security threats that these devices face, none of which are considered in the existing model. Thus, by using the enhanced Fennigkoh and Smith model, our proposed approach enables the development of improved security-enhanced MEMPs, including cybersecurity risk assessments.},

abstract={Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.},

abstract={While NATO nations have long enjoyed relative security from air attack at military installations, recent developments in missile technology and doctrine have threatened that security. With 26 conflicts worldwide in the past 100 years featuring airbase attacks, doctrine and planning tools must be updated to allow continued use of air bases within missile range of enemy forces. Research conducted for the United States Air Force identifies the areas of base resilience and how they affect mission capability. Several models have been developed based on these principles, but there are gaps in model capability and usefulness for allied partners. This paper presents the proposal of a novel base planning model capable of directly quantifying missile attack consequences and generating optimal site layout plans and protection strategies. This model would be implemented using multi-objective genetic algorithms to identify solutions that provide optimal tradeoffs between the competing objectives of minimizing attack consequences, minimizing site construction costs, and minimizing mission impact. These capabilities are expected to assist military engineers in their critical task of analyzing and selecting the design strategy that minimizes operational impacts to a base located in a contested region.},

abstract={Physical (PHY) layer authentication has been a significant trend towards ensuring the identity security of terminals in wireless networks due to the high security and low complexity. However, the independence assumption of existing literature ignores the inherent correlation of the PHY-layer attributes, which limits its generality. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute-based PHY-layer authentication scheme by taking the correlation into account. To cope with the exponential growth of computational complexity in correlated analysis, this paper studies the reconstruction and heuristic algorithm to find a suboptimal authentication solution with low complexity. Specific to the inherent volatility nature of the PHY-layer attributes, we propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) based non-parametric clustering algorithm to enhance the reliability of PHY-layer authentication. Unlike existing PHY-layer authentication schemes based on ML, the proposed PHY-layer authentication scheme does not require any prior information or the training set, which has a more potent universality. Extensive simulations are performed under both synthetic and real data sets, and the figures verify that the proposed authentication scheme can achieve a reliable and robust performance with low complexity.},

Multiple distributed servers simultaneously analyze the feature vector using various detectors and information fusion is used to concatenate the results of detectors.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks play an important role in Internet of Things systems and services but are prone and vulnerable to poor communication channel quality and network attacks. In this paper we are motivated to propose resilient routing algorithms for wireless sensor networks. The main idea is to exploit the link reliability along with other traditional routing metrics for routing algorithm design. We proposed firstly a novel deep-learning based link prediction model, which jointly exploits Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel and Dual Convolutional Neural Network (WL-DCNN) for lightweight subgraph extraction and labelling. It is leveraged to enhance self-learning ability of mining topological features with strong generality. Experimental results demonstrate that WL-DCNN outperforms all the studied 9 baseline schemes over 6 open complex networks datasets. The performance of AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) is improved by 16% on average. Furthermore, we apply the WL-DCNN model in the design of resilient routing for wireless sensor networks, which can adaptively capture topological features to determine the reliability of target links, especially under the situations of routing table suffering from attack with varying degrees of damage to local link community. It is observed that, compared with other classical routing baselines, the proposed routing algorithm with link reliability prediction module can effectively improve the resilience of sensor networks while reserving high-energy-efficiency.},

abstract={Deep learning has an impressive performance of object detection and classification for autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the essential vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples makes the autonomous vehicles suffer severe security and safety issues. Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a change detection algorithm that can run in real time as part of a backend-based stream processing pipeline. It can process the floating car data collected by series-production vehicles to detect changes in an automotive high definition digital (HD) map used for automated driving. The algorithm uses a particle filter approach with odometry, GNSS and landmark readings to localize the vehicle within the digital map. While all particles together represent the probability distribution for the vehicle's position at a given time, each individual particle also serves as a hypothesis about the vehicle's position. This is used to compute various metrics for how well the current sensor readings match the world model encoded in the HD map. The different metrics are evaluated by a number of weak classifiers that are used as input for a trained Adaboost classifier. The achievable detection rate of a single vehicle is then compared to that of a simple crowd-based approach, where each vehicle votes on whether or not the current section of the road has changed.},

abstract={The datacenter introduces new challenges for computer systems around tail latency and security. This paper argues that dynamic NUCA techniques are a better solution to these challenges than prior cache designs. We show that dynamic NUCA designs can meet tail-latency deadlines with much less cache space than prior work, and that they also provide a natural defense against cache attacks. Unfortunately, prior dynamic NUCAs have missed these opportunities because they focus exclusively on reducing data movement.We present Jumanji, a dynamic NUCA technique designed for tail latency and security. We show that prior last-level cache designs are vulnerable to new attacks and offer imperfect performance isolation. Jumanji solves these problems while significantly improving performance of co-running batch applications. Moreover, Jumanji only requires lightweight hardware and a few simple changes to system software, similar to prior D-NUCAs. At 20 cores, Jumanji improves batch weighted speedup by 14% on average, vs. just 2% for a non-NUCA design with weaker security, and is within 2% of an idealized design.},

In other words, the article presents an approach to predicting a potential future risk and suggests the idea of relying on forecasting the likelihood of an attack on information system assets. To establish the risk level at a selected time interval in the future, one has to perform a mathematical decomposition. To do this, we need to select the required information system parameters for the predictions and their statistical data for risk assessment. This method can be used to ensure more detailed budget planning when ensuring the protection of the information system. It can be also applied in case of a change of the information protection configuration to satisfy the accepted level of risk associated with projected threats and vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Mobile Cloud Computing is a combination of Mobile Computing, Cloud Computing and wireless networks to convey rich computational resources to mobile users, network operators, as well as cloud computing providers. Nowadays, the market of mobile devices and its applications are growing at an alarming speed. In general, single application for a specific purpose is not compatible to different operating systems. So the developer has to develop various versions of application which is compatible to different platforms. In order to overcome the drawback of compatibility and interoperability issues, HTML5-based mobile applications are built by using standard web technologies. HTML5-based mobile applications support same version of application in different platforms, but these applications are vulnerable to attacks because of the data and code being fused together. A new form of Code Injection Attack found in this type of mobile applications inherits the property of XSS attack and also uses many channels to inject malicious code such as Contact, SMS, WIFI, NFC, Barcode etc. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code to exhaust all the resources of the victim. Therefore, security is the major issue which impedes the development of Mobile Cloud Computing.

Our goal is to provide a roadmap for researchers seeking to understand existing capabilities and to identify gaps in addressing the numerous threats and vulnerabilities present in VoIP systems.

We identify two specific problem areas (denial of service, and service abuse) as requiring significant more attention from the research community. We also find that the overwhelming majority of the surveyed work takes a black box view of VoIP systems that avoids examining their internal structure and implementation. Such an approach may miss the mark in terms of addressing the main sources of vulnerabilities, i.e., implementation bugs and misconfigurations.

The possibility to include digital signatures with a minimum impact on a standard and a reliable data communication protocol, such as Distributed Network Protocol version 3 (DNP3), also known to have a mature, industrially validated, open-source implementation, has been tested and the results are presented.

abstract={Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a new and largely unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of autonomous DL systems. This article introduces CuRTAIL, a novel end-to-end computing framework to characterize and thwart potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. This, in turn, ensures the effectiveness of the defense in the face of generic attacks. We evaluate the robustness of our proposed methodology against the state-of-the-art adaptive attacks in a white-box setting considering that the adversary knows everything about the victim model and its defenders. Extensive evaluations for analyzing MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet data corroborate the effectiveness of CuRTAIL framework against adversarial samples. The computations in each modular redundancy can be performed independently of the other redundancy modules. As such, CuRTAIL detection algorithm can be completely parallelized among multiple hardware settings to achieve maximum throughput. We further provide an open-source Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate the adoption of the proposed framework for various applications.},

abstract={MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc Networks) are self organized networks with mobile and collaborating nodes without any pre-established infrastructure. Because of these characteristics, securing MANETs constitute a hard and challenging task. Consequently, new mechanisms may be of interest to secure such networks. To this end, we have found that trust management can be a support for MANET security. In fact, the reputation concept and the establishment of trustful relation between collaborating nodes can be meaningful to express security aspects in such environment. From there, we proposed in previous works a Mobility-based Clustering Algorithm (MCA) and a Trust management scheme for MCA (TMCA) to secure routing behaviors. MCA organizes nodes into clusters managed by a cluster-head (CH) and TMCA detects malicious routing behavior based on CHs direct observations and exchanged alerts. A delegation based process was also defined on TMCA and was called DTMCA. Although DTMCA meets security objectives, it may unfortunately be faced with various threats from malicious nodes: Several nodes can in fact collude in order to increase or decrease other reputation values to damage the QoS and even the MANET functioning. Our objective in this paper is then to secure DTMCA against collusion attacks. The mechanism proposed here is based on colluding nodes detection through cluster members behavior monitoring and by comparing this behavior with the received reputation value in the alert message. Detected colluder nodes are then discarded from further communication.},

abstract={Detecting attacks disguised by evasion techniques is a challenge for signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs). This study examines five common evasion techniques to determine their ability to evade recent systems. The denial-of-service (DoS) attack attempts to disable a system by exhausting its resources. Packet splitting tries to chop data into small packets, so that a system may not completely reassemble the packets for signature matching. Duplicate insertion can mislead a system if the system and the target host discard different TCP/IP packets with a duplicate offset or sequence. Payload mutation fools a system with a mutative payload. Shellcode mutation transforms an attacker's shellcode to escape signature detection. This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques on three recent signature-based systems, and among them, explains why Snort can be evaded. The results indicate that duplicate insertion becomes less effective on recent systems, but packet splitting, payload mutation and shellcode mutation can be still effective against them.},

Whilst a seminal contribution at the time of compilation, these datasets no longer represent relevant architecture or contemporary attack protocols, and are beset by data corruptions and inconsistencies. Hence, testing of new IDS approaches against these datasets does not provide an effective performance metric, and contributes to erroneous efficacy claims. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset which is representative of modern attack structure and methodology. The new dataset is contrasted with the legacy datasets, and the performance difference of commonly used intrusion detection algorithms is highlighted.},

abstract={Televisions have become "smart" with the addition of computers into their designs. Smart TVs represent a recent risk to the digital cybersecurity ecosystem. Higher-end smart TV models generally sell for more than $1000. Some smart TV's sell for more than $10000. Research has shown that these relatively expensive devices have little to no effective protection against malware leaving them at risk of total loss. This situation creates the need for an apparatus that could conceivably provide a reasonable level of protection from malware at a marginal cost relative to the cost of a high-end Smart TV. This paper presents several concepts for such an apparatus and postulates a recommended approach to secure users against malware attacks on Smart TVs.},

abstract={The recent bloom of Internet of Things (IoT) and its prevalence in many security-sensitive environments made the security of these networks a crucial requirement. Routing in many of IoT networks has been performed using the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL), due to its energy-efficient mechanisms, secure modes availability, and its adaptivity to work in various environments; hence, RPL security has been the focus of many researchers. This paper presents a comprehensive study of RPL, its known attacks, and the mitigation methods proposed to counter these attacks. We conducted a detailed review of the RPL standard, including a recently proposed modification. Also, we investigated all recently published attacks on RPL and their mitigation methods through the literature. Based on this investigation, and to the best of our knowledge, we introduced a first-of-its-kind classification scheme for the mitigation methods that is based on the techniques used for the mitigation. Furthermore, we thoroughly discussed RPL-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and their classifications, highlighting the most recently proposed IDSs.},

abstract={Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to provide a principled framework for optimally balancing exploitation and exploration. Then, a POMDP solver can be used to solve the problem. If the prior distribution over the environment's dynamics is a product of Dirichlet distributions, the POMDP's optimal value function can be represented using a set of multivariate polynomials. Unfortunately, the size of the polynomials grows exponentially with the problem horizon. In this paper, we examine the use of an online Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for large POMDPs, to solve the Bayesian reinforcement learning problem online. We will show that such an algorithm successfully searches for a near-optimal policy. In addition, we examine the use of a parameter tying method to keep the model search space small, and propose the use of nested mixture of tied models to increase robustness of the method when our prior information does not allow us to specify the structure of tied models exactly. Experiments show that the proposed methods substantially improve scalability of current Bayesian reinforcement learning methods.},

abstract={The unprecedented success of deep neural networks in many applications has made these networks a prime target for adversarial exploitation. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark technique for detecting backdoor attacks (aka Trojan attacks) on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the concept of Universal Litmus Patterns (ULPs), which enable one to reveal backdoor attacks by feeding these universal patterns to the network and analyzing the output (i.e., classifying the network as `clean' or `corrupted'). This detection is fast because it requires only a few forward passes through a CNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ULPs for detecting backdoor attacks on thousands of networks with different architectures trained on four benchmark datasets, namely the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), MNIST, CIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The codes and train/test models for this paper can be found here: https://umbcvision.github.io/Universal-Litmus-Patterns/.},

A support vector machine is used to create a reference model, which is used to evaluate two methods of feature reduction, which are “area of intersect” and “subspace analysis using eigenvectors.” The findings show that the relationships between features are complex and simple statistics filtering approaches do not provide a viable approach.

In this paper, we propose a DNS query-based DDoS attack mitigation system using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to block the network traffic for DDoS attacks. With some features provided by SDN, we can analyze traffic patterns and filter suspicious network flows out. To show the feasibility of the proposed system, we particularly implemented a prototype with Dirichlet process mixture model to distinguish benign traffic from malicious traffic and conducted experiments with the dataset collected from real network traces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by both simulations and experiment data obtained from the real network traffic traces.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMCT) task in a city-scale multi-camera network. As the trajectory of each target is naturally split into multiple sub-trajectories (namely local tracklets) in different cameras, the key issue of MTMCT is how to match local tracklets belonging to the same target across different cameras. To this end, we propose an efficient two-step MTMCT approach to robustly track vehicles in a camera network. It first generates all local tracklets and then matches the ones belonging to the same target across different cameras. More specifically, in the local tracklet generation phase, we follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm and link the detections to local tracklets by graph clustering. In the cross-camera tracklet matching phase, we first develop a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to produce robust tracklet representations. We then prune false matching candidates by traffic topology reasoning and match tracklets across cameras using the recently proposed TRACklet-to-Target Assignment (TRACTA) algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on the City-Scale Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking task at the 2020 AI City Challenge and achieves the second-best results.},

abstract={Machine learning has been broadly applied in different applications due to its satisfying performance. In security-related applications, e.g. facial recognition and fingerprint identification, an adversary misleads the pattern recognition system on purpose by manipulating training or test samples. Black-box attack is one of adversarial attacks which camouflages unseen samples to evade the detection with limited information on the system. Recently, there are a few studies on the robustness of machine learning, especially deep learning, under black-box attack. In this study, we investigate the security of the stacked autoencoder, which is one of the most famous models in deep learning against black-box attack. A training dataset generation method is proposed for a substitute model in black-box attack. By enquiring labels of samples from the target classifier, we train a model to approximate the target classifier. To have a better approximation to the decision boundary of the target classifier, a hybrid data generation method is adopted to increase the number of the training data. We generate new samples by combining both near and far away the decision boundary of the substitute model. The experiment results suggest that our proposed method downgrades the classifier in terms of accuracy more significantly than the existing one within less label query times. It shows the proposed method is more efficient to train a substitute model to approximate target classifier.},

abstract={Scene text detection (STD) aims to locate text in images and plays an important role in many computer vision tasks including automatic driving and text recognition systems. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely and successfully used in scene text detection, leading to plenty of DNN-based STD methods including regression-based and segmentation-based STD methods. However, recent studies have also shown that DNN is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly degrade the performance of DNN models. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of DNN-based STD methods against adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose a generic and efficient attack method to generate adversarial examples, which are produced by adding small but imperceptible adversarial perturbation to the input images. Experiments on attacking four various models and a real-world STD engine of Google optical character recognition (OCR) show that the state-of-the-art DNN-based STD methods including regression-based and segmentation-based methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.},

abstract={As a fundamental component of the Internet, Domain Name System (DNS) is widely abused by attackers in various cybercrimes, making malicious domain detection an essential task in network defenses. However, some well-crafted attacks with tricky techniques can not only bypass blacklists but also make some machine learning-based detection systems infeasible. In this paper, we design HGDom, an accurate and robust malicious domain detection system based on a heterogeneous graph convolutional network method. First, we jointly analyze domain features as well as the complex relations among domains, clients, and IP addresses. To capture richer information, we introduce a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) to model the DNS scene. Then, we propose a novel representation method named MAGCN. With a meta-path-based attention mechanism, it can handle node features and the graph structure in HIN at the same time. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to apply GCN in cyber security analysis. Comprehensive experiments over DNS data from TUNET and CERNET2 are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed methods. The comparison results show that HGDom outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with promising performance. Besides, the system is decided to be deployed in production to assist with network security management for CERNET2.},

APTs are stealthy attacks with the primary objective of gaining unauthorized access to network assets. They often remain dormant for an extended period of time, which makes their detection challenging. In this paper, we leverage machine learning (ML) to detect hosts in a network that are targeted by an APT attack. We evaluate a number of ML classifiers to detect susceptible hosts in the Los Alamos National Lab dataset. We explore (i) graph-based features extracted from multiple data sources i.e., network flows and host authentication logs, (ii) feature engineering to reduce dimensionality, and (iii) balancing the training dataset using numerous over- and under-sampling techniques. Finally, we compare our model to the state-of-the-art approaches that leverage the same dataset, and show that our model outperforms them with respect to prediction performance and overhead.},

A driver-identification technology is an effective method to perform vehicle-theft detection. It can also provide customized driver-personalization services, such as healthcare or insurance. In this article, we propose and evaluate a driver-identification method based on wavelet transform by performing driving-pattern analysis for each driver. We compare the performances of three different machine-learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost for performing driver identification. The proposed method is applicable to both binary and multiclass classifications for the driving data of five drivers. In the case of motorway, the XGBoost classifier identifies each driver and delivers an accuracy of up to 96.18% in binary classification and an accuracy of 91.6% in multiclass classification. Moreover, in the case of an urban road, the SVM classifier achieves an accuracy of up to 95.07% in binary classification and accuracy of 89.06% in multiclass classification. The proposed method provides a context for a better understanding of the association between driver behavior, which is an in-vehicle event, and mechanical reactions. Our results shall help researchers to broaden the understanding of driver identification using in-vehicle data.},

abstract={Vital organizations have faced increasing challenges of how to defend against insider threats that may cause a severe damage to their assets. The nature of insider threats is more challenging than external threats, as insiders have a privileged access to sensitive assets of an organization. In fact, there are several studies that reviewed the insider threat detection approaches from taxonomical and theoretical perspectives. However, the protection against insider threat incidents requires empirical defense solutions. Hence, our study uniquely focuses on empirical detection approaches that are validated with empirical results. We propose a 10-question model that highlights different prospective of empirical detection approaches. Significant factors are also proposed to reveal the extent to which the detection approaches are effective against insider threat incidents (e.g., feature domains, protection coverage, classification techniques, simulated scenarios, performance and accuracy metrics, etc.). The objective of this paper is to enhance researchers' efforts in the domain of insider attack by systemizing the detection techniques in comparable manner. It also highlights the challenges and gaps for further research to institute more effective solutions that can predict, detect, and prevent emerging attack incidents. Some recommendations for future research directions are also presented.},

Second, we show that OneSwarm is much more vulnerable to a collusion attack than previously reported, and we quantify the attack’s success given a file’s popularity, a factor not evaluated earlier. Third, we present a novel application of a known TCP-based attack. It allows a single attacker to identify whether a neighbor is the source of data or a proxy for it. Each of these attacks can be repeated as attackers quit and rejoin the network. We present these attacks in the context of forensics and the investigation of child pornography.

PhishBench is a first in the field of benchmarking phishing related research and incorporates thorough and systematic evaluation and feature comparison. We use PhishBench to test methods published in the phishing literature on new and diverse datasets to check their robustness and scalability. We study how dataset characteristics, e.g., varying legitimate to phishing ratios and increasing the size of imbalanced datasets, affect classification performance. Our results show that the imbalanced nature of phishing attacks affects the detection systems' performance and researchers should take this into account when proposing a new method. We also found that retraining alone is not enough to defeat new attacks. New features and techniques are required to stop attackers from fooling detection systems.},

abstract={In this paper we attempt to provide unified security and privacy multilateral security architecture for cloud services stack, using key latest technology via LxC in general and Docker containers in specific. Docker is one of the first to use LxC at such a large scale, but LxC is not a very new concept, it is around for quite some time. Docker container service is a key Platform as a Service (PaaS) based engine. Unified layered cloud computing multilateral security implementation addresses the potential risks associated with cloud computing environment. It also specifies when, at what time, where, and how to apply security controls. Unified Design includes the structured connection between the components of cloud ecosystem for basket and bucket of unified cloud-based hybrid services using micro service oriented venture architectural services realized in terms of PAAS using Docker container as a service. We surveyed various industry/academic professionals and based on our experience we tried to understand the challenges they faced while using the cloud system. We tried to understand the security challenges, incidents, story pieces, accidents, experience they faced while designing, implementing and using the cloud services/resources virtually via online. This work helps to assess the security design and architecture quality using multilateral security framework for Docker container. We try to present the architecture using OSI/TCP/IP stack model with reference to Cloud service stack model and deployment stack model and try to propose the balanced multilateral security prototype with reference to Docker Container security architecture.},

abstract={A novel real-time algorithm for head and hand tracking is proposed in this paper. This approach is based on data from a range camera, which is exploited to resolve ambiguities and overlaps. The position of the head is estimated with a depth-based template matching, its robustness being reinforced with an adaptive search zone. Hands are detected in a bounding box attached to the head estimate, so that the user may move freely in the scene. A simple method to decide whether the hands are open or closed is also included in the proposal. Experimental results show high robustness against partial occlusions and fast movements. Accurate hand trajectories may be extracted from the estimated hand positions, and may be used for interactive applications as well as for gesture classification purposes.},

abstract={Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) provide a device-unique challenge-response mapping and are employed for authentication and encryption purposes. Unpredictability and reliability are the core requirements of PUFs: unpredictability implies that an adversary cannot sufficiently predict future responses from previous observations. Reliability is important as it increases the reproducibility of PUF responses and hence allows validation of expected responses. However, advanced machine-learning algorithms have been shown to be a significant threat to the practical validity of PUFs, as they are able to accurately model PUF behavior. The most effective technique was shown to be the XOR-based combination of multiple PUFs, but as this approach drastically reduces reliability, it does not scale well against software-based machine-learning attacks. In this paper, we analyze threats to PUF security and propose PolyPUF, a scalable and secure architecture to introduce polymorphic PUF behavior. This architecture significantly increases model-building resistivity while maintaining reliability. An extensive experimental evaluation and comparison demonstrate that the PolyPUF architecture can secure various PUF configurations and is the only evaluated approach to withstand highly complex neural network machine-learning attacks. Furthermore, we show that PolyPUF consumes less energy and has less implementation overhead in comparison to lightweight reference architectures.},

abstract={Android OS-based mobile devices have attracted numerous end-users since they are convenient to work with and offer a variety of features.

Every year, researchers propose a novel Android malware analyzer framework to defend against real-world Android malware Apps. The researchers require an inclusive Android dataset to assess their Android analyzers. However, generating a comprehensive Android malware dataset is a challenging concept in malware scrutiny fields. In 2018, we made the first part of our Android malware dataset, CICAndMal2017 [16], publicly available while performing dynamic analyses on real smartphones. In this paper, we provide the second part of the CICAndMal2017 dataset [16] publicly available which includes permissions and intents as static features, and API calls as dynamic features. Besides, we examine these features with our two-layer Android malware analyzer. According to our analyses, we succeeded in achieving 95.3% precision in Static-Based Malware Binary Classification at the first layer, 83.3% precision in Dynamic-Based Malware Category Classification and 59.7% precision in Dynamic-Based Malware Family Classification at the second layer.},

abstract={Recent trends have shown that botnets have been active since the 1990s. Attackers use newer technologies to damage enterprises and individuals through identity theft, bank fraud, spam campaigns, malware distribution, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. To identify the hidden details from a DDoS attack, we introduce a forensic model in this paper. This model uses NS2 to simulate the connectivity of real nodes in the network and uses Botnet and DDoS attack electronic evidence analysis methods. The botnet uses IRC channels as the basic unit. The analytical algorithm for Botnet uses election vectors to detect the split and transfer behavior of hackers. The analysis method for DDoS attacks uses attack vectors to detect whether Botnet is participating in a DDoS attack. On this basis, the fragmented packet marking method is added to track the source and path reconstruction of the router, thereby improving the scale recognition rate to 93%.},

In this work, we investigate a multi-source localization framework in which monaural source segregation is used as a mechanism to increase the robustness of azimuth estimates from a binaural input. We demonstrate performance improvement relative to binaural only methods assuming a known number of spatially stationary sources. We also propose a flexible azimuth-dependent model of binaural features that independently captures characteristics of the binaural setup and environmental conditions, allowing for adaptation to new environments or calibration to an unseen binaural setup. Results with both simulated and recorded impulse responses show that robust performance can be achieved with limited prior training.},

Market research company Gartner estimates that around 4.9 billion connected things will be in use in 2015, and around 25 billion by 2020. While there are substantial opportunities accompanying IoT, spanning from Healthcare to Energy, there are an equal number of concerns regarding the security and privacy of this plethora of ubiquitous devices. In this position paper we approach security and privacy in IoT from a different perspective to existing research, by considering the impact that IoT may have on the growing problem of insider threat within enterprises. Our specific aim is to explore the extent to which IoT may exacerbate the insider-threat challenge for organisations and overview the range of new and adapted attack vectors. Here, we focus especially on (personal) devices which insiders bring and use within their employer's enterprise. As a start to addressing these issues, we outline a broad research agenda to encourage further research in this area.},

abstract={As distributed generators (DGs) rapidly integrate into current power systems, new methods to effectively manage them need to be developed. Toward this end, a large number of geographically dispersed DGs are generally aggregated into a virtual power plant (VPP). Then, distributed control schemes are used to achieve optimal economic dispatch of the VPP by maintaining equal incremental costs of DGs while the aggregated DG power matches the dispatch command. Often, one of the drawbacks of distributed schemes is that they are susceptible to communication failures and cyber-attacks (i.e., noncolluding and colluding attacks). In order to mitigate this problem, an attack-robust distributed economic dispatch strategy is proposed where we assume that every DG can monitor the behavior of its in-neighbors and has the network connectivity information. The proposed strategy detects the misbehaving DGs residing in the network and gradually isolates them so that the remaining well-behaving DGs could still accomplish the economic dispatch. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated through simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test system.},

abstract={Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attacks are one of the biggest concerns for security professionals. DDoS flooding attacks are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services. Attackers usually gain access to a large number of computers by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack armies (i.e., Botnets). Once an attack army has been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale attack against one or more targets. Developing a comprehensive defense mechanism against identified and anticipated DDoS flooding attacks is a desired goal of the intrusion detection and prevention research community. However, the development of such a mechanism requires a comprehensive understanding of the problem and the techniques that have been used thus far in preventing, detecting, and responding to various DDoS flooding attacks. In this paper, we explore the scope of the DDoS flooding attack problem and attempts to combat it. We categorize the DDoS flooding attacks and classify existing countermeasures based on where and when they prevent, detect, and respond to the DDoS flooding attacks. Moreover, we highlight the need for a comprehensive distributed and collaborative defense approach. Our primary intention for this work is to stimulate the research community into developing creative, effective, efficient, and comprehensive prevention, detection, and response mechanisms that address the DDoS flooding problem before, during and after an actual attack.},

abstract={The remarkable success of machine learning (ML) in a variety of research domains has inspired academic and industrial communities to explore its potential to address hardware Trojan (HT) attacks. While numerous works have been published over the past decade, few survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, have systematically reviewed the achievements and analyzed the remaining challenges in this area. To fill this gap, this article surveys ML-based approaches against HT attacks available in the literature. In particular, we first provide a classification of all possible HT attacks and then review recent developments from four perspectives, i.e., HT detection, design-for-security (DFS), bus security, and secure architecture. Based on the review, we further discuss the lessons learned in and challenges arising from previous studies. Despite current work focusing more on chip-layer HT problems, it is notable that novel HT threats are constantly emerging and have evolved beyond chips and to the component, device, and even behavior layers, therein compromising the security and trustworthiness of the overall hardware ecosystem. Therefore, we divide the HT threats into four layers and propose a hardware Trojan defense (HTD) reference model from the perspective of the overall hardware ecosystem, therein categorizing the security threats and requirements in each layer to provide a guideline for future research in this direction.},

abstract={Deep neural networks are susceptible to various inference attacks as they remember information about their training data. We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge. We evaluate our novel white-box membership inference attacks against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is the algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset. We also show how adversarial participants, in the federated learning setting, can successfully run active membership inference attacks against other participants, even when the global model achieves high prediction accuracies.},

abstract={This paper presents a systematic methodology to identify and validate security attacks that exploit user influenceable hardware faults (i.e., rowhammer errors). We break down rowhammer attack procedures into nine generalized steps where some steps are designed to increase the attack success probabilities. Our framework can perform those nine operations (e.g., pressuring system memory and spraying landing pages) as well as inject rowhammer errors which are basically modeled as ≥3-bit errors. When one of the injected errors is activated, such can cause control or data flow divergences which can then be caught by a prepared landing page and thus lead to a successful attack. Our experiments conducted against a guest operating system of a typical cloud hypervisor identified multiple reproducible targets for privilege escalation, shell injection, memory and disk corruption, and advanced denial-of-service attacks. Because the presented rowhammer attack injection (RAI) methodology uses error injection and thus statistical sampling, RAI can quantitatively evaluate the modeled rowhammer attack success probabilities of any given target software states.},

volume={18},

pages={1805-1818},
abstract={Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) promote innovations in the industry such as structural status mapping, instrument fault diagnosing, and oriented automation system associating. However, due to the shared nature of the wireless propagation environment, the emerging sensor nodes (SNs) with wireless properties are vulnerable to external malicious attacks. The security threats, especially Sybil attacks, impose great difficulties in fulfilling quality requirements of industrial applications. What is more complicated is that the harsh industrial environment brings about new challenges which can degrade the accuracy of detecting Sybil threats. In this paper, we focus on how to detect the malicious packets transmitted from Sybil attackers without adding extra authentication overhead into the transmission frame. We develop a multi-Kernel-based expectation maximization (MKEM) scheme to detect Sybil attacks in IWSNs. Instead of directly investigating the radio resource of SNs, we produce channel-vectors which are extracted from the power gain and delay spread of the channel impulse response obtained from the received packets to represent each SN. Specifically, a kernel-oriented method is designed to discriminate the malicious packets from benign ones without establishing a pre-defined database of channel features of all SNs. Meanwhile, we allocate different kernel weights to the proposed kernels and combine them to improve the discrimination ability of the scheme. Moreover, a kernel parameter optimization method is developed to regulate each kernel weight and parameter to reduce the effects of transmission impairments in IWSNs. To avoid poor detection accuracy when the number of Sybil attackers increases, we use the gap statistical analysis method to verify and EM method to summarize the detection results. The simulation results show that the proposed MKEM scheme can achieve high accuracy on detecting malicious packets transmitted from Sybil attackers from benign ones, and tolerate the effects of transmission impairments in the industrial environment. Moreover, the MKEM scheme can guarantee the detection accuracy even if the number of Sybil attackers increases.},

abstract={The analysis of the network traffic in 5G networks is of high significance to the network security administrator, since it could allow for the identification of different behavioural groups and the distinction of anomalous from normal activity. The problem is the multi-dimensional nature of the data, e.g. SMS, call, Internet, services etc. that makes it difficult to analyse. This is even more challenging in 5G networks, compared to previous generation networks, since one more dimension is added to the traffic, representing different network slices. In this respect, activity that is normal in one slice can be anomalous in another. This paper presents a graph-based method for network mining and visualization of user activities in a mobile network. The raw multi- dimensional network traffic data are used for the construction of multiple multi-dimensional graph- based features that capture specific behavioural aspects for each user. Within each feature, graph matching techniques are applied in order to identify groups of users with similar behaviour. The dissimilarity results for each feature are combined using a multi-objective visualization method. The outcome is a data visualization in which users with similar behaviour are depicted as points close to each other. The network analyst is able to select the desired trade-off among the multiple features, and visually detect groups of users with similar behaviours, as well as possible anomalous clusters or outliers. Experimental evaluation of the proposed approach in several application scenarios verify its efficiency.},

abstract={A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a wireless network of wearable computing devices and intelligent physiological sensors. The intelligent physiological sensors collect and process sensitive data from the patient body. The security, reliability, and trustworthiness of sensitive data collected and processed by intelligent physiological sensors are critical due to its unique application domain. Moreover, consistent and reliable data gathering along with its transmission also plays a vital role in WBANs. Trust management (in BANs) has been found as a useful tool to improve cooperation among sensor nodes, security as well as reliability. The paper recommends a novel and efficient, lightweight trust assessment scheme (ETAS) suitable for health application domains and does not rely purely on any encryption technique. The primary purpose is to develop an exciting comprehensive, novel trust estimation framework for BANs to enhance reliability, dependability, security by isolating compromised (hotspot) nodes with great resource efficiency. ETAS incorporates several exclusive (unique) features like efficient trust evaluator, secure and attack resistant, along with competent trust aggregator function to achieve comprehensive trust score. The trust evaluator function is a multi-trust (communication trust, data trust, and energy trust) strategy to deal with severe internal security threats such as badmouthing attack, ballot-stuffing attack, sybil attack, traitor attack, etc. with less resource consumption. Moreover, ETAS incorporates both the success rate and misbehavior component during trust evaluation. The success rate record the number of successful/unsuccessful interactions among sensor nodes in terms of packet send/receive. The misbehavior component keeps records of current and past misbehavior of sensor nodes for effective decision making. Moreover, ETAS focus on the frequency of interaction among biomedical sensor nodes within a specified period to analyze their behavior for efficient trust decisions. Furthermore, ETAS incorporates temperature, data trust as well as the trust score of biomedical sensors to identify hotspot nodes in BSN. ETAS offers full flexibility to adjust the trust threshold, trust domain, reward, and punishment term according to system and application requirements. ETAS’s efficiency is validated through several outcomes (MATLAB R2019a) along with theoretical analysis in terms of energy consumption, attack detection, mitigation, trust computation cost, and packet delivery ratio.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made remarkable achievements in several areas, such as image classification. However, extensive researches show that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are generated by adding some small perturbations on original images. DeepFool is an effective algorithm for generating adversarial examples with higher success rate and smaller perturbations. However, DeepFool computes the distance of all classification boundaries of the dataset, which causes the speed of DeepFool to be very slow. To address this problem, this paper proposes DADF, a dynamic adaptive method for generating adversarial examples. Based on tracing the information of the attacking process, DADF dynamically selects the subset of target labels. The subset of target labels is dynamically updated once successful adversarial examples are generated. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets show that, comparing with DeepFool, DADF reduce the time greatly while generating 10000 adversarial examples on the MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset.},

abstract={Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS Attack) is one of the types of attacks that use multiple hosts as attacker against a system. There is a difference between Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS Attack) and Denial-of-Service (DoS Attack). DDoS attacks are distributed, meaning spread using multiple hosts, while the DoS attack is one-on-one. DoS attacks requires a powerful host, either from the resource or operating system used to carry out the attack. In this study, we discuss how to handle DDoS attacks in the form of detection method based on the pattern of flow entries and handling mechanism using layered firewall. Tests carried out using three scenario that is simulations on normal network environment, unsecured network, and secure network. Then, we analyze the simulations result that has been done.

abstract={Nowadays, most of the world's population has become much dependent on computers for banking, healthcare, shopping, and telecommunication. Security has now become a basic norm for computers and its resources since it has become inherently insecure. Security issues like Denial of Service attacks, TCP SYN Flooding attacks, Packet Dropping attacks and Distributed Denial of Service attacks are some of the methods by which unauthorized users make the resource unavailable to authorized users. There are several security mechanisms like Intrusion Detection System, Anomaly detection and Trust model by which we can be able to identify and counter the abuse of computer resources by unauthorized users. This paper presents a survey of several security mechanisms which have been implemented using Fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is one of the rapidly developing technologies, which is used in a sophisticated control system. Fuzzy logic deals with the degree of truth rather than the Boolean logic, which carries the values of either true or false. So instead of providing only two values, we will be able to define intermediate values.},

abstract={Adversarial examples are inputs designed by an adversary with the goal of fooling the machine learning models. Most of the research about adversarial examples have focused on perturbing the natural inputs with the assumption that the true label remains unchanged. Even in this limited setting and despite extensive studies in recent years, there is no defence against adversarial examples for complex tasks (e.g., ImageNet). However, for simpler tasks like handwritten digit classification, a robust model seems to be within reach. Unlike perturbation-based adversarial examples, the adversary is not limited to small norm-based perturbations in unrestricted adversarial examples. Hence, defending against unrestricted adversarial examples is a more challenging task. In this paper, we show that previous methods for generating unrestricted adversarial examples ignored a large part of the adversarial subspace. In particular, we demonstrate the bias of previous methods towards generating samples that are far inside the decision boundaries of an auxiliary classifier. We also show the similarity of the decision boundaries of an auxiliary classifier and baseline CNNs. By putting these two evidence together, we explain why adversarial examples generated by the previous approaches lack the desired transferability. Additionally, we present an efficient technique to create adversarial examples using generative adversarial networks to address this issue. We demonstrate that even the state-of-the-art MNIST classifiers are vulnerable to the adversarial examples generated with this technique. Additionally, we show that examples generated with our method are transferable. Accordingly, we hope that new proposed defences use this attack to evaluate the robustness of their models against unrestricted attacks.},

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. The Verification of handwritten Signature, which is a behavioral biometric, can be classified into off-line and online signature verification methods. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: online Signature Verification This paper addresses using ensemble approach of Radial Basis Function Classifier for online Signature Verification. Online signature verification, in general, gives a higher verification rate than off-line verification methods, because of its use of both static and dynamic features of problem space in contrast to off-line which uses only the static features. We show that proposed ensemble of Radial Basis Function classifier is superior to individual approach for Signature Verification in terms of classification rate.},

abstract={In order to avoid detection, malware can disguise itself as a legitimate program or hijack system processes to reach its goals. Commonly used signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) struggle to distinguish between these processes and are thus only of limited use to detect such attacks. They also have the shortcoming that they need to be updated frequently to possess the latest malware definitions. This makes them inherently prone to missing novel attack techniques. Misuse detection IDSs however overcome this problem by maintaining a ground truth of normal application behavior while reporting deviations as anomalies. In our approach, we try to accomplish this by observing a process' memory consumption. This is for two reasons: We expect the readings to be less volatile in comparison to for instance network operations. Second, by breaking the problem down, we are able to investigate thoroughly while still laying the foundations for future expansion. We use the observations from a given host to train a machine learning algorithm. After an initial learning phase, we evaluate the model with readings from the application it has been trained on and other applications in order to assess its quality. Our results indicate that the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on parametrizing the machine learning algorithm appropriately. A large variance in accuracy with only slightly altered inputs confirms this suggestion. We finish with a discussion on deploying such an IDS at scale in a realistic scenario.},

abstract={In today's IoT smart environments, dozens of MCU-based connected device types exist such as HVAC controllers, smart meters, smoke detectors, etc. The security conditions for these essential IoT devices remain unsatisfactory since: (i) many of them are built with cost as the driving design tenet, resulting in poor configurations and open design; (ii) their memory and computational resource constraints make it highly challenging to implement practical attack protection mechanisms; and (iii) currently, manufacturers use simplified light protocol versions to save memory for extra features (to boost sales). When such issues and vulnerabilities are exploited, devices can be compromised and converted into bots whereby severe DDoS attacks can be launched by a botmaster. Such tiny devices are safe only when connected to networks with defense mechanisms installed in their networking devices like routers and switches, which might not be present everywhere, e.g. on public/free Wi-Fi networks. To safeguard tiny IoT devices from cyberattacks, we provide resource-friendly standalone attack detection models termed Edge2Guard (E2G) that enable MCU-based IoT devices to instantly detect IoT attacks without depending on networks or any external protection mechanisms. During evaluation, our top-performing E2G models detected and classified ten types of Mirai and Bashlite malware with close to 100% detection rates.},

Therefore, the evaluation of Microblog user credibility has become an important research issue. This paper proposes a microblog user credibility evaluation algorithm based on trust propagation. In view of the high consumption and low precision caused by malicious users' attacking algorithms and manual selection of seed sets by establishing false social relationships, this paper proposes two optimization strategies: pruning algorithm based on social activity and similarity and based on The seed node selection algorithm of clustering. The pruning algorithm can trim off the attack edges established by malicious users and normal users. The seed node selection algorithm can efficiently select the highly available seed node set, and finally use the user social relationship graph to perform the two-way propagation trust scoring, so that the low trusted user has a lower trusted score and thus identifies the malicious user. The related experiments verify the effectiveness of the trustworthiness-based user credibility evaluation algorithm in the evaluation of Microblog user credibility.},

abstract={The popularity of online social networks (OSNs) has resulted in them being targeted with Sybil attacks, where an adversary forges many fake identities (called Sybils) to disrupt or control the normal functioning of the system. Several schemes have been proposed to defend against Sybil attacks. Most of these schemes work by computing the landing probability or statistical distribution of visiting frequency of random walks. These schemes usually have high running time cost and are highly dependent upon the proper choice of known trusted nodes. To address these limitations, in this paper we present SybilExposer, an efficient and effective Sybil community detection algorithm, which relies on the properties of social graph communities to rank communities according to their perceived likelihood of being fake or Sybil. Our experiments on several real-world OSN graphs illustrate that SybilExposer has close to 100% true positive rate and nearly zero false positive rate in identifying Sybil communities, and the best running time complexity compared to the state of the art.},

abstract={Speaker identification models are vulnerable to carefully designed adversarial perturbations of their input signals that induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a white-box steganography-inspired adversarial attack that generates imperceptible adversarial perturbations against a speaker identification model. Our approach, FoolHD, uses a Gated Convolutional Autoencoder that operates in the DCT domain and is trained with a multi-objective loss function, to generate and conceal the adversarial perturbation within the original audio files. In addition to hindering speaker identification performance, this multi-objective loss accounts for human perception through a frame-wise cosine similarity between MFCC feature vectors extracted from the original and adversarial audio files. We validate the effectiveness of FoolHD with a 250-speaker identification x-vector network, trained using VoxCeleb, in terms of accuracy, success rate, and imperceptibility. Our results show that FoolHD generates highly imperceptible adversarial audio files (average PESQ scores above 4.30), while achieving a success rate of 99.6% and 99.2% in misleading the speaker identification model, for untargeted and targeted settings, respectively.},

abstract={Recently, a special type of data poisoning (DP) attack against deep neural network (DNN) classifiers, known as a backdoor, was proposed. These attacks do not seek to degrade classification accuracy, but rather to have the classifier learn to classify to a target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in a test example. Here, we address the challenging post-training detection of backdoor attacks in DNN image classifiers, wherein the defender does not have access to the poisoned training set, but only to the trained classifier itself, as well as to clean (unpoisoned) examples from the classification domain. We propose a defense against imperceptible backdoor attacks based on perturbation optimization and novel, robust detection inference. Our method detects whether the trained DNN has been backdoor-attacked and infers the source and target classes involved in an attack. It outperforms alternative defenses for several backdoor patterns, data sets, and attack settings.},

A special case is port 0 which is reserved but was never assigned. Traffic from and to port 0 is unusual, because it should not occur in the wild. As port 0 is unassigned, there is no common service listing for connections here. Furthermore, operating systems usually interpret the request to open port 0 as the request to allocate and open any currently unused port. Thus, traffic from and to port 0 should not occur, because no application should listen there and applications cannot send from port 0. In practice, we do however see traffic from and to port 0, which indicates that someone makes the effort to bypass the normal operating system network stack to create these unusual packets. As a corner case of network protocols, the aspect of port 0 has basically never been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we analyze network traffic collected through a /15 network telescope over a period of 3 years to characterize these curious data flows. We find that port 0 traffic seems to be used in the wild by a select few for a variety of purposes, from DDoS attacks to system fingerprinting, and that some of these actors possess a surprisingly sophisticated knowledge of OS behavior.},

abstract={During the past years, malicious PDF files have become a serious threat for the security of modern computer systems. They are characterized by a complex structure and their variety is considerably high. Several solutions have been academically developed to mitigate such attacks. However, they leveraged on information that were extracted from either only the structure or the content of the PDF file. This creates problems when trying to detect non-Javascript or targeted attacks. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning system for the automatic detection of malicious PDF documents. It extracts information from both the structure and the content of the PDF file, and it features an advanced parsing mechanism. In this way, it is possible to detect a wide variety of attacks, including non-Javascript and parsing-based ones. Moreover, with a careful choice of the learning algorithm, our approach provides a significantly higher accuracy compared to other static analysis techniques, especially in the presence of adversarial malware manipulation.},

abstract={Scalability of object detectors with respect to the number of classes is a very important issue for applications where many object classes need to be detected. While combining single-class detectors yields a linear complexity for testing, multi-class detectors that localize all objects at once come often at the cost of a reduced detection accuracy. In this work, we present a scalable multi-class detection algorithm which scales sublinearly with the number of classes without compromising accuracy. To this end, a shared discriminative codebook of feature appearances is jointly trained for all classes and detection is also performed for all classes jointly. Based on the learned sharing distributions of features among classes, we build a taxonomy of object classes. The taxonomy is then exploited to further reduce the cost of multi-class object detection. Our method has linear training and sublinear detection complexity in the number of classes. We have evaluated our method on the challenging PASCAL VOC'06 and PASCAL VOC'07 datasets and show that scaling the system does not lead to a loss in accuracy.},

abstract={Network Intrusion detection systems are essential for the protection of advanced communication networks. Originally, these systems were hard-coded to identify specific signatures, patterns and rule violations; now artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms provide promising alternatives. However, in the literature, various outdated datasets as well as a plethora of different evaluation metrics are used to prove algorithm efficacy. To enable a global comparison, this study compiles algorithms for different configurations to create common ground and proposes two new evaluation metrics. These metrics, the detection score and the identification score, together reliably present the performance of a network intrusion detection system to allow for practical comparison on a large scale. Additionally, we present a workflow to process raw packet flows into input features for machine learning. This framework quickly implements different algorithms for the various datasets and allows systematic performance comparison between those algorithms. Our experimental results, matching and surpassing the state-of-the-art, indicate the potential of this approach. As raw traffic input features are much easier and cheaper to extract when compared to traditional features, they show promise for application in real-time deep learning-based systems.},

abstract={This letter describes an end-to-end pipeline for tree diameter estimation based on semantic segmentation and lidar odometry and mapping. Accurate mapping of this type of environment is challenging since the ground and the trees are surrounded by leaves, thorns and vines, and the sensor typically experiences extreme motion. We propose a semantic feature based pose optimization that simultaneously refines the tree models while estimating the robot pose. The pipeline utilizes a custom virtual reality tool for labeling 3D scans that is used to train a semantic segmentation network. The masked point cloud is used to compute a trellis graph that identifies individual instances and extracts relevant features that are used by the SLAM module. We show that traditional lidar and image based methods fail in the forest environment on both Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and hand-carry systems, while our method is more robust, scalable, and automatically generates tree diameter estimations.},

pages={6011-6018},
abstract={Facial makeup style transfer is an extremely challenging sub-field of image-to-image-translation. Due to this difficulty, state-of-the-art results are mostly reliant on the Face Parsing Algorithm, which segments a face into parts in order to easily extract makeup features. However, this algorithm can only work well on high-definition images where facial features can be accurately extracted. Faces in many real-world photos, such as those including a large background or multiple people, are typically of low-resolution, which considerably hinders state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end holistic approach to effectively transfer makeup styles between two low-resolution images. The idea is built upon a novel weighted multi-scale spatial attention module, which identifies salient pixel regions on low-resolution images in multiple scales, and uses channel attention to determine the most effective attention map. This design provides two benefits: low-resolution images are usually blurry to different extents, so a multi-scale architecture can select the most effective convolution kernel size to implement spatial attention; makeup is applied on both a macro-level (foundation, fake tan) and a micro-level (eyeliner, lipstick) so different scales can excel in extracting different makeup features. We develop an Augmented CycleGAN network that embeds our attention modules at selected layers to most effectively transfer makeup. Our system is tested with the FBD data set, which consists of many low-resolution facial images, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in transferring makeup for blurry images and partially occluded images.},

We also studied practicability issues of well-established defense techniques against adversarial attacks and proposed some guidelines for better and effective solutions.

We do so by attacking the redacted faces in three scenarios: obscured face identification, verification, and reconstruction. Threat modeling is also considered to provide a vulnerability analysis for each studied obscuration technique. Based on our evaluation, we show that the k-same based methods are the most effective.},

abstract={Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has escalated the movement of big data across moving vehicles which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. In IoV environment, effective handling of streaming data has to face various challenges like; traffic monitoring, flow management, re-configuration and security. Software-defined networks (SDN) provides improved flexibility, and centralized control of the network to overcome (almost) the above-mentioned challenges. However, it can lead to an easy target (node or controller) for malicious agents. So, to detect the anomalous behaviour of the nodes in the IoV environment, a hybrid approach using probabilistic data structures is proposed which works in the following phases. In phase I, a traffic monitoring scheme using Count-Min-Sketch is designed to identify the suspicious nodes. In phase II, to detect an anomaly, a Bloom filter-based control scheme is used for signature verification of suspicious nodes. In phase III, a Quotient filter is used for fast and efficient storage of malicious nodes. In phase IV, to detect the super points (malicious hosts that are connected to a large number of destinations), a Hyperloglog counter is used to measure the cardinality of each flow passing through the switches. The proposed scheme has been evaluated in a simulated environment. The results obtained depict that the proposed scheme is faster, accurate, and efficient concerning detection ratio and false-positive ratio.},

In particular, we design an adversarial measurement generation approach that enables the attacker to report extremely low power consumption measurements to utilities while bypassing the ML energy theft detection. We evaluate our approach with three kinds of neural networks based on a real-world smart meter dataset.

abstract={For the past decade, security experts have warned that malicious engineers could modify hardware designs to include hardware back-doors (trojans), which, in turn, could grant attackers full control over a system. Proposed defenses to detect these attacks have been outpaced by the development of increasingly small, but equally dangerous, trojans. To thwart trojan-based attacks, we propose a novel architecture that maps the security-critical portions of a processor design to a one-time programmable, LUT-free fabric. The programmable fabric is automatically generated by analyzing the HDL of targeted modules. We present our tools to generate the fabric and map functionally equivalent designs onto the fabric. By having a trusted party randomly select a mapping and configure each chip, we prevent an attacker from knowing the physical location of targeted signals at manufacturing time. In addition, we provide decoy options (canaries) for the mapping of security-critical signals, such that hardware trojans hitting a decoy are thwarted and exposed. Using this defense approach, any trojan capable of analyzing the entire configurable fabric must employ complex logic functions with a large silicon footprint, thus exposing it to detection by inspection. We evaluated our solution on a RISC-V BOOM processor and demonstrated that, by providing the ability to map each critical signal to 6 distinct locations on the chip, we can reduce the chance of attack success by an undetectable trojan by 99%, incurring only a 27% area overhead.},

abstract={Percolation theory has been studied to investigate network resilience by identifying a critical value of node occupation probability where a giant component (i.e., a largest component in a network) represents high network resilience. However, the concept of network resilience studied in percolation theory has been limited to measuring network fault-tolerance in the presence of failures/attacks. In this work, we take a step to extend the concept of network resilience beyond fault-tolerance by introducing network adaptability. We consider a tactical network where a node is executing multiple tasks by belonging to multiple task groups. In this type of tactical networks, a node is limited with its resource while aiming to maximize its resource utilization and task execution without being overloaded. We investigate network resilience and resource utilization of the tactical network where the network is attacked by either infectious or non-infectious attacks. To mitigate the impact of the failed/attacked nodes in the network, we propose a suite of the proposed adaptation strategies to deal with correlated, cascading failures caused by overloaded nodes due to increased workload introduced by other failed nodes. We conduct a comparative performance analysis of the set of proposed adaptation strategies and a baseline scheme with no adaptation based on metrics including a size of a giant component, node resource utilization, a number of active tasks in execution, and adaptation cost. Our simulation results show that a large size of a giant component does not necessarily ensure high resource utilization of nodes and task performance in the given tactical network.},

The smart grid derives its functionality from several existing technologies and standards. At issue is that most of these base standards were developed for specific functionality and security was added later. As such, most standards do not have a unified and comprehensive approach to security, which results in security gaps in these standards. In this paper, we investigate common security issues in smart grid standards that employ communication protocols and the common causes for these issues. We then propose security considerations for developing these standards; to address them, we develop guidelines for drafting security into smart grid standards either when they are updated or when new standards are developed. We draw examples from the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile standard for security requirements, objectives, and to make recommendations for designing security in similar standards. We finally present a retrospective discussion of how following our recommendations would have improved the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile standard by including security in a unified and comprehensive way.},

abstract={The amount of video in the web is huge and searching specific part of a video can be achieved using a content or text based video indexing, grouping, searching and retrieval approaches. To realize content based video searching, in this work we propose scene based video annotation for the identification and labeling of events and objects in a video with a descriptive text. Video annotation requires a knowledge base to define semantic meaning of events and objects in the video. Manual and semi-supervised video annotation approaches fail as both require expertise for the correct identification and labeling of video concepts. Annotation requires a great deal of concept dependency and relatedness processing to give descriptive statement to a scene in the video. This paper introduces a novel scene based video annotation framework to provide scene level semantic description of videos. The framework uses audio component of the scene to support event and object identification and has proper filtering and normalization. The framework provides concept relatedness, concept formulation, shot and scene level video annotations. To validate the capability of the proposed framework, we developed a prototype that shows a scene level video annotation. The framework is evaluated using a standard video processing evaluation dataset for its accuracy in event and object prediction, and the overall accuracy and usability of the system is evaluated using human ratings. The proposed approach exhibits 81% accuracy in object and event prediction and an average user rating of 3.47 out of 4 in overall system evaluation.},

As a result, all vulnerable message fields that could be tampered with during transmission are protected by our method. The proposed SIDM is lightweight and deployable in a distributed environment.

abstract={Physical layer security (PLS) has emerged as a new concept and powerful alternative that can complement and may even replace encryption-based approaches, which entail many hurdles and practical problems for future wireless systems. The basic idea of PLS is to exploit the characteristics of the wireless channel and its impairments including noise, fading, interference, dispersion, diversity, etc. in order to ensure the ability of the intended user to successfully perform data decoding while preventing eavesdroppers from doing so. Thus, the main design goal of PLS is to increase the performance difference between the link of the legitimate receiver and that of the eavesdropper by using well-designed transmission schemes. In this survey, we propose a conceptual, generic, and expandable framework for classifying the existing PLS techniques against wireless passive eavesdropping. In this flexible framework, the security techniques that we comprehensively review in this treatise are divided into two primary approaches: signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-based approach and complexity-based approach. The first approach is classified into three major categories: first, secrecy channel codes-based schemes; second, security techniques based on channel adaptation; third, schemes based on injecting interfering artificial (noise/jamming) signals along with the transmitted information signals. The second approach (complexity-based), which is associated with the mechanisms of extracting secret sequences from the shared channel, is classified into two main categories based on which layer the secret sequence obtained by channel quantization is applied on. The techniques belonging to each one of these categories are divided and classified into three main signal domains: time, frequency and space. For each one of these domains, several examples are given and illustrated along with the review of the state-of-the-art security advances in each domain. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach alongside the lessons learned from existing research works are stated and discussed. The recent applications of PLS techniques to different emerging communication systems such as visible light communication, body area network, power line communication, Internet of Things, smart grid, mm-Wave, cognitive radio, vehicular ad-hoc network, unmanned aerial vehicle, ultra-wideband, device-to-device, radio-frequency identification, index modulation, and 5G non-orthogonal multiple access based-systems, are also reviewed and discussed. The paper is concluded with recommendations and future research directions for designing robust, efficient and strong security methods for current and future wireless systems.},

abstract={CAPTCHA is a web-based authentication method used by websites to distinguish between humans (valid users) and bots (attackers). Audio captcha is an accessible captcha meant for the visually disabled section of users such as color-blind, blind, near-sighted users. Firstly, this paper analyzes how secure current audio captchas are from attacks using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Each audio captcha is made up of five, seven or ten random digits[0-9] spoken one after the other along with varying background noise throughout the length of the audio. If the ML or DL model is able to correctly identify all spoken digits and in the correct order of occurance in a single audio captcha, we consider that captcha to be broken and the attack to be successful. Throughout the paper, accuracy refers to the attack model's success at breaking audio captchas. The higher the attack accuracy, the more unsecure the audio captchas are. In our baseline experiments, we found that attack models could break audio captchas that had no background noise or medium background noise with any number of spoken digits with nearly 99% to 100% accuracy. Whereas, audio captchas with high background noise were relatively more secure with attack accuracy of 85%. Secondly, we propose that the concepts of adversarial examples algorithms can be used to create a new kind of audio captcha that is more resilient towards attacks. We found that even after retraining the models on the new adversarial audio data, the attack accuracy remained as low as 25% to 36% only. Lastly, we explore the benefits of creating adversarial audio captcha through different algorithms such as Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and deepFool. We found that as long as the attacker has less than 45% sample from each kinds of adversarial audio datasets, the defense will be successful at preventing attacks.},

abstract={Smartwatches are expected to become the world's best-selling electronic product after smartphones. Various smart-watches have been released to the private consumer market, but the data on smartwatches is not well protected. In this paper, we show for the first time that photoplethysmography (PPG)signals influenced by hand gestures can be used to authenticate users on smartwatches. The insight is that muscle and tendon movements caused by hand gestures compress the arterial geometry with different degrees, which has a significant impact on the blood flow. Based on this insight, novel approaches are proposed to detect the starting point and ending point of the hand gesture from raw PPG signals and determine if these PPG signals are from a normal user or an attacker. Different from existing solutions, our approach leverages the PPG sensors that are available on most smartwatches and does not need to collect training data from attackers. Also, our system can be used in more general scenarios wherever users can perform hand gestures and is robust against shoulder surfing attacks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of our system and show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 96.31 % and an average true rejection rate of at least 91.64% against two types of attacks.},

abstract={Malicious software, popularly known as malware, is widely acknowledged as a serious threat to modern computing systems. Software-based solutions, such as anti-virus software, are not effective since they rely on matching patterns that can be easily fooled by carefully crafted malware with obfuscation or other deviation capabilities. While recent malware detection methods provide promising results through effective utilization of hardware features, the detection results cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way. In this paper, we propose a hardware-assisted malware detection framework using explainable machine learning. This paper makes three important contributions. First, we theoretically establish that our proposed method can provide interpretable explanation of classification results to address the challenge of transparency. Next, we show that the explainable outcome can lead to accurate localization of malicious behaviors. Finally, experimental evaluation using a wide variety of realworld malware benchmarks demonstrates that our framework can produce accurate and human-understandable malware detection results with provable guarantees.},

abstract={Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes.},

abstract={Cybercrime is growing at a rapid pace, and its techniques are becoming more sophisticated. In order to actively cope with such threats, new approaches based on machine learning and requiring less administrator intervention have been proposed, but there are still many technical difficulties in detecting security attacks in real time. To solve this problem, we propose a new machine learning-based real-time intrusion detection algorithm. Unlike the existing approaches, the one proposed can detect the presence of an attack every time a packet is received, enabling real-time detection. In addition, our algorithm effectively reduces the system load, which may significantly increase from real-time detection, compared to non-real-time detection. In the algorithm, the increase in the number of memory accesses can be minimized (to below 30 %) compared to conventional methods. Since the proposed method is pure software-based approach, it has excellent scalability and flexibility against various attacks. Therefore, the proposed method cannot support the high classification performance of the hardware-based method but also the high flexibility of the software-based method simultaneously, it can effectively detect and prevent various cyber-attacks.},

As technology reaches everywhere, anyone can misuse it, and it is always essential to secure it. In this work we present a denial-of-service (DoS) detection architecture for 6LoWPAN, the standard protocol designed by IETF as an adaptation layer for low-power lossy networks enabling low-power devices to communicate with the Internet. The proposed architecture integrates an intrusion detection system (IDS) into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project ebbits. The aim is to detect DoS attacks based on 6LoWPAN. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, preliminary implementation was completed and tested against a real DoS attack using a penetration testing system. The paper concludes with the related results proving to be successful in detecting DoS attacks on 6LoWPAN. Further, extending the IDS could lead to detect more complex attacks on 6LoWPAN.},

abstract={Most automated facial expression analysis methods treat the face as a 2D object, flat like a sheet of paper. That works well provided images are frontal or nearly so. In real-world conditions, moderate to large head rotation is common and system performance to recognize expression degrades. Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to increase robustness to pose, but they require greater model sizes and may generalize poorly across views that are not included in the training set. We propose FACSCaps architecture to handle multi-view and multi-label facial action unit (AU) detection within a single model that can generalize to novel views. Additionally, FACSCaps's ability to synthesize faces enables insights into what is leaned by the model. FACSCaps models video frames using matrix capsules, where hierarchical pose relationships between face parts are built into internal representations. The model is trained by jointly optimizing a multi-label loss and the reconstruction accuracy. FACSCaps was evaluated using the FERA 2017 facial expression dataset that includes spontaneous facial expressions in a wide range of head orientations. FACSCaps outperformed both state-of-the-art CNNs and their temporal extensions.},

abstract={Cloud computing is gaining ground and becoming one of the fast growing segments of the IT industry. However, if its numerous advantages are mainly used to support a legitimate activity, it is now exploited for a use it was not meant for: malicious users leverage its power and fast provisioning to turn it into an attack support. Botnets supporting DDoS attacks are among the greatest beneficiaries of this malicious use since they can be setup on demand and at very large scale without requiring a long dissemination phase nor an expensive deployment costs. For cloud service providers, preventing their infrastructure from being turned into an Attack as a Service delivery model is very challenging since it requires detecting threats at the source, in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous environment. In this paper, we present the result of an experiment campaign we performed in order to understand the operational behavior of a botcloud used for a DDoS attack. The originality of our work resides in the consideration of system metrics that, while never considered for state-of-the-art botnets detection, can be leveraged in the context of a cloud to enable a source based detection. Our study considers both attacks based on TCP-flood and UDP-storm and for each of them, we provide statistical results based on a principal component analysis, that highlight the recognizable behavior of a botcloud as compared to other legitimate workloads.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel semisupervised scheme for abnormality detection and segmentation in medical images. Semisupervised learning does not require pathology modeling and, thus, allows high degree of automation. In abnormality detection, a vector is characterized as anomalous if it does not comply with the probability distribution obtained from normal data. The estimation of the probability density function, however, is usually not feasible due to large data dimensionality. In order to overcome this challenge, we treat every image as a network of locally coherent image partitions (overlapping blocks). We formulate and maximize a strictly concave likelihood function estimating abnormality for each partition and fuse the local estimates into a globally optimal estimate that satisfies the consistency constraints, based on a distributed estimation algorithm. The likelihood function consists of a model and a data term and is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. The method is applied for automatically segmenting brain pathologies, such as simulated brain infarction and dysplasia, as well as real lesions in diabetes patients. The assessment of the method using receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrates improvement in image segmentation over two-group analysis performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).},

abstract={Knowing the course of the road, together with the corresponding road boundaries is an essential component of many advanced driver-assistance systems and of autonomous vehicles. This work presents an indirect grid-based approach for road course estimation. Due to the grid representation, it is independent of specific features or particular sensors and is able to handle continuous as well as sparse road boundaries of arbitrary shape. Furthermore, the number of road courses in the scene is determined to detect road junctions and forks in the road, and the boundaries of each road course are individually estimated. The approach is based on local path planning and path clustering to find the principal moving directions through the environment. They separate the boundaries and are used for their extraction. The set of local paths and principal moving directions is reduced with approximate knowledge of the road velocity paired with system constraints, and validation and tracking assure the required robustness. Experimental results from autonomous navigation of a vehicle through an unmapped road construction site as well as quantitative evaluations demonstrate the performance of the method.},

abstract={Currently, Machine Learning (ML) is becoming ubiquitous in everyday life. Deep Learning (DL) is already present in many applications ranging from computer vision for medicine to autonomous driving of modern cars as well as other sectors in security, healthcare, and finance. However, to achieve impressive performance, these algorithms employ very deep networks, requiring a significant computational power, both during the training and inference time. A single inference of a DL model may require billions of multiply-and-accumulated operations, making the DL extremely compute- and energy-hungry. In a scenario where several sophisticated algorithms need to be executed with limited energy and low latency, the need for cost-effective hardware platforms capable of implementing energy-efficient DL execution arises. This paper first introduces the key properties of two brain-inspired models like Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Spiking Neural Network (SNN), and then analyzes techniques to produce efficient and high-performance designs. This work summarizes and compares the works for four leading platforms for the execution of algorithms such as CPU, GPU, FPGA and ASIC describing the main solutions of the state-of-the-art, giving much prominence to the last two solutions since they offer greater design flexibility and bear the potential of high energy-efficiency, especially for the inference process. In addition to hardware solutions, this paper discusses some of the important security issues that these DNN and SNN models may have during their execution, and offers a comprehensive section on benchmarking, explaining how to assess the quality of different networks and hardware systems designed for them.},

abstract={Writing rules to capture precisely fraudulent transactions is a challenging task where domain experts spend significant effort and time. A key observation is that much of this difficulty originates from the fact that such experts typically work as "lone rangers" or in isolated groups, or work on detecting frauds in one context in isolation from frauds that occur in another context. However, in practice there is a lot of commonality in what different experts are trying to achieve. In this paper, we present the GOLDRUSH system, which facilitates knowledge sharing via effective adaptation of fraud detection rules from one context to another. GOLDRUSH abstracts the possible semantic interpretations of each of the conditions in the rules at the source context and adapts them to the target context. Efficient algorithms are used to identify the most effective rule adaptations w.r.t a given cost-benefit metric. Our extensive set of experiments, based on real-world financial datasets, demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution, both in terms of the accuracy of the fraud detection and the actual money saved.},

To produce an efficient representation of the environment, the proposed perception algorithm is desired to cluster point cloud data to planar regions composed of convex polygons. We describe in this paper the end-to-end pipeline from data collection to generation of the regions, where we first compose an octree in order to create a more efficient data representation. We then group the leaves in the tree using a nearest neighbor search into a planar region, which is composed of the concave hull of points that is decomposed into convex polygons. We present a variety of environments, and illustrate the usability of this approach by the Atlas humanoid robots walking over rough terrain.

To achieve an optimal automatic meeting analysis, we previously proposed an all-neural approach that jointly solves source separation, speaker diarization and source counting problems in an optimal way (in a sense that all the 3 tasks can be jointly optimized through error back-propagation). It was shown that the method could well handle simulated clean (noiseless and anechoic) dialog-like data, and achieved very good performance in comparison with several conventional methods. However, it was not clear whether such all-neural approach would be successfully generalized to more complicated real meeting data containing more spontaneously-speaking speakers, severe noise and reverberation, and how it performs in comparison with the state-of-the-art systems in such scenarios. In this paper, we first consider practical issues required for improving the robustness of the all-neural approach, and then experimentally show that, even in real meeting scenarios, the all-neural approach can perform effective speech enhancement, and simultaneously outperform state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract={Federated learning (FL), as a privacy-preserving machine learning framework, draws growing attention in both industry and academia. It obtains a jointly accurate model by distributing training tasks into data owners and aggregating their model updates. However, FL faces new security problems, as it losses direct control to training processes. One fundamental demand is to ensure whether participants execute training tasks as intended.In this paper, we propose TrustFL, a practical scheme that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to build assurance of participants' training executions with high confidence. Specifically, we use TEE to randomly check a small fraction of all training processes for tunable levels of assurance, while all computations are executed on the co-located faster yet insecure processor (e.g., GPU) for efficiency. To prevent various cheating behaviors like only processing TEE-requested computations or uploading old results, we devise a commitment-based method with specific data selection. We prototype TrustFL using GPU and SGX and evaluate its performance. The results show that TrustFL achieves one/two orders of magnitude speedups compared with naive training with SGX, when assuring correct training with a confidence level of 99%.},

At the core of an IRS is the response selection algorithm, which selects the best response action to counter the currently detected attack. Most of the IRSs proposed so far, statically or dynamically evaluate the mapping between response actions and specific attacks, ignoring the actual system state, thus providing only short-term decisions. In this paper we propose a controller based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) for an autonomic IRS. The proposed controller is able to compose atomic response actions to create optimal long-term response policies to protect a system. Experimental results show that long-term policies are always more effective than short-term policies and that they can reduce the threat resolution time up to 56% in the considered scenario.},

abstract={User authentication based on fingerprints is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Recent research has demonstrated the possibility of generating a small number of “MasterPrints” that can fortuitously match the fingerprints of a large number of identities. The problem is particularly exacerbated for partial prints such as those used in smartphones. Such systems often store multiple templates per user (e.g., multiple impressions of a single finger) to compensate for the limited size of the sensor, variation in finger placement, and other types of intra-class variations. The presence of multiple templates, however, increases their chances of matching against a MasterPrint thereby compromising security. This paper presents a novel technique to perform template selection in such a way that the chance of MasterPrint attack gets reduced. Experiments conducted using a commercial fingerprint matcher on two datasets indicate that the proposed approach can be effective against MasterPrint attacks whilst retaining verification performance.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been a subject of extensive research and have undergone explosive growth in the last few years. WSNs utilize collaborative measures such as data gathering, aggregation, processing, and management of sensing activities for enhanced performance. In order to communicate with the sink node, node having low power may have to traverse multi-hops. This requires neighbors' nodes to be used as relays. However, if the relay nodes are compromised or malicious, they may leak confidential information to unauthorized nodes in the WSN. Moreover, in many WSN applications, the deployment of sensor nodes is carried out in an ad-hoc fashion without careful examination. In such networks it is desirable to ensure the source to sink privacy and maximize the lifetime of the network, by finding secure energy-efficient route discovery and forwarding mechanisms. Careful management is also necessary, as processing required for secure routing is distributed over multiple nodes. An important consideration in this regard is energy-aware secure routing, which is significant in ensuring smooth operation of WSNs. As, these networks deal in sensitive data and are vulnerable to attack, it is important to make them secure against various types of threats. However, resource constraints could make the design, deployment and management of large WSNs a challenging proposition. The purpose of this paper is to highlight routing based security threats, provide a detailed assessment of existing solutions and present a Trust-based Energy Efficient Secure Routing Protocol (TEESR). The paper also highlights future research directions in of secure routing in multi-hop WSNs.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is advanced technology for resource sharing through network with less cost as compare to other technologies. Cloud infrastructure supports various models IaaS, SaaS, PaaS. Today the most important technique used in cloud computing is the concept of virtualization. By using virtualization, more than one operating system is supported with all resources on single hardware. In addition, the virtualization technology has limit security capabilities in order to secure wide area cloud environment. Sharing of one database to many tenants is known as Multi tenancy. Multi-tenancy is achieved by utilizing virtualization and allowing resource sharing where Multi-tenancy is seen differently from different service models. To secure cloud infrastructure a hypervisor based virtualization is used. This paper describes the various virtual machine security attacks and analysis the various attacks based on hypervisor security in virtualization environment.},

abstract={Assessing quality of products, especially when purchased online, is always a challenge. One of the widely used approaches for addressing this challenge is to rely on the scores computed by online rating systems, based on the feedback received from other users. For several reasons, like gaining benefits, personal interests or collusion, rating systems have always been facing with challenge of dishonest feedback. Although many techniques have been proposed for collusion detection, there are still issues that need more investigations. One of these issues is dealing with the sparsity problem, i.e., small number of votes per product, which makes it easier to manipulate scores. In this paper we propose a novel technique for calculating robust rank scores which relies on feedback prediction. In our model, we improve quality of computed scores by predicting feedback, for the people who have not assessed a product. This will result in decreasing sparsity. Then, we propose an iterative technique to calculate product rating scores based on the real and predicted feedbacks. We have implemented our method and compared its performance with three well-known related works. The result of comparison shows the superiority of our model.},

We give a description of existing security attacks in WSNs and the corresponding proposed IDS protocols to tackle those attacks. We analyze the works with respect to the network structure of WSNs. In addition, we highlight various critical shortcomings that IDSs currently have and define future research tracks for IDSs in wireless sensor networks. Though a few restricted survey works on this topic have already been done, we feel that there is a great need of performing a detailed and comprehensive study on the vital aspects so that the IDS in WSN could be analyzed from all the `need-to-know' angles.

abstract={Phishing websites have long been a serious threat to cyber security. For decades, many researchers have been devoted to developing novel techniques to detect phishing websites automatically. While state-of-the-art solutions can achieve superior performances, they require substantial manual feature engineering and are not adept at detecting newly emerging phishing attacks. Therefore, developing techniques that can detect phishing websites automatically and handle zero-day phishing attacks swiftly is still an open challenge in this area. In this work, we propose PhishingNet, a deep learning-based approach for timely detection of phishing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Specifically, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module to extract character-level spatial feature representations of URLs; meanwhile, we employ an attention-based hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) module to extract word-level temporal feature representations of URLs. We then fuse these feature representations via a three-layer CNN to build accurate feature representations of URLs, on which we train a phishing URL classifier. Extensive experiments on a verified dataset collected from the Internet demonstrate that the feature representations extracted automatically are conducive to the improvement of the generalization ability of our approach on newly emerging URLs, which makes our approach achieve competitive performance against other state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract={Feature matching quality strongly influences the accuracy of most computer vision tasks. This led to impressive advances in keypoint detection, descriptor calculation, and feature matching itself. To compare different approaches and evaluate their quality, datasets from related tasks are used. Unfortunately, none of these datasets actually provide ground truth (GT) feature matches. Thus, matches can only be approximated due to repeatability errors of keypoint detectors and inaccuracies of GT. In this paper, we introduce ground truth matches (GTM) for several well known datasets. Based on the provided spacial ground truth, we automatically generate them using popular feature types. Currently, feature matching evaluation is typically performed using precision and recall. The introduced GTM additionally enable evaluation with accuracy and fall-out. The datasets were manually annotated, on the one hand to evaluate the precision and unambiguousness of the GTM, and on the other hand to determine the accuracy of the ground truth provided with the datasets. Using GTM, we present an evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art keypoint-descriptor combinations as well as matching algorithms.},

abstract={Digital images have become very important in our daily lives and some other important areas such as medicine, journalism and it can be also used as forensic evidence. However, the simplicity of using digital images with freely available software tools makes the authenticity of images questionable. The most common image forgery type is copy move forgery because it can be done easily but the detection of this type of forgery is hard. Various approaches are proposed in literature to detection of copy move forgery, but lots of them is not satisfy result especially smooth regions are used to hide objects. And lots of works use experience parameters values so sometimes they cannot detect forgery operations. To solve these problems we proposed an optimized keypoint based copy move forgery detection methods based on Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance even under post processing and preprocessing attacks (such as blurring, noise addition, rotation, JPEG compression).},

Power-in-band features were estimated by a method using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). In addition, entropy, spectral entropy, fractal dimensions and statistical features were used as the input of classifiers. Inter-personal differences and the characteristics of extracted features were evaluated for individual sleep classes. Two expert-in-the-loop strategies and three different classifiers were used to classify data into sleep stages. The results were compared with a fully automated classification and with gold standard expert sleep staging. Due to the proposed improvements the final mean classification sensitivity of expert-in-the-loop approach was increased up to 18.4%. The implemented solution allows to classify sleep recordings contaminated by a large amount of the naturally occurring artifacts that are impossible to process by traditional automated classification methods.},

abstract={A major rise in the prevalence and influence of colorectal cancer (CRC) leads to substantially increasing healthcare costs and even death. It is widely accepted that early detection and removal of colonic polyps can prevent CRC. Detection of colonic polyps in colonoscopy videos is problematic because of complex environment of colon and various shapes of polyps. Currently, researchers indicate feasibility of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based detection of polyps but better feature extractors are needed to improve detection performance. In this paper, we investigated the potential of the single shot detector (SSD) framework for detecting polyps in colonoscopy videos. SSD is a one-stage method, which uses a feed-forward CNN to produce a collection of fixed-size bounding boxes for each object from different feature maps. Three different feature extractors, including ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3 were assessed. Multi-scale feature maps integrated into SSD were designed for ResNet50 and InceptionV3, respectively. We validated this method on the 2015 MICCAI polyp detection challenge datasets, compared it with teams attended the challenge, YOLOV3 and two-stage method, Faster-RCNN. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method surpassed all the teams in MICCAI challenge and YOLOV3 and was comparable with two-stage method. Especially in detection speed aspect, our proposed method outperformed all the methods, met real-time application requirement. Meanwhile, we also indicated that among all the feature extractors, InceptionV3 obtained the best result of precision and recall. In conclusion, SSD- based method achieved excellent detection performance in polyp detection and can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract={With the rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19 and COVID-20), wearing face masks in public becomes a necessity to mitigate the transmission of this or other pandemics. However, with the lack of on-ground automated prevention measures, depending on humans to enforce face mask-wearing policies in universities and other organizational buildings, is a very costly and time-consuming measure. Without addressing this challenge, mitigating highly airborne transmittable diseases will be impractical, and the time to react will continue to increase. Considering the high personnel traffic in buildings and the effectiveness of countermeasures, that is, detecting and offering unmasked personnel with surgical masks, our aim in this paper is to develop automated detection of unmasked personnel in public spaces in order to respond by providing a surgical mask to them to promptly remedy the situation. Our approach consists of three key components. The first component utilizes a deep learning architecture that integrates deep residual learning (ResNet-50) with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to detect the existence of human subjects in the videos (or video feed). The second component utilizes Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Networks (MT-CNN) to detect and extract human faces from these videos. For the third component, we construct and train a convolutional neural network classifier to detect masked and unmasked human subjects. Our techniques were implemented in a mobile robot, Thor, and evaluated using a dataset of videos collected by the robot from public spaces of an educational institute in the U.S. Our evaluation results show that Thor is very accurate achieving an F1 score of 87.7% with a recall of 99.2% in a variety of situations, a reasonable accuracy given the challenging dataset and the problem domain.},

abstract={Demands on capturing dynamic scenes of underwater environments are rapidly growing. Passive stereo is applicable to capture dynamic scenes, however the shape with textureless surfaces or irregular reflections cannot be recovered by the technique. In our system, we add a pattern projector to the stereo camera pair so that artificial textures are augmented on the objects. To use the system at underwater environments, several problems should be compensated, i.e., refraction, disturbance by fluctuation and bubbles. Further, since surface of the objects are interfered by the bubbles, projected patterns, etc., those noises and patterns should be removed from captured images to recover original texture. To solve these problems, we propose three approaches; a depth-dependent calibration, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)-stereo method and CNN-based texture recovery method. A depth-dependent calibration I sour analysis to find the acceptable depth range for approximation by center projection to find the certain target depth for calibration. In terms of CNN stereo, unlike common CNN based stereo methods which do not consider strong disturbances like refraction or bubbles, we designed a novel CNN architecture for stereo matching using multi-scale information, which is intended to be robust against such disturbances. Finally, we propose a multi-scale method for bubble and a projected-pattern removal method using CNNs to recover original textures. Experimental results are shown to prove the effectiveness of our method compared with the state of the art techniques. Furthermore, reconstruction of a live swimming fish is demonstrated to confirm the feasibility of our techniques.},

abstract={Distinctive visual cues are of central importance for image retrieval applications, in particular, in the context of visual location recognition. While in indoor environments typically only few distinctive features can be found, outdoors dynamic objects and clutter significantly impair the retrieval performance. We present an approach which exploits text, a major source of information for humans during orientation and navigation, without the need for error-prone optical character recognition. To this end, characters are detected and described using robust feature descriptors like SURF. By quantizing them into several hundred visual words we consider the distinctive appearance of the characters rather than reducing the set of possible features to an alphabet. Writings in images are transformed to strings of visual words termed visual phrases, which provide significantly improved distinctiveness when compared to individual features. An approximate string matching is performed using N-grams, which can be efficiently combined with an inverted file structure to cope with large datasets. An experimental evaluation on three different datasets shows significant improvement of the retrieval performance while reducing the size of the database by two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art. Its low computational complexity makes the approach particularly suited for mobile image retrieval applications.},

In this paper, we attempt to investigate whether Twitter trends are secure from the manipulation of malicious users. We collect more than 69 million tweets from 5 million accounts. Using the collected tweets, we first conduct a data analysis and discover evidence of Twitter trend manipulation. Then, we study at the topic level and infer the key factors that can determine whether a topic starts trending due to its popularity, coverage, transmission, potential coverage, or reputation. What we find is that except for transmission, all of factors above are closely related to trending. Finally, we further investigate the trending manipulation from the perspective of compromised and fake accounts and discuss countermeasures.},

abstract={The massive adoption of hand-held devices has led to the explosion of mobile traffic volumes traversing home and enterprise networks, as well as the Internet. Traffic classification (TC), i.e., the set of procedures for inferring (mobile) applications generating such traffic, has become nowadays the enabler for highly valuable profiling information (with certain privacy downsides), other than being the workhorse for service differentiation/blocking. Nonetheless, the design of accurate classifiers is exacerbated by the raising adoption of encrypted protocols (such as TLS), hindering the suitability of (effective) deep packet inspection approaches. Also, the fast-expanding set of apps and the moving-target nature of mobile traffic makes design solutions with usual machine learning, based on manually and expert-originated features, outdated and unable to keep the pace. For these reasons deep learning (DL) is here proposed, for the first time, as a viable strategy to design practical mobile traffic classifiers based on automatically extracted features, able to cope with encrypted traffic, and reflecting their complex traffic patterns. To this end, different state-of-the-art DL techniques from (standard) TC are here reproduced, dissected (highlighting critical choices), and set into a systematic framework for comparison, including also a performance evaluation workbench. The latter outcome, although declined in the mobile context, has the applicability appeal to the wider umbrella of encrypted TC tasks. Finally, the performance of these DL classifiers is critically investigated based on an exhaustive experimental validation (based on three mobile datasets of real human users' activity), highlighting the related pitfalls, design guidelines, and challenges.},

abstract={Solar cells defects inspection plays an important role to ensure the efficiency and lifespan of photovoltaic modules. However, it is still an arduous task because of the diverse attributes of electroluminescence images, such as indiscriminative complex background with extremely unbalanced defects and various types of defects. In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a new precise and accurate defect inspection method for photovoltaic electroluminescence (EL) images. The proposed algorithm leverages the advantage of multi attention network to efficiently extract the most important features and neglect the nonessential features during training. Firstly, we designed a channel attention to exploit contextual representations and spatial attention to effectively suppress background noise. Secondly, we incorporate both attention networks into modified U-net architecture and named it multi attention U-net (MAU-net) to extract effective multiscale features for defects inspection. Finally, we propose a hybrid loss which combines focal loss and dice loss aiming to solve two problems: a) overcome the class imbalance problem, and b) allowing the network to train with irregular image labels for some complex defects. The proposed multi attention U-net is evaluated on real photovoltaic EL images datasets using 5-fold cross validation technique. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network can segment and detect various complex defects correctly. The proposed method achieved the mean intersection over-union (m-IOU) of 0.699 and F-measure of 0.799 which outperforms the previous methods.},

pages={3571-3585},
abstract={Radio-frequency identification (RFID) system, successfully adopted in many industrial applications, suffers from security issues due to the inherent weakness of wireless communication, such as eavesdropping, replay attack, impersonation attack, and traceability issues. A lot of research efforts based on cryptographic primitives have been conducted in a decade, however, most of the existing security protocols depending on cryptosystems are not feasible to be applied due to the minimalist design of passive tags. A lightweight cryptographic authentication is one of the practical solutions, but it has traceability issues from physical layer information. The other approach is to use the properties of the physical layer of RFID systems. However, since the physical-layer characteristics cannot be intentionally updated, they are vulnerable to situations where an adversary actively obtains authentic data for traceability attacks or replay attacks. Therefore, to resist the security threats, we propose Tagora, a cross-layer authentication protocol, which is the first integration work of two-layer approaches that harness the unpredictable properties of tag's collision responses at both the physical and application layers. Our protocol design is composed of a collision recovery algorithm with a random offset scheme and phase encryption in the physical layer, and authentication process based on a challenge-response mechanism in the application layer. We evaluate Tagora in terms of the untraceability and reliability, and also provide security analysis on how Tagora can defend against plausible attacks while meeting security requirements.},

To tackle this problem, we propose a non-linear radial basis convolutional feature mapping by learning a Mahalanobis-like distance function. Our method then maps the convolutional features onto a linearly well-separated manifold, which prevents small adversarial perturbations from forcing a sample to cross the decision boundary. We test the proposed method on three publicly available image classification and segmentation datasets namely, MNIST, ISBI ISIC 2017 skin lesion segmentation, and NIH Chest X-Ray-14. We evaluate the robustness of our method to different gradient (targeted and untargeted) and non-gradient based attacks and compare it to several non-gradient masking defense strategies. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can increase the resilience of deep convolutional neural networks to adversarial perturbations without accuracy drop on clean data.},

abstract={Since the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology have attracted an increasing interest from both academia and industry. Among various core components, consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.},

abstract={Localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has drawn growing attention from the researchers and a number of localization schemes have been proposed to discover the locations of regular sensors based on a few beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their locations through GPS or manual configuration. However, the localization process is vulnerable to malicious attacks aimed at interrupting the functionality of location-aware applications. The wormhole attack is a particularly challenging one since the external adversary which acts in passive mode, does not need to compromise any nodes or have access to any cryptographic keys. In this paper, wormhole attack in DV-hop is discussed, and a Wormhole-free DV-hop Localization scheme (WFDV) is proposed to defend wormhole attack in proactive countermeasure. Using analysis and simulation, we show that our solution is effective in detecting and defending against wormhole attacks with a high detection rate.},

abstract={Deep neural networks have been shown to exhibit an intriguing vulnerability to adversarial input images corrupted with imperceptible perturbations. However, the majority of adversarial attacks assume global, fine-grained control over the image pixel space. In this paper, we consider a different setting: what happens if the adversary could only alter specific attributes of the input image? These would generate inputs that might be perceptibly different, but still natural-looking and enough to fool a classifier. We propose a novel approach to generate such ``semantic'' adversarial examples by optimizing a particular adversarial loss over the range-space of a parametric conditional generative model. We demonstrate implementations of our attacks on binary classifiers trained on face images, and show that such natural-looking semantic adversarial examples exist. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack on synthetic and real data, and present detailed comparisons with existing attack methods. We supplement our empirical results with theoretical bounds that demonstrate the existence of such parametric adversarial examples.},

abstract={Federated Learning (FL) is currently the most widely adopted framework for collaborative training of (deep) machine learning models under privacy constraints. Albeit it's popularity, it has been observed that Federated Learning yields suboptimal results if the local clients' data distributions diverge. The recently proposed Clustered Federated Learning Framework addresses this issue, by separating the client population into different groups based on the pairwise cosine similarities between their parameter updates. In this work we investigate the application of CFL to byzantine settings, where a subset of clients behaves unpredictably or tries to disturb the joint training effort in an directed or undirected way. We perform experiments with deep neural networks on common Federated Learning datasets which demonstrate that CFL (without modifications) is able to reliably detect byzantine clients and remove them from training.},

abstract={Despite the ubiquity in the use of biometrics due to its many advantages against traditional methods such as password or token, the emerging cancelable biometric methods, which are designed to protect the biometrics are still exposed to certain threats. Attack via Record Multiplicity (ARM) is one of those. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that possesses two layers of authentication to improve the matching performance of a fingerprint authentication system in the cancelable template setting. In addition, a multi-filter fingerprint matching scheme is devised to deal more effectively with low-quality fingerprint images. Two techniques that are capable of defending against the heinous ARM are also introduced. Security analysis on the system’s capability against the hill-climb attack and pre-image attack is also provided. The proposed scheme has been evaluated over public datasets FVC2002-DB1, FVC2002-DB2, FVC2002-DB3, and FVC2004-DB2. It has achieved the best result compared with the state-of-art methods.

year={2020},
volume={8},

pages={205766-205777},
abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in various applications due to their strong expressive power. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and these manipulated instances can mislead DNN into making false predictions. The existing methods of generating adversarial examples include pixel-level perturbation or spatial transformation of images, which cannot consider concurrently with the semantic quality of adversarial examples or success rate of attack. These methods are computationally bulky and slow to generate the adversarial examples. To solve this kind of issue, a two-stage generative adversarial networks (TSGAN) with semantic content constraints is proposed in this paper. The first-stage uses the original example dataset to train generator G, which can help the generator learn the distribution of real examples. Then, the example semantic quality constraint loss function, the adversarial loss function and the distance loss function are adopted in the second-stage, so that the generator G can continue to learn to search the distribution of the adversarial examples, and train the new generator Gadv. The adversarial examples generated by generator Gadv are better fit the distribution of real examples, and have targeted black-box attack capability. The experiments show that the adversarial examples generated by TSGAN can achieve the success rate of attack at 98.40% in target model, 29.40% success rate in defense-oriented model. And 77.58% success rate is obtained in the transfer test attack. The results show that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed model, which has a highly attack success rate and more difficult to defense. Meanwhile, the improved adversarial examples have stronger transfer ability than the existing models. The proposed model can effectively reduce the expression of target category features of the adversarial examples, and the generated adversarial examples have better semantic quality than others.},

abstract={The algorithms and models of traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) perform very well in terms of the availability and accuracy of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) under good signal conditions. Research is still ongoing to improve their robustness and performance in less than optimal signal environments. A growing interest in the study of machine learning (ML) and the potential for its application in many fields has also led to several types of research on its utilization in GNSSs. In the field of GNSSs, ML is changing the ways that navigation problems are prevented and resolved, and it is taking on a significant role in advancing PNT technologies for the future. We illustrate this point by reviewing how ML can enhance GNSS performance and usability and also discuss areas of GNSSs in which ML algorithms have been applied. We also highlight the commonly implemented ML algorithms and compare their performance when used in similar GNSS use cases. In addition, the challenges and risks of the utilization of ML techniques in GNSSs are discussed. Insight is given into prospective areas in GNSSs in which ML can be applied for increased performance, accuracy and robustness, thereby providing fertile ground for novel research.},

abstract={As malware family classification methods, image-based classification methods have attracted much attention. Especially, due to the fast classification speed and the high classification accuracy, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based malware family classification methods have been studied. However, previous studies on CNN-based classification methods focused only on improving the classification accuracy of malware families. That is, previous studies did not consider the cases that the accuracy of CNN-based malware classification methods can be decreased under the existence of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of various CNN-based malware family classification models under adversarial attacks. While adding imperceptible non-random perturbations to the input image, we measured how the accuracy of the CNN-based malware family classification model can be affected. Also, we showed the influence of three significant visualization parameters(i.e., the size of input image, dimension of input image, and conversion color of a special character)on the accuracy variation under adversarial attacks. From the evaluation results using the Microsoft malware dataset, we showed that even the accuracy over 98% of the CNN-based malware family classification method can be decreased to less than 7%.},

abstract={Fuzzy testing technology has a good effect in discovering web vulnerabilities, which is incomparable with other security testing technologies. Because of the randomness and unpredictability of its test cases, it can dig out the relevant vulnerabilities comprehensively and systematically. Before that, some researchers proposed to use genetic algorithm to generate test cases to solve the problem of single test cases. However, the test cases generated by genetic algorithm are often of high randomness, and the proportion of effective test cases is relatively low. According to this problem, I proposed to generate test cases based on generative countermeasure network. On the basis of ensuring its randomness, the relevant test cases are generated pertinently. Through relevant experiments, it is proved that the generated confrontation network can generate effective test cases. Compared with the test cases generated by genetic algorithm, its effectiveness is better and more web vulnerabilities can be found.},

abstract={Our transaction history in the current centralized banking system has the ability to reveal a lot of private information for each spender, both to the banking system itself, but also to those entities that surround it (e.g., governments, industry etc). Examples of leaking information constitute the amounts spent, the goods on which the amounts were spent, the spending locations and the users we exchange money with. This knowledge is powerful in the hands of those who have it, and can be used in multiple ways, not always to our benefit. Cryptocurrencies, such as the famous Bitcoin, were proposed as a means to address the limitations of centralized banking systems and to offer its users privacy with regards to their transactional data. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review on the realm of privacy for electronic currencies. We present the development of digital money from electronic cash to cryptocurrencies and focus on the techniques that are employed to enhance user-privacy. Furthermore, we present flaws of the current cryptocurrency systems, which reduce the privacy of the cryptocurrency users.

In this paper, we contemplated an anomaly detection model which uses machine learning algorithms for data mining within a network to detect anomalies present at any time. This proposed model is evaluated against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks while selecting the most common and evident features of IPv6 and IPv4 networks for optimizing the detection.

abstract={Modern router hardware in computer networks is based on programmable network processors, which implement various packet forwarding operations in software. These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores.

abstract={While the decoupling of control and data planes in software-defined networking (SDN) facilitates orchestrating network traffic, it suffers from security threats. For example, saturation attacks can make SDN out of service by exhausting the controller' and switch's computational resources. The existing research has focused on defense against limited types of saturation attacks. In this paper, we propose vSwitchGuard, a framework for detection and countermeasure of known and unknown saturation attacks in SDN. vSwitchGuard aims to identify the victim switches targeted by known or unknown types of saturation attacks with machine learning classifiers and restore the victim switches to their safe state through deep packet inspection. We have evaluated three supervised classifiers and four semi-supervised classifiers for five types of saturation attacks (TCP-SYN, UDP, ICMP, IP-Spoofing, and TCP-SARFU) and their combinations. The results suggest that supervised and semi-supervised classifiers can be combined to deal with known and unknown attacks for better performance. We have also implemented the countermeasure and evaluated it with all combinations of the five types of attacks. The results demonstrate that vSwitchGuard can effectively defend against the attacks without significant performance overhead.},

abstract={Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will form the backbone of future next-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS) providing travel comfort, road safety, along with a number of value-added services. Such a transformation-which will be fuelled by concomitant advances in technologies for machine learning (ML) and wireless communications-will enable a future vehicular ecosystem that is better featured and more efficient. However, there are lurking security problems related to the use of ML in such a critical setting where an incorrect ML decision may not only be a nuisance but can lead to loss of precious lives. In this paper, we present an in-depth overview of the various challenges associated with the application of ML in vehicular networks. In addition, we formulate the ML pipeline of CAVs and present various potential security issues associated with the adoption of ML methods. In particular, we focus on the perspective of adversarial ML attacks on CAVs and outline a solution to defend against adversarial attacks in multiple settings.},

abstract={Network security applications, including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) of deep neural networks (DNN), are increasing rapidly to make detection task of anomaly activities more accurate and robust. With the rapid increase of using DNN and the volume of data traveling through systems, different growing types of adversarial attacks to defeat DNN create a severe challenge. In this paper, we focus on investigating the effectiveness of different evasion attacks and how to train a resilience deep learning-based IDS using different Neural networks, e.g., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). We use the min-max formulation to formulate the problem of training robust intrusion detection systems against adversarial samples using two benchmark datasets. Our experiments on different deep learning algorithms and different benchmark datasets demonstrate that defense using adversarial training based min-max formulation increases the robustness of the network under the assumption of our threat model and five state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.},

year={2019},
volume={},

pages={1-7},
abstract={Routing protocols, including OSPF, are essential for correct network function and therefore attractive targets for attackers. Many attacks on OSPF are known. Limited progress on detection and prevention has meant that protecting against and recovering from such attacks typically requires significant manual effort. The goal of this research is to make networks more resilient to all known attacks that exploit OSPF Link State Advertisements (LSAs), without requiring modifications to the OSPF protocol. The proposed solution adds a Virtual Routing Resilience Cluster (VRRC) to the network infrastructure. This cluster makes use of three concepts. The first is that new links are added infrequently to networks. By comparing with previous topology information, suspect LSA information can be detected and rejected. The second is that it should be possible to corroborate LSAs by comparing with data made available from other layers of the network. LSAs that conflict with data from other layers can safely be rejected. The third is a rudimentary recovery and adaptation system designed to reestablish network connectivity and prevent the attack from happening again. This can be accomplished by purging the routing table and generating routing policies to block the offending source of the attack. We show that these concepts lead to protection against all known OSPF attacks, and that the concepts are feasible to implement, without resorting to the complexity of key management, and without modifying the routing protocol. The ability of the network to reconfigure around normal routing failures is also not compromised. A VRRC was added to a testbed consisting of standard routers, and shown to provide protection against state of the art attacks. The impact of the implementation on network throughput and router CPU usage is shown.},

abstract={Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) imposes increasing threats on cyber security with the developing network attack technologies. APT is a highly interactive, specifically targeted and extremely harmful network-centric attack, which employs various technologies to evade detection during attacks leading to the result that victims will not be aware of attacks until they suffer from tremendous losses. Since command and control (C&C) is an essential component during the lifetime of APT, the detection of it is a practical measure to defend against the APT. In this paper, we analyze the features of C&C in APT and find that the HTTP-based C&C is widely used. Based on the analysis results, we propose a new feature of C&C, i.e., independent access, to characterize the difference between C&C communications and normal HTTP requests. Applying the independent access feature into DNS records, we implement a novel C&C detection method and validate it on public dataset. As a new feature of C&C, its advantages and drawbacks are also analyzed.},

abstract={Locating the center of the eyes allows for valuable information to be captured and used in a wide range of applications. Accurate eye center location can be determined using commercial eye-gaze trackers, but additional constraints and expensive hardware make these existing solutions unattractive and impossible to use on standard (i.e., visible wavelength), low-resolution images of eyes. Systems based solely on appearance are proposed in the literature, but their accuracy does not allow us to accurately locate and distinguish eye centers movements in these low-resolution settings. Our aim is to bridge this gap by locating the center of the eye within the area of the pupil on low-resolution images taken from a webcam or a similar device. The proposed method makes use of isophote properties to gain invariance to linear lighting changes (contrast and brightness), to achieve in-plane rotational invariance, and to keep low-computational costs. To further gain scale invariance, the approach is applied to a scale space pyramid. In this paper, we extensively test our approach for its robustness to changes in illumination, head pose, scale, occlusion, and eye rotation. We demonstrate that our system can achieve a significant improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques for eye center location in standard low-resolution imagery.},

Post the Mirai-based DDoS attack in 2016 which compromised IoT devices, a host of new malware using Mirai's leaked source code and targeting IoT devices have cropped up, e.g. Satori, Reaper, Amnesia, Masuta etc. These malware exploit software vulnerabilities to infect IoT devices instead of open TELNET ports (like Mirai) making them more difficult to block using existing solutions such as firewalls. In this research, we present EDIMA, a distributed modular solution which can be used towards the detection of IoT malware network activity in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP, enterprise networks) during the scanning/infecting phase rather than during an attack. EDIMA employs machine learning algorithms for edge devices' traffic classification, a packet traffic feature vector database, a policy module and an optional packet sub-sampling module. We evaluate the classification performance of EDIMA through testbed experiments and present the results obtained.},

abstract={Deep Learning (DL) has recently achieved tremendous success. A variety of DL frameworks and platforms play a key role to catalyze such progress. However, the differences in architecture designs and implementations of existing frameworks and platforms bring new challenges for DL software development and deployment. Till now, there is no study on how various mainstream frameworks and platforms influence both DL software development and deployment in practice. To fill this gap, we take the first step towards understanding how the most widely-used DL frameworks and platforms support the DL software development and deployment. We conduct a systematic study on these frameworks and platforms by using two types of DNN architectures and three popular datasets. (1) For development process, we investigate the prediction accuracy under the same runtime training configuration or same model weights/biases. We also study the adversarial robustness of trained models by leveraging the existing adversarial attack techniques. The experimental results show that the computing differences across frameworks could result in an obvious prediction accuracy decline, which should draw the attention of DL developers. (2) For deployment process, we investigate the prediction accuracy and performance (refers to time cost and memory consumption) when the trained models are migrated/quantized from PC to real mobile devices and web browsers. The DL platform study unveils that the migration and quantization still suffer from compatibility and reliability issues. Meanwhile, we find several DL software bugs by using the results as a benchmark. We further validate the results through bug confirmation from stakeholders and industrial positive feedback to highlight the implications of our study. Through our study, we summarize practical guidelines, identify challenges and pinpoint new research directions, such as understanding the characteristics of DL frameworks and platforms, avoiding compatibility and reliability issues, detecting DL software bugs, and reducing time cost and memory consumption towards developing and deploying high quality DL systems effectively.},

We conclude that a weighted network analysis can give a better vulnerability assessment than that of an unweighted network.},

abstract={Collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) shares the critical detection-control information across the nodes for improved and coordinated defense. Software-defined network (SDN) introduces the controllers for the networking control, including for the networks spanning across multiple autonomous systems, and therefore provides a prime platform for CIDS application. Although previous research studies have focused on CIDS in SDN, the real-time secure exchange of the detection-relevant information (e.g., the detection signature) remains a critical challenge. In particular, the CIDS research still lacks robust trust management of the SDN controllers and the integrity protection of the collaborative defense information to resist against the insider attacks transmitting untruthful and malicious detection signatures to other participating controllers. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative intrusion detection in SDN, taking advantage of the blockchain's security properties. Our scheme achieves three important security goals: to establish the trust of the participating controllers by using the permissioned blockchain to register the controller and manage digital certificates, to protect the integrity of the detection signatures against malicious detection signature injection, and to attest the delivery/update of the detection signature to other controllers. Our experiments in CloudLab based on a prototype built on Ethereum, Smart Contract, and IPFS demonstrates that our approach efficiently shares and distributes detection signatures in real-time through the trustworthy distributed platform.},

abstract={The presence of uncertain parameters in design of microgrids (MG) adds significant challenges for MGs planner when it comes to making decisions. To address the uncertainties in the technical and pecuniary information especially in the case of lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty, this paper proposes a novel robust optimization approach for optimum design of MGs considering reconfigurable topology. The proposed approach investigates the economic and reliable structure for MGs deployment and optimal planning of distributed energy resources with section switch and tie switch (TSW) allocation to determine MGs boundaries and topologies. The optimal TSW allocation is implemented in order to change the configuration of distribution network to increase robustness of MGs versus uncertainty. The profit-based objective function is converted into robust framework and, subsequently, has been transformed into single level model by duality gap theory. Finally, grey wolf optimization algorithm has been carried out to solve the proposed model. The appraisement of the proposed model is accomplished by applying it on the IEEE 30-bus distribution system and results of case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Under specific circumstances, it may be necessary to create a selective untargeted adversarial example that will not be classified as certain avoided classes. Such is the case, for example, if a modified tank cover can cause misclassification by a DNN, but the bandit equipped with the DNN must misclassify the modified tank as a class other than certain avoided classes, such as a tank, armored vehicle, or self-propelled gun. That is, selective untargeted adversarial examples are needed that will not be perceived as certain classes, such as tanks, armored vehicles, or self-propelled guns. In this study, we propose a selective untargeted adversarial example that exhibits 100% attack success with minimum distortions. The proposed scheme creates a selective untargeted adversarial example that will not be classified as certain avoided classes while minimizing distortions in the original sample. To generate untargeted adversarial examples, a transformation is performed to minimize the probability of certain avoided classes and distortions in the original sample. As experimental datasets, we used MNIST and CIFAR-10, including the Tensorflow library. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme creates a selective untargeted adversarial example that exhibits 100% attack success with minimum distortions (1.325 and 34.762 for MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively).},

abstract={We propose Cleann, the first end-to-end framework that enables online mitigation of Trojans for embedded Deep Neural Network (DNN) applications. A Trojan attack works by injecting a backdoor in the DNN while training; during inference, the Trojan can be activated by the specific backdoor trigger. What differentiates Cleann from the prior work is its lightweight methodology which recovers the ground-truth class of Trojan samples without the need for labeled data, model retraining, or prior assumptions on the trigger or the attack. We leverage dictionary learning and sparse approximation to characterize the statistical behavior of benign data and identify Trojan triggers. Cleann is devised based on algorithm/hardware co-design and is equipped with specialized hardware to enable efficient real-time execution on resource-constrained embedded platforms. Proof of concept evaluations on Cleann for the state-of-the-art Neural Trojan attacks on visual benchmarks demonstrate its competitive advantage in terms of attack resiliency and execution overhead.},

Multi-biometrics are mandatory in the current context of large international biometric databases and to accommodate new emerging security demands. Our paper is a comprehensive survey on multi-biometrics, covering two important topics related to the multi-biometric field: fusion methods and security. Fusion is a core requirement in multi-biometric systems, being the method used to combine multiple biometric methods into a single system. The fusion section surveys recent multi-biometric schemes categorized from the perspective of fusion method. The security section is a comprehensive review of current issues, such as sensor spoofing, template security, and biometric encryption. New research trends and open challenges are discussed, such as soft, adaptive contextual-based biometrics. Finally, an implementation blueprint for a multi-biometric system is presented in the form of a list of questions to be answered when designing the system.},

abstract={We develop a new method for defending deep neural networks against attacks using adversarial dual network learning with randomized nonlinear image transform. We introduce a randomized nonlinear transform to disturb and partially destroy the sophisticated pattern of attack noise. We then design a generative cleaning network to recover the original image content damaged by this nonlinear transform and remove residual attack noise. We also construct a detector network which serves as the dual network for the target classifier to be defended, being able to detect patterns of attack noise. The generative cleaning network and detector network are jointly trained using adversarial learning, fighting against each other to minimize both perceptual loss and adversarial loss. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the state-of-art by large margins in both white-box and black-box attacks. It significantly improves the classification accuracy for white-box attacks upon the second best method by more than 30% on the SVHN dataset and more than 14% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset.},

abstract={Recognizing activities in wide aerial/overhead imagery remains a challenging problem due in part to low-resolution video and cluttered scenes with a large number of moving objects. In the context of this research, we deal with two un-synchronized data sources collected in real-world operating scenarios: full-motion videos (FMV) and analyst call-outs (ACO) in the form of chat messages (voice-to-text) made by a human watching the streamed FMV from an aerial platform. We present a multi-source multi-modal activity/event recognition system for surveillance applications, consisting of: (1) detecting and tracking multiple dynamic targets from a moving platform, (2) representing FMV target tracks and chat messages as graphs of attributes, (3) associating FMV tracks and chat messages using a probabilistic graph-based matching approach, and (4) detecting spatial-temporal activity boundaries. We also present an activity pattern learning framework which uses the multi-source associated data as training to index a large archive of FMV videos. Finally, we describe a multi-intelligence user interface for querying an index of activities of interest (AOIs) by movement type and geo-location, and for playing-back a summary of associated text (ACO) and activity video segments of targets-of-interest (TOIs) (in both pixel and geo-coordinates). Such tools help the end-user to quickly search, browse, and prepare mission reports from multi-source data.},

abstract={Insider threat detection has drawn increasing attention in recent years. In order to capture a malicious insider's digital footprints that occur scatteredly across a wide range of audit data sources over a long period of time, existing approaches often leverage a scoring mechanism to orchestrate alerts generated from multiple sub-detectors, or require domain knowledge-based feature engineering to conduct a one-off analysis across multiple types of data. These approaches result in a high deployment complexity and incur additional costs for engaging security experts. In this paper, we present a novel approach that works with a variety of security logs. The security logs are transformed into texts in the same format and then arranged as a corpus. Using the model trained by Word2vec with the corpus, we are enabled to approximate the posterior probabilities for insider behaviours. Accordingly, we label the transformed events as suspicious if their behavioural probabilities are smaller than a given threshold, and a user is labelled as malicious if he/she is associated with multiple suspicious events. The experiments are undertaken with the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) CERT Programs insider threat database v6.2, which not only demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and scalable in practical applications but also provide a guidance for tuning the parameters and thresholds.},

While the accuracy of phishing detection reported in the papers is impressive, the damage from the attacks continues to grow every year. One of the reasons is the diversity of attacks, especially within spear phishing and whaling. Another reason is that the natural language part of the detectors is usually devoid of semantics. In this paper we present an approach that adds semantics to highly accurate bag of words and part of speech approaches. We show that while the current approach is less accurate as a starting point, it retains its accuracy as a corpus deviates from training, while the accuracy of the original approach decreases with the amount of deviations.},

abstract={In studies of emotion estimation from text, varieties of methods have been attempted such as emotional expression dictionary or sentence structure dictionary and emotion corpus. However, most of these methods targeted the expressions included in the existing morphological analysis dictionaries, as a result, they did not pay enough attention to unknown words, especially newly coined words. In Japan, the growth of Internet communication sites such as weblogs and social networking sites brought younger people especially in teens and in their 20s to create new words and use them very often. We prepared an emotion corpus by collecting weblog article texts including new words, analyzed the corpus statistically, and proposed a method to estimate emotions of the texts. Most slang such as Youth Slang is too ambiguous in sense classification to be registered into the existing dictionaries such as thesaurus. To cope with these words, we created a large scale of Twitter corpus to calculate sense similarity between words. We proposed to convert unknown to sense class id to process the words that were not included in learning data. We defined this as a method using Bag of Concepts as feature. As a result of the evaluation experiment using several classifies, the proposed method was proved robustness for unknown expression.},

abstract={Deep learning classifiers are now known to have flaws in the representations of their class. Adversarial attacks can find a human-imperceptible perturbation for a given image that will mislead a trained model. The most effective methods to defend against such attacks trains on generated adversarial examples to learn their distribution. Previous work aimed to align original and adversarial image representations in the same way as domain adaptation to improve robustness. Yet, they partially align the representations using approaches that do not reflect the geometry of space and distribution. In addition, it is difficult to accurately compare robustness between defended models. Until now, they have been evaluated using a fixed perturbation size. However, defended models may react differently to variations of this perturbation size. In this paper, the analogy of domain adaptation is taken a step further by exploiting optimal transport theory. We propose to use a loss between distributions that faithfully reflect the ground distance. This leads to SAT (Sinkhorn Adversarial Training), a more robust defense against adversarial attacks. Then, we propose to quantify more precisely the robustness of a model to adversarial attacks over a wide range of perturbation sizes using a different metric, the Area Under the Accuracy Curve (AUAC). We perform extensive experiments on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and show that our defense is globally more robust than the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={Learning movement primitive from unstructured demonstrations has become a popular topic in recent years, which provides a natural way to endow human-inspired skills to robots. The main idea of movement primitives is that should suffice to reconstruct a large set of complex manipulation tasks. However, conventional learning methods mostly focus on the kinesthetic variables and ignore those critical introspective capacities in manipulation such as movement generalization and assessment of the sensory signals. In this paper, we investigate the association of generalization, fault detection, fault diagnoses, and task exploration during manipulation task, and call such movement primitives augmented with introspective capacities Introspective Movement Primitives (IMP). With our previous work, this paper mainly addresses how IMPs can be acquired by assessing the quality of multimodal sensory data of unstructured demonstrations and how they can incrementally create manipulation task by reverse execution and human interaction. Experimental evaluation on a human-robot collaborative packaging task with a Rethink Baxter robot, results indicate that our proposed method can effectively increase robustness towards external perturbations and adaptive exploration during robot manipulation task.},

abstract={Performance of OFDM is known to be very sensitive to frequency synchronization errors. By exploiting this feature, a novel technique is proposed to provide secure communication against eavesdropping. The technique is based on introducing self inter-carrier interference to pre-compensate the carrier offset only for the legitimate user. This pre-compensation process depends on both the channel and the local carrier offset of the legitimate user, hence provides another degree of freedom for secrecy. Since an eavesdropper experiences an uncorrelated channel, his performance is expected to be degraded. Also our approach converts the simple one-tap frequency domain channel equalization to a very complex receiver operation for the eavesdropper. Moreover, the power aspects of this technique are discussed. By setting a threshold in the pre-compensation stage, we provide an acceptable trade-off between the transmitted power and the error performance.},

abstract={Due to the extensive code reuse and the widespread use of third-party SDKs, homologous binaries are widely found in IoT firmwares. Once a vulnerability is found in one firmware, other firmwares sharing the similar piece of codes are at high risk. Thus, homologous binary search is of great significance to IoT firmware security analysis. However, there are still no scalable and efficient homologous binary search methods for IoT firmwares. The time complexity of the state-of-the-art method is O(N), and it is not scalable for large-scale IoT firmwares. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a scalable and efficient homologous binary search scheme (termed as IHB) for IoT firmwares with time complexity O(1). The main idea of our methodology is to leverage readable strings in binaries to calculate the similarities between different IoT firmwares. Furthermore, we employ a string filter and the string-based MinHash to achieve both accuracy and efficiency. We test both our scheme and the state-of-the-art methods on a real dataset containing 1024 binary files. The results show that our method is three orders of magnitude more efficient than the existing methods. Meanwhile, our method has a higher true positive rate (92.88%) and a lower false positive rate (2.83%). In the interest of open science, we also make our tools and datasets publicly available to seed future improvements.},

Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. Hence, the security of IoT should start with foremost securing WSNs ahead of the other components. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e., there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. More specifically, for the application areas in which CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) has prime importance, WSNs and emerging IoT technology might constitute an open avenue for the attackers. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: “Passive Attacks” and “Active Attacks”. Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help paving a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.},

abstract={Many techniques were proposed for detecting software misconfigurations in cloud systems and for diagnosing unintended behavior caused by such misconfigurations. Detection and diagnosis are steps in the right direction: misconfigurations cause many costly failures and severe performance issues. But, we argue that continued focus on detection and diagnosis is symptomatic of a more serious problem: configuration design and implementation are not yet first-class software engineering endeavors in cloud systems. Little is known about how and why developers evolve configuration design and implementation, and the challenges that they face in doing so. This paper presents a source-code level study of the evolution of configuration design and implementation in cloud systems. Our goal is to understand the rationale and developer practices for revising initial configuration design/implementation decisions, especially in response to consequences of misconfigurations. To this end, we studied 1178 configuration-related commits from a 2.5 year version-control history of four large-scale, actively-maintained open-source cloud systems (HDFS, HBase, Spark, and Cassandra). We derive new insights into the software configuration engineering process. Our results motivate new techniques for proactively reducing misconfigurations by improving the configuration design and implementation process in cloud systems. We highlight a number of future research directions.},

abstract={The limited information on the cyberattacks available in the unclassified regime, hardens standardizing the analysis. We address the problem of modeling and analyzing cyberattacks using a multimodal graph approach. We formulate the stages, actors, and outcomes of cyberattacks as a multimodal graph. Multimodal graph nodes include cyberattack victims, adversaries, autonomous systems, and the observed cyber events. In multimodal graphs, single-modality graphs are interconnected according to their interaction. We apply community and centrality analysis on the graph to obtain in-depth insights into the attack. In community analysis, we cluster those nodes that exhibit “strong” inter-modal ties. We further use centrality to rank the nodes according to their importance. Classifying nodes according to centrality provides the progression of the attack from the attacker to the targeted nodes. We apply our methods to two popular case studies, namely GhostNet and Putter Panda and demonstrate a clear distinction in the attack stages.},

While a lot of efforts have been dedicated to deal with such threats from the hardware, the software, and the applications, in this paper, we argue and envision that more effective and comprehensive protection for IoT systems can only be achieved via a cross-layer approach. As such, we present our initial design of XLF, a cross-layer framework towards this goal.

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to maliciously generated adversarial examples. These examples are intentionally designed by making imperceptible perturbations and often mislead a DNN into making an incorrect prediction. This phenomenon means that there is significant risk in applying DNNs to safety-critical applications, such as driverless cars. To address this issue, we present a visual analytics approach to explain the primary cause of the wrong predictions introduced by adversarial examples. The key is to analyze the datapaths of the adversarial examples and compare them with those of the normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons and their connections. To this end, we formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and approximately solve it based on back-propagation. A multi-level visualization consisting of a segmented DAG (layer level), an Euler diagram (feature map level), and a heat map (neuron level), has been designed to help experts investigate datapaths from the high-level layers to the detailed neuron activations. Two case studies are conducted that demonstrate the promise of our approach in support of explaining the working mechanism of adversarial examples.},

abstract={The recent boost in undersea operations has led to the development of high-resolution sonar systems mounted on autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are used to scan the seafloor in search of different objects such as sunken ships, archaeological sites, and submerged mines. An important part of the detection operation is the segmentation of sonar images, where the object's highlight and shadow are distinguished from the seabed background. In this paper, we focus on the automatic segmentation of sonar images. We present our enhanced fuzzy-based with Kernel metric (EnFK) algorithm for the segmentation of sonar images which, in an attempt to improve segmentation accuracy, introduces two new fuzzy terms of local spatial and statistical information. Our algorithm includes a preliminary de-noising algorithm which, together with the original image, feeds into the segmentation procedure to avoid trapping to local minima and to improve convergence. The result is a segmentation procedure that specifically suits the intensity inhomogeneity and the complex seabed texture of sonar images. We tested our approach using simulated images, real sonar images, and sonar images that were created in two different sea experiments, using multibeam sonar and synthetic aperture sonar. The results show accurate segmentation performance that is far beyond the state-of-the-art results.},

abstract={In public communication networks such as the internet, users can easily share and access multimedia products such as images, videos, and audios. Copyright protection is a vital issue to prove the ownership of products in these networks. Consequently, digital watermarking that hide invisible watermark or logo plays a significant role in overcoming copyright issue. However, any person has access to multimedia products can simply use these products. Also, there are professional attackers can remove the watermark or logo without loss the visibility of the multimedia product and claim their ownership for the digital products. This study proposes an image watermarking model that only allows authorized users to use the watermarked image. This model is robust against crop and rotation attacks. It is based on the proposed embedding method that we named a "concentric rectangles", which embeds data in rectangles starting from the center toward outer boundary to overcome the crop and rotation attacks. The resulted watermarked image is distorted in such a way to be recognized by any user, but only the authorized one can obtain a high quality of the watermarked image. The experimental results of the proposed model show that the embedding capacity can reach up to 25% from the size of the host image with watermarked image quality above 40 dB in terms of peak signal to noise rotation (PSNR). Furthermore, the proposed model is fully retrieval for the watermark image (logo) and the logo still retrieved a with a recognized vision until 10 dB of signal to noise ratio of noise adding.},

abstract={Indoor localization has recently witnessed an increase in interest, due to the potential wide range of services it can provide by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT), and ubiquitous connectivity. Different techniques, wireless technologies and mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide indoor localization services in order to improve the services provided to the users. However, there is a lack of an up-to-date survey paper that incorporates some of the recently proposed accurate and reliable localization systems. In this paper, we aim to provide a detailed survey of different indoor localization techniques, such as angle of arrival (AoA), time of flight (ToF), return time of flight (RTOF), and received signal strength (RSS); based on technologies, such as WiFi, radio frequency identification device (RFID), ultra wideband (UWB), Bluetooth, and systems that have been proposed in the literature. This paper primarily discusses localization and positioning of human users and their devices. We highlight the strengths of the existing systems proposed in the literature. In contrast with the existing surveys, we also evaluate different systems from the perspective of energy efficiency, availability, cost, reception range, latency, scalability, and tracking accuracy. Rather than comparing the technologies or techniques, we compare the localization systems and summarize their working principle. We also discuss remaining challenges to accurate indoor localization.},

number={},
pages={2709-2723},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel defensive transformation that enables us to maintain a high classification accuracy under the use of both clean images and adversarial examples for adversarially robust defense. The proposed transformation is a block-wise preprocessing technique with a secret key to input images. The proposed defense obfuscates gradients in the absence of the secret key unlike previously defeated obfuscating defenses. We developed three algorithms to realize the proposed transformation: Pixel Shuffling, Bit Flipping, and FFX Encryption. Experiments were carried out on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets by using both black-box and white-box attacks with various metrics including adaptive ones. The results show that the proposed defense achieves high accuracy close to that of using clean images even under adaptive attacks for the first time. In the best-case scenario, a model trained by using images transformed by FFX Encryption (block size of 4) yielded an accuracy of 92.30% on clean images and 91.48% under PGD attack with a noise distance of 8/255, which is close to the non-robust accuracy (95.45%) for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and it yielded an accuracy of 72.18% on clean images and 71.43% under the same attack, which is also close to the standard accuracy (73.70%) for the ImageNet dataset. Overall, all three proposed algorithms are demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art defenses including adversarial training whether or not a model is under attack.},

pages={485-499},
abstract={Due to the concern on cloud security, digital encryption is applied before outsourcing data to the cloud for utilization. This introduces a challenge about how to efficiently perform queries over ciphertexts. Crypto-based solutions currently suffer from limited operation support, high computational complexity, weak generality, and poor verifiability. An alternative method that utilizes hardware-assisted Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), i.e., Intel SGX, has emerged to offer high computational efficiency, generality and flexibility. However, SGX-based solutions lack support on multi-user query control and suffer from security compromises caused by untrustworthy TEE function invocation, e.g., key revocation failure, incorrect query results, and sensitive information leakage. In this article, we leverage SGX and propose a secure and efficient SQL-style query framework named QShield. Notably, we propose a novel lightweight secret sharing scheme in QShield to enable multi-user query control; it effectively circumvents key revocation and avoids cumbersome remote attestation for authentication. We further embed a trust-proof mechanism into QShield to guarantee the trustworthiness of TEE function invocation; it ensures the correctness of query results and alleviates side-channel attacks. Through formal security analysis, proof-of-concept implementation and performance evaluation, we show that QShield can securely query over outsourced data with high efficiency and scalable multi-user support.},

abstract={Location-aware smart phones support various location-based services (LBSs): users query the LBS server and learn on the fly about their surroundings. However, such queries give away private information, enabling the LBS to identify and track users. We address this problem by proposing the first, to the best of our knowledge, user-collaborative privacy preserving approach for LBSs. Our solution, MobiCrowd, is simple to implement, it does not require changing the LBS server architecture, and it does not assume third party privacy-protection servers; still, MobiCrowd significantly improves user location-privacy. The gain stems from the collaboration of MobiCrowd-ready mobile devices: they keep their context information in a buffer, until it expires, and they pass it to other users seeking such information. Essentially, the LBS does not need to be contacted unless all the collaborative peers in the vicinity lack the sought information. Hence, the user can remain hidden from the server, unless it absolutely needs to expose herself through a query. Our results show that MobiCrowd hides a high fraction of location-based queries, thus significantly enhancing user location-privacy. To study the effects of various parameters, such as the collaboration level and contact rate between mobile users, we develop an epidemic model. Our simulations with real mobility datasets corroborate our model-based findings. Finally, our implementation of MobiCrowd on Nokia platforms indicates that it is lightweight and the collaboration cost is negligible.},

This attack is not only a theoretical one, but it has been spotted "in the wild", and even performed by researchers themselves to demonstrate its feasibility.

In particular, we propose a simple, yet complete model that provides the number of random node-IDs that an attacker would need to generate in order to succeed with certain probability. Therefore, our model enables to quantify the cost of performing a Sybil resource attack on RELOAD/Chord DHTs more accurately than previous works, and thus establishes the basis to measure the effectiveness of different solutions proposed in the literature to prevent or mitigate Sybil attacks.},

abstract={Deep learning is at the heart of the current rise of artificial intelligence. In the field of computer vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images, such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models. Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks, analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial attacks in the real-world scenarios. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide a broader outlook of this research direction.},

The major contribution to the high computational speed lies in the proposed deep feature compression that is achieved by a context-aware scheme utilizing multiple expert auto-encoders; a context in our framework refers to the coarse category of the tracking target according to appearance patterns. In the pre-training phase, one expert auto-encoder is trained per category. In the tracking phase, the best expert auto-encoder is selected for a given target, and only this auto-encoder is used. To achieve high tracking performance with the compressed feature map, we introduce extrinsic denoising processes and a new orthogonality loss term for pre-training and fine-tuning of the expert autoencoders. We validate the proposed context-aware framework through a number of experiments, where our method achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art trackers which cannot run in real-time, while running at a significantly fast speed of over 100 fps.},

volume={},

pages={313-328},
abstract={Security is a major barrier to enterprise adoption of cloud computing. Physical co-residency with other tenants poses a particular risk, due to pervasive virtualization in the cloud. Recent research has shown how side channels in shared hardware may enable attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data across virtual machines (VMs). In view of such risks, cloud providers may promise physically isolated resources to select tenants, but a challenge remains: Tenants still need to be able to verify physical isolation of their VMs. We introduce Home Alone, a system that lets a tenant verify its VMs' exclusive use of a physical machine. The key idea in Home Alone is to invert the usual application of side channels. Rather than exploiting a side channel as a vector of attack, Home Alone uses a side-channel (in the L2 memory cache) as a novel, defensive detection tool. By analyzing cache usage during periods in which "friendly" VMs coordinate to avoid portions of the cache, a tenant using Home Alone can detect the activity of a co-resident "foe" VM. Key technical contributions of Home Alone include classification techniques to analyze cache usage and guest operating system kernel modifications that minimize the performance impact of friendly VMs sidestepping monitored cache portions. Home Alone requires no modification of existing hyper visors and no special action or cooperation by the cloud provider.},

abstract={The growing popularity of Android-based smart-phones have led to the rise of Android based malware. In particular, profit-motivated malware is becoming increasingly popular in Android malware distribution. These malware typically profit by sending premium-rate SMS messages and/or make premium-rate phone calls from infected devices without user consent. In this paper, we investigate the telephony framework of the Android operating system and propose a novel process user-identification (UID) based online detection scheme. Our scheme can effectively detect premium-rate and background SMS messages as well as premium-rate phone calls initiated by malware. We implemented our detection system on a Samsung Google Nexus 4 running Android Jelly Bean and tested the effectiveness of detecting real malware from Android markets. The experimental results show that our scheme is efficient and effective in detecting background messages and premium-rate messages and phone calls. Our scheme can detect and block all the background and premium-rate SMS messages and phone calls initiated by popular malware.},

abstract={Cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) is a serious vulnerability in Web 2.0 environment. With CSRF, an adversary can spoof the payload of an HTTP request and entice the victim's browser to transmit an HTTP request to the web server. Consequently, the server cannot determine legitimacy of the HTTP request. This paper presents a light-weight CSRF prevention method by introducing a quarantine system to inspect suspicious scripts on the server-side. Instead of using script filtering and rewriting approach, this scheme is based on a new labeling mechanism (we called it Content Box) which enables the web server to distinguish the malicious requests from the harmless requests without the need to modify the user created contents (UCCs). Consequently, a malicious request can be blocked when it attempts to access critical web services that was defined by the web administrator. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the proposed scheme was implemented and the performance was evaluated.},

abstract={In modern internet-scale computing, interaction between a large number of parties that are not known a-priori is predominant, with each party functioning both as a provider and consumer of services and information. In such an environment, traditional access control mechanisms face considerable limitations, since granting appropriate authorizations to each distinct party is infeasible both due to the high number of grantees and the dynamic nature of interactions. Trust management has emerged as a solution to this issue, offering aids towards the automated verification of actions against security policies. In this paper, we present a trust- and risk-based approach to security, which considers status, behavior and associated risk aspects in the trust computation process, while additionally it captures user-to-user trust relationships which are propagated to the device level, through user-to-device ownership links.},

abstract={Two "heterogeneous" information dissemination networks were established on the basis of sets of actual "rum or information" and "anti-rum or information" dissemination data involving a real micro logging event. Through empirical analysis of degree centrality, between ness centrality and closeness centrality, it was discovered that all three centrality indexes of the two networks follow an approximate power-law distribution, which means that the networks contain key nodes with significant centrality. The above three centrality indexes were used to identify three kinds of key figures, respectively, Leader, Controller and Spreader. Finally, the robustness of the two networks was tested through targeted attack. The robustness of the rum or information network turned out to be significantly greater than that of the anti-rum or information network, and both networks demonstrated high vulnerability when faced with a targeted attack against the Leader.},

abstract={Inference of unknown opinions with uncertain, adversarial (e.g., incorrect or conflicting) evidence in large datasets is not a trivial task. Without proper handling, it can easily mislead decision making in data mining tasks. In this work, we propose a highly scalable opinion inference probabilistic model, namely Adversarial Collective Opinion Inference (Adv-COI), which provides a solution to infer unknown opinions with high scalability and robustness under the presence of uncertain, adversarial evidence by enhancing Collective Subjective Logic (CSL) which is developed by combining SL and Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL). The key idea behind the Adv-COI is to learn a model of robust ways against uncertain, adversarial evidence which is formulated as a min-max problem. We validate the out-performance of the Adv-COI compared to baseline models and its competitive counterparts under possible adversarial attacks on the logic-rule based structured data and white and black box adversarial attacks under both clean and perturbed semi-synthetic and real-world datasets in three real world applications. The results show that the Adv-COI generates the lowest mean absolute error in the expected truth probability while producing the lowest running time among all.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly emerging field of technologies that delivers numerous cutting-edge solutions in various domains including the critical infrastructures. Thanks to the IoT, the conventional power system network can be transformed into an effective and smarter energy grid. In this article, we review the architecture and functionalities of IoT-enabled smart energy grid systems. Specifically, we focus on different IoT technologies including sensing, communication, computing technologies, and their standards in relation to smart energy grid. This article also presents a comprehensive overview of existing studies on IoT applications to the smart grid system. Based on recent surveys and literature, we observe that the security vulnerabilities related to IoT technologies have been attributed as one of the major concerns of IoT-enabled energy systems. Therefore, we review the existing threat and attack models for IoT-enabled energy systems and summarize mitigation techniques for those security vulnerabilities. Finally, we highlight how advanced technologies (e.g., blockchain, machine learning, and artificial intelligence) can complement IoT-enabled energy systems to be more resilient and secure and overcome the existing difficulties so that they become more effective, robust, and reliable in operation.

abstract={Finding adequate responses to ongoing attacks on ICT systems is a pertinacious problem and requires assessments from different perpendicular viewpoints. However, current research focuses on reducing the impact of an attack irregardless of side-effects caused by responses. In order to achieve a comprehensive yet accurate response to possible and ongoing attacks on a managed ICT system, we propose an approach that relies on a response system that continuously quantifies risks, and decides how to respond to cyber-threats that target a monitored ICT system. Our Dynamic Risk Management Response (DRMR) model is composed of two main modules: a Response Financial Impact Assessor (RFIA), which provides an assessment concerning the potential financial impact that responses may cause to an organization, and a Response Operational Impact Assessor (ROIA), which assesses potential impacts that efficient mitigation actions may cause on the organization in an operational perspective. As a result, the DRMR model proposes response plans to mitigate identified risks, enable choice of the most suitable response possibilities to reduce identified risks below an admissible level while minimizing potential negative side effects of deliberately taken actions.},

abstract={The mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a new wireless technology, having features like dynamic topology and self-configuring ability of nodes. The self configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among the critical situation such as military use and emergency recovery. But due to open medium and broad distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to different attacks. So to protect MANET from various attacks, it is important to develop an efficient and secure system for MANET. Intrusion means any set of actions that attempt to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a resource. Intrusion Prevention is the primary defense because it is the first step to make the systems secure from attacks by using passwords, biometrics etc. Even if intrusion prevention methods are used, the system may be subjected to some vulnerability. So we need a second wall of defense known as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), to detect and produce responses whenever necessary. In this article we present a survey of various intrusion detection schemes available for ad hoc networks. We have also described some of the basic attacks present in ad hoc network and discussed their available solution.},

year={2021},
volume={40},
number={1},
pages={11-23},
abstract={Oracle guided attacks, such as the satisfiability attack, are a significant concern when obfuscating an integrated circuit (IC). Partitioned finite state machine (FSM) based sequential logic locking techniques are much more resilient to oracle guided attacks due to the differences in the state space between the oracle and the IC under attack. However, susceptibility to structural attacks and the extraction of the transition state between the obfuscated and functional modes of an FSM threaten the efficacy of sequential logic locking. Therefore, a methodology to synthesize hidden state transitions (HSTs) into an FSM within an IC is developed. HSTs and logic cone modifications are utilized to further enhance the security of sequentially locked circuits by increasing the number of paths an adversary must search and reducing the susceptibility to structural attacks. An algorithm to insert hidden transitions and logic cone modifications into a netlist is developed that results in an average overhead of 6.79% in area, 7.78% in power, and 8.28% in performance across all of the ISCAS'89 sequential benchmark circuits. To modify the logic cone with two altered minterms, the average increase in area and power, beyond what is needed for the implementation of HSTs, is 26.46% and 30.30%, respectively, with no additional overhead in performance.},

abstract={Nowadays, machine learning (ML), which is one of the most rapidly growing technical tools, is extensively used to solve critical challenges in various domains. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is expected to be the key role player in reducing road casualties and traffic congestion. To ensure this role, a gigantic amount of data should be exchanged. However, current allocated wireless access for VANET is inadequate to handle such massive data amounts. Therefore, VANET faces a spectrum scarcity issue. Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising solution to overcome such an issue. CR-based VANET or CR-VANET must achieve several performance enhancement measures, including ultra-reliable and low-latency communication. ML methods can be integrated with CR-VANET to make CR-VANET highly intelligent, achieve rapid adaptability to the dynamicity of the environment, and improve the quality of service in an energy-efficient manner. This paper presents an overview of ML, CR, VANET, and CR-VANET, including their architectures, functions, challenges, and open issues. The applications and roles of ML methods in CR-VANET scenarios are reviewed. Insights into the use of ML for autonomous or driver-less vehicles are also presented. Current advancements in the amalgamation of these prominent technologies and future research directions are discussed.},

abstract={Driven by privacy concerns and the visions of deep learning, the last four years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the applicability mechanism of machine learning (ML). An emerging model, called federated learning (FL), is rising above both centralized systems and on-site analysis, to be a new fashioned design for ML implementation. It is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach, which keeps raw data on devices and involves local ML training while eliminating data communication overhead. A federation of the learned and shared models is then performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants. This article starts by examining and comparing different ML-based deployment architectures, followed by in-depth and in-breadth investigation on FL. Compared to the existing reviews in the field, we provide in this survey a new classification of FL topics and research fields based on thorough analysis of the main technical challenges and current related work. In this context, we elaborate comprehensive taxonomies covering various challenging aspects, contributions, and trends in the literature, including core system models and designs, application areas, privacy and security, and resource management. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges and open research directions toward more robust FL systems.},

abstract={The vision of next generation 5G wireless communications lies in providing very high data rates (typically of Gbps order), extremely low latency, manifold increase in base station capacity, and significant improvement in users' perceived quality of service (QoS), compared to current 4G LTE networks. Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency, and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks' problems. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency. As understanding the current status of 5G implementation is important for its eventual commercialization, we also discuss relevant field trials, drive tests, and simulation experiments. Finally, we point out major existing research issues and identify possible future research directions.},

abstract={Although Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being pervasively used in vision-based autonomous driving systems, they are found vulnerable to adversarial attacks where small-magnitude perturbations into the inputs during test time cause dramatic changes to the outputs. While most of the recent attack methods target at digital-world adversarial scenarios, it is unclear how they perform in the physical world, and more importantly, the generated perturbations under such methods would cover a whole driving scene including those fixed background imagery such as the sky, making them inapplicable to physical world implementation. We present PhysGAN, which generates physical-world-resilient adversarial examples for misleading autonomous driving systems in a continuous manner. We show the effectiveness and robustness of PhysGAN via extensive digital- and real-world evaluations. We compare PhysGAN with a set of state-of-the-art baseline methods, which further demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of our approach. We also show that PhysGAN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, PhysGAN is probably the first technique of generating realistic and physical-world-resilient adversarial examples for attacking common autonomous driving scenarios.},

abstract={Ethereum's Gas mechanism attempts to set transaction fees in accordance with the computational cost of transaction execution: a cost borne by default by every node on the network to ensure correct smart contract execution. Gas encourages users to author transactions that are efficient to execute and in so doing encourages node diversity, allowing modestly resourced nodes to join and contribute to the security of the network. However, the effectiveness of this scheme relies on Gas costs being correctly aligned with observed computational costs in reality. In this work, we performed the first large scale empirical study to understand to what degree this alignment exists in practice, by collecting and analyzing Tera-bytes worth of nanosecond-precision transaction execution traces. Besides confirming potential denial-of-service vectors, our results also shed light on the role of I/O in transaction costs which remains poorly captured by the current Gas cost model. Finally, our results suggest that under the current Gas cost model, nodes with modest computational resources are disadvantaged compared to their better resourced peers, which we identify as an ongoing threat to node diversity and network decentralization.},

abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to being deceived by adversarial examples generated by adding small, human-imperceptible perturbations to a clean image. In this paper, we propose an image reconstruction network that reconstructs an input adversarial example into a clean output image to defend against such adversarial attacks. Due to the powerful learning capabilities of the residual block structure, our model can learn a precise mapping from adversarial examples to reconstructed examples. The use of a perceptual loss greatly suppresses the error amplification effect and improves the performance of our reconstruction network. In addition, by adding randomization layers to the end of the network, the effects of additional noise are further suppressed, especially for iterative attacks. Our model has the following four advantages. 1) It greatly reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations while having little influence on the prediction performance of clean images. 2) During inference phase, it performs better than most existing model-agnostic defense methods. 3) It has better generalization capability. 4) It can be flexibly combined with other methods, such as adversarially trained models.},

To reflect a GNSS signal propagation environment, parameters of a state estimation filter need to be adjusted on-the-fly. A mixed H2/ H∞ filter has been considered here to address the vulnerability of a minimum error variance estimator to measurement outliers. An emphasis between the H2 filter and the H∞ filter (minimizing the worst-case error) is continuously adjusted by a reinforcement learning (RL) model. Specifically, a continuous action actor-critic RL model with eligibility traces is implemented. The Cramér-Rao lower bound is considered for the filter performance evaluation allowing for the RL reward computation. The algorithm has been tested on a real-world dataset collected with mass-market hardware applying tightly-coupled IMU/GPS sensor integration. A positive RL model learning trend has been identified in two segments of the trajectory with the highest obstruction environment, suggesting the applicability potential of the technique.},

However, the performance of local-based methods varies for different structure, while the complexities of global-based methods are generally high for most situations. Here, we map the problem into an optimization issue based on global information of network structure and propose a belief propagation and node reinsertion (BPR) method with almost linear time complexity, where finding the minimum feeding back vertex set is a key. Compared with several state-of-the-art heuristic methods, the BPR method has advantages of high accuracy and practicability of vital nodes identification and low computational complexity. Under two attack schemes: static and dynamical, extensive experiments of Erdos-Rényi and scale-free models and real-world networks of the power grid and traffic network convincingly demonstrate that the BPR method remarkably outperforms other methods in vital nodes identification. This helps to reassess the operational risk of a network and improve robustness ranging from network design schemes, protection strategies to failure mitigation.},

abstract={The rapid proliferation of sensor-embedded devices has enabled the mobile crowdsensing (MCS), a new paradigm which effectively collects sensing data from pervasive users. In order to identify the true information from the noisy data submitted by unreliable users, truth discovery algorithms have been proposed for the MCS systems to aggregate data. However, the power of truth discovery algorithms will be undermined by the Sybil attack, in which an attacker can benefit from using multiple accounts. In addition, an MCS system will be jeopardized unless it is resistant to the Sybil attack. In this paper, we proposed a Sybil-resistant truth discovery framework for MCS, which ensures high accuracy under the Sybil attack. To diminish the impact of the Sybil attack, we design three account grouping methods for the framework, which are used in pair with a truth discovery algorithm. We evaluate the proposed framework through a real-world experiment. The results show that existing truth discovery algorithms are vulnerable to the Sybil attack, and the proposed framework can effectively diminish the impact of the Sybil attack.},

abstract={Identifying real-world business communities, e.g., Energy, finance, defense, in Internet traffic is a challenging problem but would be valuable for the construction of better in-trusion detection techniques, for example. Seed-based community detection identifies a community in a graph by iteratively adding the 'closest' vertices to an initial set of seed-vertices which are known to belong to the community. Previous research focused on unambiguous networks, where edges describe a specific intention in a fixed domain (e.g., A 'friend' in a social network) and tightly-knit communities whose members are better connected to each other ('close') than to the rest of the network. However, looking at a complete day of raw Internet traffic, we found that (1) the intend of a communication is ambiguous (e.g., ad-downloads are indistinguishable from web-page downloads) and (2) real-world industries manifest themselves as loosely-coupled communities, i.e., With more edges to non-community members than to community members. We present a new seed-based community detection algorithm that provides higher precision and recall in our setting than the related work. We show that this enables the detection of loosely-knit communities using three sample industries. For instance, our solution detected 111 individual energy companies with only 6 false positives, starting from eight ISOs (Independent System Operators) and RTO (Regional Transmission Operators) in the US.},

The early discovery of these attacks, although challenging, is necessary to protect end-users as well as the expensive network infrastructure resources. In this paper, we address the problem of DDoS attacks and present the theoretical foundation, architecture, and algorithms of FireCol. The core of FireCol is composed of intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) located at the Internet service providers (ISPs) level. The IPSs form virtual protection rings around the hosts to defend and collaborate by exchanging selected traffic information. The evaluation of FireCol using extensive simulations and a real dataset is presented, showing FireCol effectiveness and low overhead, as well as its support for incremental deployment in real networks.},

abstract={Many modern cities strive to integrate information technology into every aspect of city life to create so-called smart cities. Smart cities rely on a large number of application areas and technologies to realize complex interactions between citizens, third parties, and city departments. This overwhelming complexity is one reason why holistic privacy protection only rarely enters the picture. A lack of privacy can result in discrimination and social sorting, creating a fundamentally unequal society. To prevent this, we believe that a better understanding of smart cities and their privacy implications is needed. We therefore systematize the application areas, enabling technologies, privacy types, attackers, and data sources for the attacks, giving structure to the fuzzy term “smart city.” Based on our taxonomies, we describe existing privacy-enhancing technologies, review the state of the art in real cities around the world, and discuss promising future research directions. Our survey can serve as a reference guide, contributing to the development of privacy-friendly smart cities.},

abstract={The problem of making the classifier design resilient to test data falsification is considered. In the literature, a few countermeasures have been proposed to defend machine learning algorithms against test data falsification, but a common assumption employed therein is that feature entries of test data are equally vulnerable to falsification. When test data entries consist of data collected from various sources such as different types of sensor devices, vulnerability levels of data entries to falsification attacks can differ significantly depending on how data creation and transmission procedures are secured. In this paper, we present an attack-cost-aware adversarial learning framework that takes into account the (potentially inhomogeneous) vulnerability characteristics of test data entries in designing an attack-resilient classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach using experiments with the MNIST handwritten digit database.},

abstract={Peer to peer and distributed systems are generally susceptible to sybil attacks. Online social networks (OSNs), due to their fat user base and open access nature are also prone to such attacks. Current state-of-art algorithms for sybil attack detection make use of the inherent social graph created among registered users of OSN service. They rely on the inherent trust relationship among these users. No effort is made to combine other characteristic behavior of sybil users with properties of social graph of OSNs to improve detection accuracy of sybil attacks. Sybil identities are also used as gateways for spreading spam content in OSNs. The proposed approach exploits this behavior of sybil users to improve detection accuracy of existing sybil detection algorithms. In the proposed approach, content generated/published by each user is used along with the topological properties of the social graph of registered users. A machine learning model is used for assigning a fractional value called "trust value" which denotes the amount of legitimate content generated by the user. A modification to sybil detection algorithm is proposed which makes use of the trust value of each user to improve the accuracy of detecting a sybil identity. Real dataset from Facebook is crawled and used for analysis and experiments. Analytical results show the superiority of proposed solution. Results are compared with SybilGuard and SybilShield which shows ~14% decrease in false positive rates with very minimal effect on acceptance rate or false negative rate of the sybil detection algorithms. Also, the proposed modification does not affect the performance of existing sybil detection algorithms and can be implemented in a distributed manner.},

In this paper, we present an effective and practical scheme for detecting data integrity and selective forwarding attacks launched by malicious relays in wireless IoT networks. The proposed scheme exploits the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and provides a sentinel based approach to intrusion detection. Our detection scheme assumes a general noise model for the network where different wireless links may have different packet error probability (PEP). Further, our detection scheme is effective even in scenarios where different wireless links in the network employ distinct modulation and coding schemes at the physical layer. This detection scheme has application in practical wireless IoT networks, such as those based on the recently introduced IEEE 802.11ah standard.},

abstract={Pervasive growth and usage of the Internet and mobile applications have expanded cyberspace. The cyberspace has become more vulnerable to automated and prolonged cyberattacks. Cyber security techniques provide enhancements in security measures to detect and react against cyberattacks. The previously used security systems are no longer sufficient because cybercriminals are smart enough to evade conventional security systems. Conventional security systems lack efficiency in detecting previously unseen and polymorphic security attacks. Machine learning (ML) techniques are playing a vital role in numerous applications of cyber security. However, despite the ongoing success, there are significant challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness of ML systems. There are incentivized malicious adversaries present in the cyberspace that are willing to game and exploit such ML vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting cyberspace against attacks, by presenting a literature on ML techniques for cyber security including intrusion detection, spam detection, and malware detection on computer networks and mobile networks in the last decade. It also provides brief descriptions of each ML method, frequently used security datasets, essential ML tools, and evaluation metrics to evaluate a classification model. It finally discusses the challenges of using ML techniques in cyber security. This paper provides the latest extensive bibliography and the current trends of ML in cyber security.},

year={2017},
volume={},

pages={28-33},
abstract={Recent architectures for the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) have incorporated several back-end systems that handle billing and other smart grid control operations. The non-availability of metering data when needed or the untimely delivery of data needed for control operations will undermine the activities of these back-end systems. Unfortunately, there are concerns that cyber attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) will manifest in magnitude and complexity in a smart grid AMI network. Such attacks will range from a delay in the availability of end user's metering data to complete denial in the case of a grounded network. This paper proposes a cloud-based (IaaS) firewall for the mitigation of DDoS attacks in a smart grid AMI network. The proposed firewall has the ability of not only mitigating the effects of DDoS attack but can prevent the attack before they are launched. Our proposed firewall system leverages on cloud computing technology which has an added advantage of reducing the burden of data computations and storage for smart grid AMI back-end systems. The openflow firewall proposed in this study is a better security solution with regards to the traditional on-premises DoS solutions which cannot cope with the wide range of new attacks targeting the smart grid AMI network infrastructure. Simulation results generated from the study show that our model can guarantee the availability of metering/control data and could be used to improve the QoS of the smart grid AMI network under a DDoS attack scenario.},

abstract={One way to make more spectrum available is through white space sharing, where secondary spectrum users are allowed to transmit from any location except inside exclusion zones (EZs) that are drawn around primary spectrum users (PUs). However, EZ boundaries reveal the locations of PUs, and for some devices, location privacy is extremely important. Location privacy can be improved by increasing the area blocked inside EZs, but this decreases spectrum utilization efficiency. This paper derives a Pareto optimal strategy that builds on two such approaches: generating dummy PUs and creating EZs around them, and making EZs larger than needed for interference protection alone. We find that in many circumstances, including cases where an attacker threatens a jamming attack, the optimal strategy is to maximize the number of dummy PUs while making EZs as small as possible. In the remaining circumstances, the optimal strategy is to generate no dummy EZs. We derive the Pareto optimal results achieved by using whichever of these strategies is best for given circumstances, and show that the results are far superior to those achieved with some previously proposed algorithms. Moreover, with our approach, even a small increase in the amount of area blocked from secondary use can greatly improve location privacy for PUs, although as more and more area is blocked, there are diminishing returns.},

abstract={Vehicle detection and tracking is a core ingredient for developing autonomous driving applications in urban scenarios. Recent image-based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are obtaining breakthrough results in these perceptive tasks. However, DL research has not yet advanced much towards processing 3D point clouds from lidar range-finders. These sensors are very common in autonomous vehicles since, despite not providing as semantically rich information as images, their performance is more robust under harsh weather conditions than vision sensors. In this paper we present a full vehicle detection and tracking system that works with 3D lidar information only. Our detection step uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that receives as input a featured representation of the 3D information provided by a Velodyne HDL-64 sensor and returns a per-point classification of whether it belongs to a vehicle or not. The classified point cloud is then geometrically processed to generate observations for a multi-object tracking system implemented via a number of Multi-Hypothesis Extended Kalman Filters (MH-EKF) that estimate the position and velocity of the surrounding vehicles. The system is thoroughly evaluated on the KITTI tracking dataset, and we show the performance boost provided by our CNN-based vehicle detector over a standard geometric approach. Our lidar-based approach uses about a 4% of the data needed for an image-based detector with similarly competitive results.},

pages={3469-3478},
abstract={Windows malware detectors based on machine learning are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even if the attacker is only given black-box query access to the model. The main drawback of these attacks is that: ( $i$ ) they are query-inefficient, as they rely on iteratively applying random transformations to the input malware; and ( $ii$ ) they may also require executing the adversarial malware in a sandbox at each iteration of the optimization process, to ensure that its intrusive functionality is preserved. In this paper, we overcome these issues by presenting a novel family of black-box attacks that are both query-efficient and functionality-preserving, as they rely on the injection of benign content (which will never be executed) either at the end of the malicious file, or within some newly-created sections. Our attacks are formalized as a constrained minimization problem which also enables optimizing the trade-off between the probability of evading detection and the size of the injected payload. We empirically investigate this trade-off on two popular static Windows malware detectors, and show that our black-box attacks can bypass them with only few queries and small payloads, even when they only return the predicted labels. We also evaluate whether our attacks transfer to other commercial antivirus solutions, and surprisingly find that they can evade, on average, more than 12 commercial antivirus engines. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our approach, and its possible future extensions to target malware classifiers based on dynamic analysis.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology is prospering and entering every part of our lives, be it education, home, vehicles, or healthcare. With the increase in the number of connected devices, several challenges are also coming up with IoT technology: heterogeneity, scalability, quality of service, security requirements, and many more. Security management takes a back seat in IoT because of cost, size, and power. It poses a significant risk as lack of security makes users skeptical towards using IoT devices. This, in turn, makes IoT vulnerable to security attacks, ultimately causing enormous financial and reputational losses. It makes up for an urgent need to assess present security risks and discuss the upcoming challenges to be ready to face the same. The undertaken study is a multi-fold survey of different security issues present in IoT layers: perception layer, network layer, support layer, application layer, with further focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are significant threats for the cyber world because of their potential to bring down the victims. Different types of DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks in IoT devices, impacts of DDoS attacks, and solutions for mitigation are discussed in detail. The presented review work compares Intrusion Detection and Prevention models for mitigating DDoS attacks and focuses on Intrusion Detection models. Furthermore, the classification of Intrusion Detection Systems, different anomaly detection techniques, different Intrusion Detection System models based on datasets, various machine learning and deep learning techniques for data pre-processing and malware detection has been discussed. In the end, a broader perspective has been envisioned while discussing research challenges, its proposed solutions, and future visions.},

abstract={Authentication protocols are powerful tools to ensure confidentiality as an important feature of Internet of Things (IoT). The Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is one of the significant threats to availability, as another essential feature of IoT, which deprives users of services by consuming the energy of IoT nodes. On the other hand, computational intelligence algorithms can be applied to solve such issues in the network and cyber domains. Motivated by this, this article links these concepts. To do so, we analyze two lightweight authentication protocols, present a DoS attack inspired by users' misbehavior and suggest a solution called received signal strength, which is easy to compute, applicable for resisting against different kinds of vulnerabilities in Internet protocols, and feasible for practical implementations. We implement it on two scenarios for locating attackers, investigate the effects of IoT devices' internal error on locating, and propose an optimization problem to finding the exact location of attackers, which is efficiently solvable for computational intelligence algorithms, such as TLBO. Besides, we analyze the solutions for unreliable results of accurate devices and provide a solution to detect attackers with less than 12-cm error and the false alarm probability of 0.7%.},

abstract={With the advent of the big data era, information systems have exhibited some new features, including boundary obfuscation, system virtualization, unstructured and diversification of data types, and low coupling among function and data. These features not only lead to a big difference between big data technology (DT) and information technology (IT), but also promote the upgrading and evolution of network security technology. In response to these changes, in this paper we compare the characteristics between IT era and DT era, and then propose four DT security principles: privacy, integrity, traceability, and controllability, as well as active and dynamic defense strategy based on "propagation prediction, audit prediction, dynamic management and control". We further discuss the security challenges faced by DT and the corresponding assurance strategies. On this basis, the big data security technologies can be divided into four levels: elimination, continuation, improvement, and innovation. These technologies are analyzed, combed and explained according to six categories: access control, identification and authentication, data encryption, data privacy, intrusion prevention, security audit and disaster recovery. The results will support the evolution of security technologies in the DT era, the construction of big data platforms, the designation of security assurance strategies, and security technology choices suitable for big data.},

abstract={In recent years, mobile devices are equipped with increasingly advanced sensing and computing capabilities. Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in FL.},

abstract={Due to their proven efficiency, machine-learning systems are deployed in a wide range of complex real-life problems. More specifically, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerged as a promising solution to the accuracy, resource-utilization, and energy-efficiency challenges in machine-learning systems. While these systems are going mainstream, they have inherent security and reliability issues. In this paper, we propose NeuroAttack, a cross-layer attack that threatens the SNNs integrity by exploiting low-level reliability issues through a high-level attack. Particularly, we trigger a fault-injection based sneaky hardware backdoor through a carefully crafted adversarial input noise. Our results on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and SNNs show a serious integrity threat to state-of-the art machine-learning techniques.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of “things,” connected via Internet, to collect and exchange data. These “things” can be sensors, actuators, smartphones, wearables, computers, or any object that is interconnected to provide specific services. Similarly, wireless sensor network (WSN), as a part of IoT, forwards the gathered data after sensing any event. The scalability and heterogeneity of IoT offer limited protection and is prone to diverse attacks, including WSN-inherited attacks. Moreover, IPv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL), a de facto routing protocol for IoT networks, also suffers from certain vulnerabilities based on its features and functionalities. Researchers have proposed various mitigation mechanisms for secure networks and routing in IoT. Recently, trust-based approaches have gained tremendous interest from the research community to embed security in IoT networks and routing protocols. In the existing literature, several trust models have been introduced according to the security needs of the IoT system, such as SecTrust, DCTM-IoT, CTRUST, etc. In this research, security issues and requirements of IoT networks and RPL routing protocol are studied with respect to various attacks, such as Blackhole, Spoofing, Rank, etc. Additionally, various mitigation methods and significance of trust models in IoT for secure routing are analyzed. Further, trust metrics in IoT environments, including the open issues and research challenges, as well as the implication of trust as a security paradigm in IoT networks and routing protocols are discussed.},

pages={201-207},
abstract={Most of the recent literature investigates mathematical analyses performed on the simulated behavior of the delay physically unclonable function (PUF). These analyses are not sufficient to characterize the PUF leakage under actual operating conditions, and it is hard to model the distribution of the noise that might confuse the assessment of the PUF. Furthermore, simulated analyses may lead to an overestimation of the risk. We show that the availability of an embedded image of the target PUF is important for assessing security against real attacks by considering different input conditions. In this paper, we propose a delay PUF assessment method that combines side-channel analyses and modeling analyses. Our proposed method is the last piece of the all-in-one methodology to assess the security of the delay PUF. Finally, we conduct an experiment to evaluate a real arbiter-PUF (APUF) with our proposed assessment method. Our result shows that a modeling analysis using random forest (RF) and advanced support vector machine (SVM) are suitable for the APUF in the assessment method.},

This way we can accurately pinpoint which (possibly) malicious behaviors are shared between these different samples, allowing for easier analysis and classification.We implement this approach in a tool, StrAndroid, that we evaluate on a few dataset of malware and ransomware samples, comparing its results to an existing similarity tool.},

abstract={As we race toward the Internet of Things (IoT), small embedded devices are increasingly becoming network-enabled. Often, these devices can't meet the computational requirements of current intrusion prevention mechanisms or designers prioritize additional features and services over security; as a result, many IoT devices are vulnerable to attack. We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device. We demonstrate near perfect payload discrimination for data captured from off the shelf IoT devices.},

pages={92419-92435},
abstract={The IoT edge/sensor nodes are exposed to large attack surface and could easily succumb to several well-known attacks in the wireless sensor network (WSN) domain. Authenticating edge nodes before they join a network, especially after a sleep state, is a critical step to maintain the overall trust of any given IoT local area network (IoT LAN). The low resources and computational constraints of such IoT nodes make this a challenging and non-trivial problem. As many IoT deployments are in uncontrolled environments, the IoT devices are often placed in the open so that physical access to them is inevitable. Due to easy physical access of the devices, common attacks, including cloning of devices or stealing secret keys stored in an edge node, are some of the most common attacks on the IoT deployments. This paper focuses on developing an extremely lightweight authentication scheme for constrained end-devices that are part of a given IoT LAN. Authentication occurs between the end-device and the gateway that acts as an edge computing device. The proposed authentication scheme is put through both formal and informal security verification. Voltage drop, current, and power are measured to gauge the overall impact of the security scheme. All the three parameters were measured while configuring the edge node as an end-device or as a router. Our testing results show that the impact on the resources was minimal.},

pages={693-710},
abstract={Today search engines are tightly coupled with social networks, and present users with a double-edged sword: they are able to acquire information interesting to users but are also capable of spreading viruses introduced by hackers. It is challenging to characterize how a search engine spreads viruses, since the search engine serves as a virtual virus pool and creates propagation paths over the underlying network structure. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze virus propagation effects and the stability of the virus propagation process in the presence of a search engine. First, although social networks have a community structure that impedes virus propagation, we find that a search engine generates a propagation wormhole. Second, we propose an epidemic feedback model and quantitatively analyze propagation effects based on a model employing four metrics: infection density, the propagation wormhole effect, the epidemic threshold, and the basic reproduction number. Third, we verify our analyses on four real-world data sets and two simulated data sets. Moreover, we prove that the proposed model has the property of partial stability. Evaluation results show that, compared the cases without a search engine, virus propagation with the search engine has a higher infection density, shorter network diameter, greater propagation velocity, lower epidemic threshold, and larger basic reproduction number.},

abstract={Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are among the main targets of activists, cyber terrorists and state sponsored attacks. To protect itself, a CI needs to build and keep updated a domestic knowledge base of cyber threats. It cannot indeed completely rely on external service providers because information on incidents can be so sensible to impact national security. In this paper, we propose an architecture for a malware analysis framework to support CIs in such a challenging task. Given the huge number of new malware produced daily, the architecture is designed so as to automate the analysis to a large extent, leaving to human analysts only a small and manageable part of the whole effort. Such a non-automatic part of the analysis requires a wide range of expertise, usually contributed by more analysts. The architecture enables analysts to work collaboratively to improve the understanding of samples that demand deeper investigations (intra-CI collaboration). Furthermore, the architecture allows to share partial and configurable views of the knowledge base with other interested CIs, in order to collectively obtain a more complete vision of the cyber threat landscape (inter-CI collaboration).},

abstract={We consider the problem of dense depth prediction from a sparse set of depth measurements and a single RGB image. Since depth estimation from monocular images alone is inherently ambiguous and unreliable, to attain a higher level of robustness and accuracy, we introduce additional sparse depth samples, which are either acquired with a low-resolution depth sensor or computed via visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. We propose the use of a single deep regression network to learn directly from the RGB-D raw data, and explore the impact of number of depth samples on prediction accuracy. Our experiments show that, compared to using only RGB images, the addition of 100 spatially random depth samples reduces the prediction root-mean-square error by 50% on the NYU-Depth-v2 indoor dataset. It also boosts the percentage of reliable prediction from 59% to 92% on the KITTI dataset. We demonstrate two applications of the proposed algorithm: a plug-in module in SLAM to convert sparse maps to dense maps, and super-resolution for LiDARs.

We propose an attack and defense for split manufacturing for flattened designs. Our attack uses a network-flow model and outperforms previous attacks.

abstract={The ubiquity of mobile sensing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) enables an emerging data crowdsourcing paradigm called participatory sensing, where multiple individuals collect data and use a cloud service to analyse the union of the collected data. An example of such collaborative analysis is collaborative anomaly detection. Given the possibility that the cloud service is honest but curious, a major challenge is how to protect the participants' privacy. The scheme called Random Multiparty Perturbation (RMP) addresses this challenge by allowing each participant to perturb his/her tabular data by passing the data through a nonlinear function, and projecting the data to a lower dimension using a participant-specific random matrix. Here, we propose an improvement to RMP by introducing a new nonlinear function. The improved scheme is assessed in terms of its recovery resistance to the maximum a priori (MAP) estimation attack. Experimental results and preliminary theoretical analysis indicate that RMP is resistant to collusion attacks and has better recovery resistance to MAP estimation attacks compared to the original scheme. It also achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and privacy.},

abstract={To boost up power of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, there has been a great effort in optimizing network structure to learn more efficient high level features. It is crucial for a network to have a sufficient amount of learnable parameters yet still be able to capture in variances in data. In this paper, the authors propose spatial boosting networks, which employ convolutional feature learning networks as learning components. Each component in a network is assigned to a certain spatial region. This allows the network learn more adaptive features for each region. In order to make spatial boosting networks to capture relationship between regions of the visual field, we also propose convolutional pooling procedure. By expanding pooling scope into overlapping regions, we expect the features pooled in higher level to be more robust to noises and more invariant to transformation. Experiments show that using spatial boosting networks boosts up accuracy up to 3% from conventional approaches in standard datasets CIFAR and STL. Moreover, these results are competitive in comparison with other methods by using only a basic feature learning algorithm.},

abstract={As tremendous growth of information in the internet, the importance of Network security also dramatically increases. Network and Host based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are two primary systems in Network Security infrastructure. When new intrusion types are appeared in Network or Host, some serious problems are also appeared to detect these new intrusions. Due to this reason, IDSs demanded better than Signature based detection. The action of intrusion is represented by some features and collects the corresponding featured data from these uncertain feature characteristics. In last two decades, several techniques are developed to detect intrusion by using these data as human labeling which is very time consuming and expensive process. In this paper, we proposed a data mining rule based algorithm called Decision Table (DT) to detect intrusion and a new feature selection process to remove irrelevant/correlated features simultaneously. An empirical analysis on KDD'99 cup dataset was performed by using our proposed and some other existence feature selection techniques with DT and some others classification algorithms. The experimental results showed that proposed approach provides better performance in accuracy and cost compared among Bayesian Network, Naïve Bayes Classifier and other developed algorithms with data mining KDD'99 cup challenge in all cases.},

abstract={Malware, like any other software, is developed iteratively and improved in incremental versions over a long period of time. Malware economics requires amortizing the cost of malware development over several attacks. Thus, the malware code persists through many incremental versions of the malware-albeit in a transformed and obfuscated state-while the classic indicators of attack, e.g., domain names, file names, and IP addresses, are parameterized and often change with each new version. Recent breakthroughs in automated malware analysis and code debofuscation make it possible to overcome the challenges imposed by code obfuscation and create new anti-malware tools that use the malware code itself as an immutable indicator in anti-malware defense. The resulting technologies can be used to provide situational awareness of the dynamic threat profile of an organization. A persistent adversary that intends to penetrate a particular organization will send morphed variants of the same malware to a large number of people in an organization. Such an attack campaign may be executed over weeks or months. By correlating malware generated from the same code base, one can detect such persistent campaigns against an organization using the malware blocked by an anti-virus. Results from the field demonstrate that this approach has promise in detecting targeted attacks while the attacks are in progress thus giving the defenders' enough time to take preventive actions.},

As a response to the adversarial malware classification challenge organized by the MIT Lincoln Lab and associated with the AAAI-19 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS'2019), we propose six guiding principles to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks. Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but the others are introduced in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of these six principles, we propose a defense framework to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. By conducting experiments with the Drebin Android malware dataset, we show that the framework can achieve a 98.49% accuracy (on average) against grey-box attacks, where the attacker knows some information about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack, and an 89.14% accuracy (on average) against the more capable white-box attacks, where the attacker knows everything about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack. The framework wins the AICS'2019 challenge by achieving a 76.02% accuracy, where neither the attacker (i.e., the challenge organizer) knows the framework or defense nor we (the defender) know the attacks. This gap highlights the importance of knowing about the attack.},

abstract={The dynamically changing landscape of DDoS threats increases the demand for advanced security solutions. The rise of massive IoT botnets enables attackers to mount high-intensity short-duration ”volatile ephemeral” attack waves in quick succession. Therefore the standard human-in-the-loop security center paradigm is becoming obsolete. To battle the new breed of volatile DDoS threats, the intrusion detection system (IDS) needs to improve markedly, at least in reaction times and in automated response (mitigation). Designing such an IDS is a daunting task as network operators are traditionally reluctant to act - at any speed - on potentially false alarms. The primary challenge of a low reaction time detection system is maintaining a consistently low false alarm rate. This paper aims to show how a practical FPGA-based DDoS detection and mitigation system can successfully address this. Besides verifying the model and algorithms with real traffic ”in the wild”, we validate the low false alarm ratio. Accordingly, we describe a methodology for determining the false alarm ratio for each involved threat type, then we categorize the causes of false detection, and provide our measurement results. As shown here, our methods can effectively mitigate the volatile ephemeral DDoS attacks, and accordingly are usable both in human out-of-loop and on-the-loop next-generation security solutions.},

abstract={Hardware security and trust have become a pressing issue during the last two decades due to the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain and ubiquitous network connection of computing devices. Computing hardware is now an attractive attack surface for launching powerful cross-layer security attacks, allowing attackers to infer secret information, hijack control flow, compromise system root-of-trust, steal intellectual property (IP), and fool machine learners. On the other hand, security practitioners have been making tremendous efforts in developing protection techniques and design tools to detect hardware vulnerabilities and fortify hardware design against various known hardware attacks. This article presents an overview of hardware security and trust from the perspectives of threats, countermeasures, and design tools. By introducing the most recent advances in hardware security research and developments, we aim to motivate hardware designers and electronic design automation tool developers to consider the new challenges and opportunities of incorporating an additional dimension of security into robust hardware design, testing, and verification.},

abstract={Modern LTE (Long Term Evolution) cellular networks provide advanced services for billions of users that go beyond traditional voice and short messaging traffic. The recent trend of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks impacting the availability of communication systems illustrate the importance of strengthening the resiliency of mobility networks against Denial of Service (DoS) and DDoS threats, ensuring this way full LTE network availability against security attacks. In parallel, the advent of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) has capsized the common assumptions about attackers and threats. When it comes to very well planned and funded cyber-attacks, the scale of the threat is not the key element anymore. Instead, scenarios such as a local DoS attack, for example, against the cell service around a large corporation's headquarters or the Stock Exchange become very relevant. Therefore, traditionally overlooked low range threats, such as radio jamming, should not be de-prioritized in security studies. In this paper we present an overview of the current threat landscape against the availability of LTE mobility networks. We identify a set of areas of focus that should be considered in mobility security in order to guarantee availability against security attacks. Finally, we introduce potential research directions, including a new attack detection layer, to tackle these problems. The final goal is to rethink the architecture of a mobility network within the current security context and threat landscape and considering the current evolution towards a near future scenario where nearly every electronic device will be connected through Machine-to-Machine (M2M) systems.},

In the deep learning-based Web malicious code detection methods, the effect and applicability of different RNN-based methods are unknown, which needs to be further study. Therefore, a comparative study of RNN-based methods for Web malicious code detection was conducted in this paper. Different from existing research, this paper not only analyzes and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different RNN-based methods, including LSTM, GRU, SRU, but also utilizes Web malicious code detection as the application target to evaluate the actual performance of these methods. Experiment results show that the recall rates of GRU and SRU are 81.07% and 80.96%, respectively, which are higher than LSTM and minimalRNN. The performance of textCNN is relatively satisfactory, with scores of 90.6%, 85.54%, 87.95%, 94.4% in terms of precision, recall, F1 and AUC respectively. The comparative study displays that the performance of RNN-based Web malicious code detection methods is greatly affected by the preprocessing ways of source code.},

year={2020},

abstract={A trojan backdoor is a hidden pattern typically implanted in a deep neural network (DNN). It could be activated and thus forces that infected model to behave abnormally when an input sample with a particular trigger is fed to that model. As such, given a DNN and clean input samples, it is challenging to inspect and determine the existence of a trojan backdoor. Recently, researchers design and develop several pioneering solutions to address this problem. They demonstrate that the proposed techniques have great potential in trojan detection. However, we show that none of these existing techniques completely address the problem. On the one hand, they mostly work under an unrealistic assumption of assuming the availability of the contaminated training database. On the other hand, these techniques can neither accurately detect the existence of trojan backdoors, nor restore high-fidelity triggers, especially when infected models are trained with high-dimensional data, and the triggers pertaining to the trojan vary in size, shape, and position. In this work, we propose TABOR, a new trojan detection technique. Conceptually, it formalizes the detection of a trojan backdoor as solving an optimization objective function. Different from the existing technique which also models trojan detection as an optimization problem, TABOR first designs a new objective function that could guide optimization to identify a trojan backdoor more correctly and accurately. Second, TABOR borrows the idea of interpretable AI to further prune the restored triggers. Last, TABOR designs a new anomaly detection method, which could not only facilitate the identification of intentionally injected triggers but also filter out false alarms (i.e., triggers detected from an uninfected model). We train 112 DNNs on five datasets and infect these models with two existing trojan attacks. We evaluate TABOR by using these infected models, and demonstrate that TABOR has much better performance in trigger restoration, trojan detection, and elimination than Neural Cleanse, the state-of-the-art trojan detection technique.},

abstract={Automatic Speaker Analysis has largely focused on single aspects of a speaker such as her ID, gender, emotion, personality, or health state. This broadly ignores the interdependency of all the different states and traits impacting on the one single voice production mechanism available to a human speaker. In other words, sometimes we may sound depressed, but we simply have a flu, and hardly find the energy to put more vocal effort into our articulation and sound production. Recently, this lack gave rise to an increasingly holistic speaker analysis - assessing the `larger picture' in one pass such as by multi-target learning. However, for a robust assessment, this requires large amount of speech and language resources labelled in rich ways to train such interdependency, and architectures able to cope with multi-target learning of massive amounts of speech data. In this light, this contribution will discuss efficient mechanisms such as large socialmedia pre-scanning with dynamic cooperative crowd-sourcing for rapid data collection, cross-task-labelling of these data in a wider range of attributes to reach `big & rich' speech data, and efficient multi-target end-to-end and end-to-evolution deep learning paradigms to learn an accordingly rich representation of diverse target tasks in efficient ways. The ultimate goal behind is to enable machines to hear the `entire' person and her condition and whereabouts behind the voice and words - rather than aiming at a single aspect blind to the overall individual and its state, thus leading to the next level of Automatic Speaker Analysis.},

abstract={As organizations become ever more dependent on networked operations, they are increasingly vulnerable to attack by a variety of attackers, including criminals, terrorists and nation states using cyber attacks. New malware attacks, including viruses, Trojans, and worms, are constantly and rapidly emerging threats. However, attackers often reuse code and techniques from previous attacks. Both by recognizing the reused elements from previous attacks and by detecting patterns in the types of modification and reuse observed, we can more rapidly develop defenses, make hypotheses about the source of the malware, and predict and prepare to defend against future attacks. We achieve these objectives in Malware Analysis and Attribution using Genetic Information (MAAGI) by adapting and extending concepts from biology and linguistics. First, analyzing the “genetics” of malware (i.e., reverse engineered representations of the original program) provides critical information about the program that is not available by looking only at the executable program. Second, the evolutionary process of malware (i.e., the transformation from one species of malware to another) can provide insights into the ancestry of malware, characteristics of the attacker, and where future attacks might come from and what they might look like. Third, functional linguistics is the study of the intent behind communicative acts; its application to malware characterization can support the study of the intent behind malware behaviors. To this point in the program, we developed a system that uses a range of reverse engineering techniques, including static, dynamic, behavioral, and functional analysis that clusters malware into families. We are also able to determine the malware lineage in some situations. Using behavioral and functional analysis, we are also able to identify a number of functions and purposes of malware.},

abstract={Whether robot controllers are manually designed or synthesized from high-level task specifications, assumptions about the environment need to be made, which can involve adversarial events or cooperative robots.

In this paper, we focus on controllers synthesized from linear temporal logic. We tackle the problem of making these controllers robust against environment assumption violations that are common in robot execution. Our solution is a three-layer system: first, we propose an offline approach that accounts for transient violations such that the robot can still complete its task after temporary anomalies; the second layer is an online approach that automatically relaxes the environment assumptions to better capture environment behaviors and that allows the robot to react accordingly; and, finally, we automatically modify the actual environment behaviors, when possible, through negotiation with one of the environment robots operating in the workspace, such that our assumptions are met by the other robot and both robots accomplish their tasks.},

pages={535-545},
abstract={The Rowhammer bug is a novel micro-architectural security threat, enabling powerful privilege-escalation attacks on various mainstream platforms. It works by actively flipping bits in Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) cells with unprivileged instructions. In order to set up Rowhammer against binaries in the Linux page cache, the Waylaying algorithm has previously been proposed. The Waylaying method stealthily relocates binaries onto exploitable physical addresses without exhausting system memory. However, the proof-of-concept Waylaying algorithm can be easily detected during page cache eviction because of its high disk I/O overhead and long running time. This paper proposes the more advanced Memway algorithm, which improves on Waylaying in terms of both I/O overhead and speed. Running time and disk I/O overhead are reduced by 90% by utilizing Linux tmpfs and inmemory swapping to manage eviction files. Furthermore, by combining Memway with the unprivileged posix fadvise API, the binary relocation step is made 100 times faster. Equipped with our Memway+fadvise relocation scheme, we demonstrate practical Rowhammer attacks that take only 15-200 minutes to covertly relocate a victim binary, and less than 3 seconds to flip the target instruction bit.},

However, traditional deep learning models may suffer the privacy risk due to some training data involve sensitive information, such as the medical histories, location information and face images. Attackers can exploit the implicit information to recover the sensitive information from the training data. In order to protecting privacy of deep learning model, we develop a novel optimization algorithm called DPAGDCNN for convolution neural network which cooperates differential privacy technique. Specifically, DPAGD-CNN allocates privacy budgets more carefully in each iteration, rather than assigning a fixed privacy budget per iteration. We theoretically prove that our approach can protect the privacy of training data and it achieves higher classification accuracy under the moderate privacy budget in the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.},

abstract={Containerization is revolutionizing the way that many industries operate, provisioning major impact to modern computing technologies because it is extra lightweight, highly portable, energy, resource and storage efficient, cost-effective, performance efficient, and extremely quick during boot up. These often facilitate efficient load balancing, low-level system maintenance, server consolidation (for efficient energy and resource utilization) and replication of instances over geographical locations for better fault tolerance to escalate application reliability. However, some recent literature have addressed various challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports, security issues, and lack of available, capable container management APIs, etc.) regarding successful container adoption in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager increase in industrial deployments of containerization over the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has still not been found in contemporary literature, which further extends knowledge gap between developers and available technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different technicalities involved in containerization with potential problems and possible solutions along with various important industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and technical hardships. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive experimental study to compare the performance of VMs, containers and unikernels in terms of CPU utilization, memory footprints, network bandwidth, execution time and technological maturity using standard benchmarks and observed containers to deliver satisfactory performance in almost all aspects, however, are still not free from issues regarding isolation & security, performance stability, lack of available efficient tools for crossplatform support and persistent storage. Unikernels deliver good performance with VM-like isolation but still need to achieve desired technical maturity (in terms of microprocessor stability, process containment, persistent storage, etc.). VMs, on the other hand, are found to provide stable performance throughout, though bigger memory footprints and slower spin up/down remain their biggest weaknesses.},

abstract={5G is the fifth-generation cellular network satisfying the requirements IMT-2020 (International Mobile Telecommunications-2020) of the International Telecommunication Union. Mobile network operators started using it worldwide in 2019. Generally, 5G achieves exceptionally high values of performance parameters of access and transmission. The application of edge servers has been proposed to facilitate implementing such requirements of 5G, resulting in 5G MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) technology. Moreover, to optimize services for specific business applications, the concept of 5G vertical industries has been proposed. In this article, we study how the application of the MEC technology affects the functioning of 5G MEC-based services. We consider twelve representative vertical industries of 5G MEC by presenting their essential characteristics, threats, vulnerabilities, and known attacks. Furthermore, we analyze their functional properties, give efficiency patterns and identify the effect of applying the MEC technology in 5G on the resultant network’s quality parameters to determine the expected security requirements. As a result of the research, we identify the impact of classified threats on the 5G empowered vertical industries and identify the most sensitive cases to focus on their protection against network attacks in the first place.},

abstract={Of various Human-Computer-Interactions (HCI), hand gesture based HCI might be the most natural and intuitive way to communicate between people and machines, since it closely mimics how human interact with each other. Its intuitiveness and naturalness have spawned many applications in exploring large and complex data, computer games, virtual reality, health care, etc. Although the market for hand gesture based HCI is huge, building a robust hand gesture recognition system remains a challenging problem for traditional vision-based approaches, which are greatly limited by the quality of the input from optical sensors. [16] proposed a novel dissimilarity distance metric for hand gesture recognition using Kinect sensor, called Finger-Earth Mover's Distance (FEMD). In this paper, we compare the performance in terms of speed and accuracy between FEMD and traditional corresponding-based shape matching algorithm, Shape Context. And then we introduce several HCI applications built on top of a accurate and robust hand gesture recognition system based on FEMD. This hand gesture recognition system performs robustly despite variations in hand orientation, scale or articulation. Moreover, it works well in uncontrolled environments with background clusters. We demonstrate that this robust hand gesture recognition system can be a key enabler for numerous hand gesture based HCI systems.},

abstract={The IEEE 802.16 standard was proposed to provide Broadband Wireless Access for fixed and nomadic subscribers. However, Shon et al identified three vulnerabilities in the existing 802.16 standards. The vulnerabilities are 1) important messages sent during the initial network entry process are not secured in the existing 802.16 standard, 2) there are some Access Network vulnerabilities (the IEEE 802.16 standard does not cover the security of intra-Access Service Network (intra-ASN) and ASN-to-Connectivity Service Network (ASN-to-CSN) communications) and 3) the Hand Over (HO) optimization flags are able to allow malicious users to cause critical security vulnerabilities during the handover process. Shon et al then proposed countermeasures for the above-mentioned vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review Shon et al's countermeasures to initial network entry and Access Network vulnerabilities and show that their proposed countermeasures are ineffective in preventing attacks to initial network entry and access network communications. We then proposed improved countermeasures that are able to protect against initial network entry and access network communications vulnerabilities.},

abstract={In this work we adopt a novel approach for the detection of rectangular directional road signs in single frames captured from a moving car. These signs exhibit wide variations in sizes and aspect ratios and may contain arbitrary information, thus making their detection a challenging task with applications in traffic sign recognition systems and vision-based localization. Our proposed approach was originally presented for additional traffic sign detection in small image regions and is generalized to full image frames in this work. Sign corner areas are detected by four ACF-detectors (Aggregated Channel Features) on a single scale. The resulting corner detections are subsequently used to generate quadrangle hypotheses, followed by an aggressive pruning strategy. A comparative evaluation on a database of 1500 German road signs shows that our proposed detector outperforms other methods significantly at close to real-time runtimes and yields thrice the very low error-rate of the recent MS-CNN framework while being two orders of magnitude faster.},

abstract={Software defined networking implements the network control plane in an external entity, rather than in each individual device as in conventional networks. This architectural difference implies a different design for control functions necessary for essential network properties, e.g., loop prevention and link redundancy. We explore how such differences redefine the security weaknesses in the SDN control plane and provide a framework for comparative analysis which focuses on essential network properties required by typical production networks. This enables analysis of how these properties are delivered by the control planes of SDN and conventional networks, and to compare security threats and mitigations. Despite the architectural difference, we find similar, but not identical, exposures in control plane security if both network paradigms provide the same network properties and are analyzed under the same threat model. However, defenses vary; SDN cannot depend on edge based filtering to protect its control plane, while this is arguably the primary defense in conventional networks. Our concrete security analysis suggests that a distributed SDN architecture that supports fault tolerance and consistency checks is important for SDN control plane security. Our analysis methodology may be of independent interest for future security analysis of SDN and conventional networks.},

abstract={Classification models for multivariate time series have drawn the interest of many researchers to the field with the objective of developing accurate and efficient models. However, limited research has been conducted on generating adversarial samples for multivariate time series classification models. Adversarial samples could become a security concern in systems with complex sets of sensors. This study proposes extending the existing gradient adversarial transformation network (GATN) in combination with adversarial autoencoders to attack multivariate time series classification models. The proposed model attacks classification models by utilizing a distilled model to imitate the output of the multivariate time series classification model. In addition, the adversarial generator function is replaced with a variational autoencoder to enhance the adversarial samples. The developed methodology is tested on two multivariate time series classification models: 1-nearest neighbor dynamic time warping (1-NN DTW) and a fully convolutional network (FCN). This study utilizes 30 multivariate time series benchmarks provided by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and University of California Riverside (UCR). The use of adversarial autoencoders shows an increase in the fraction of successful adversaries generated on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore adversarial attacks on multivariate time series. Additionally, we recommend future research utilizing the generated latent space from the variational autoencoders.},

abstract={The constant miniaturization of hardware and an increase in power efficiency, have made possible the integration of intelligence into ordinary devices. This trend of augmenting so-called non-intelligent everyday devices with computational capabilities has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. With a wide variety of applications, such as home automation, smart grids/cities, and critical infrastructure management, the IoT systems make compelling targets for cyber-attacks. In order to effectively compromise these systems, adversaries employ different advanced persistent threat (APT) methods, with one such sophisticated method, being botnets. By employing a plethora of infected machines (bots), attackers manage to compromise the IoT systems and exploit them. Prior to the appearance of the IoT domain, specialized digital forensics mechanisms were developed, in order to investigate Botnet activities in small-scale systems. Since IoT enabled botnets are scalable, technologically diverse and make use of current high-speed networks, developing forensic mechanisms capable of investigating the IoT Botnet activities has become an important challenge in the cyber-security field. Various studies have proposed, deep learning as a viable solution for handling the IoT generated data, as it was designed to handle diverse data in large volumes, requiring near real-time processing. In this study, we provide a review of forensics and deep learning mechanisms employed to investigate botnets and their applicability in the IoT environments. We provide a new definition for the IoT, in addition to a taxonomy of network forensic solutions, that were developed for both conventional, as well as, the IoT settings. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of deep learning in network forensics, the inherent challenges of applying network forensics techniques to the IoT, and provide future direction for research in this field.},

abstract={With the explosive growth of online images and the popularity of search engines, a great demand has arisen for small and medium-sized enterprises to build and outsource large-scale image retrieval systems to cloud platforms. While reducing storage and retrieval burdens, enterprises are at risk of facing untrusted cloud service providers. In this paper, we take the first step in studying the problem of query authentication for large-scale image retrieval. Due to the large size of image files, the main challenges are to (i) design efficient authenticated data structures (ADSs) and (ii) balance search, communication, and verification complexities. To address these challenges, we propose two novel ADSs, the Merkle randomized k-d tree and the Merkle inverted index with cuckoo filters, to ensure the integrity of query results in each step of image retrieval. For each ADS, we develop corresponding search and verification algorithms on the basis of a series of systemic design strategies. Furthermore, we put together the ADSs and algorithms to design the final authentication scheme for image retrieval, which we name ImageProof. We also propose several optimization techniques to improve the performance of the proposed ImageProof scheme. Security analysis and extensive experiments are performed to show the robustness and efficiency of ImageProof.},

abstract={The sheer volume of IoT networks being deployed today presents a major “attack surface” and poses significant security risks at a scale never encountered before. In other words, a single IoT device/node that gets infected with malware has the potential to spread the malicious activities across the network, eventually ceasing the network functionality or compromising the network. Simply detecting and quarantining the malware in IoT networks does not guarantee preventing malware propagation. On the other hand, use of traditional control theory for malware confinement is not effective, as most of the existing works do not consider real-time malware control strategies that can be implemented using uncertain infection information from the nodes in the network or have the containment problem decoupled from network performance. In response, in this work, we propose a two-pronged approach with malware detection at node-level, and confinement of malware at network-level. We deploy a recently proposed lightweight runtime malware detector at the node-level that employs Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) values for malware detection. This node-level malware information is combined with the malware propagation information and then fed during runtime to a stochastic predictive controller to confine the malware propagation without hampering the network performance. Synthesizing the node-level malware information with the model predictive containment strategy leads to achieving an average network throughput of nearly 200% of that of IoT network without any defense, and up to 160% of that of network with commonly employed state-of-the-art heuristic approaches for malware confinement. Furthermore, to scale with ever-increasing network topology sizes, we introduce a novel multi-attribute graph translation that can predict the network topology and node state information when provided with a snapshot of topology and node-level malware infection. The proposed multi-attribute graph translation has <; 5.88 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the model predictive containment strategy and has shown nearly constant graph translation time and limited resource utilization independent of the network size.},

abstract={Point cloud registration is a key problem for computer vision applied to robotics, medical imaging, and other applications. This problem involves finding a rigid transformation from one point cloud into another so that they align. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and its variants provide simple and easily-implemented iterative methods for this task, but these algorithms can converge to spurious local optima. To address local optima and other difficulties in the ICP pipeline, we propose a learning-based method, titled Deep Closest Point (DCP), inspired by recent techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. Our model consists of three parts: a point cloud embedding network, an attention-based module combined with a pointer generation layer to approximate combinatorial matching, and a differentiable singular value decomposition (SVD) layer to extract the final rigid transformation. We train our model end-to-end on the ModelNet40 dataset and show in several settings that it performs better than ICP, its variants (e.g., Go-ICP, FGR), and the recently-proposed learning-based method PointNetLK. Beyond providing a state-of-the-art registration technique, we evaluate the suitability of our learned features transferred to unseen objects. We also provide preliminary analysis of our learned model to help understand whether domain-specific and/or global features facilitate rigid registration.},

abstract={IP spoofing-based flooding attacks are a serious and open security problem on the current Internet. The best current antispoofing practices have long been implemented in modern routers. However, they are not sufficiently applied due to the lack of deployment incentives, i.e., an autonomous system (AS) can hardly gain additional protection by deploying them. In this paper, we propose mutual egress filtering (MEF), a novel antispoofing method, which provides continuous deployment incentives. The MEF is implemented on the AS border routers using access control lists (ACLs). It drops an outbound packet whose source address does not belong to the local AS if the packet is related to a spoofing attack against other MEF-enabled ASes. By this means, only the deployers of the MEF can gain protection, whereas nondeployers cannot free ride. As more ASes deploy MEF, deployment incentives become higher. We present the system design of MEF, and propose an optimal prefix compression algorithm to compact the ACL into the routers' limited hardware resource. With theoretical analysis and simulations with real Internet data, our evaluation results show that MEF is the only method that achieves monotonically increasing deployment incentives for all types of spoofing attacks, and the system design is lightweight and practical. The prefix compression algorithm advances the state-of-the-art by generalizing the functionalities and reducing the overhead in both time and space.},

Common applications include its use for military operations, monitoring environmental conditions (such as volcano detection, agriculture, and management), distributed control systems, healthcare, and the detection of radioactive sources. Notwithstanding its promising attributes, security in WSN is a big challenge and remains an ongoing research trend. Deployed sensor nodes are vulnerable to various security attacks due to its architecture, hostile deployment location, and insecure routing protocol. Furthermore, the sensor nodes in WSNs are characterized by their resource constraints, such as, limited energy, low bandwidth, short communication range, limited processing, and storage capacity, which have made the sensor nodes an easy target. Therefore, in this paper, we present a review of denial of service attacks that affect resource availability in WSN and their countermeasure by presenting a taxonomy.

abstract={Nowadays, with the widespread diffusion of online image databases, the possibility of easily searching, browsing and filtering image content is more than an urge. Typically, this operation is made possible thanks to the use of tags, i.e., textual representations of semantic concepts associated to the images. The tagging process is either performed by users, who manually label the images, or by automatic image classifiers, so as to reach a broader coverage. Typically, these methods rely on the extraction of local descriptors (e.g., SIFT, SURF, HOG, etc.), the construction of a suitable feature-based representation (e.g., bag-of-visual words), and the use of supervised classifiers (e.g., SVM). In this paper, we show that such a classification procedure can be attacked by a malicious user, who might be interested in altering the tags automatically suggested by the classifier. This might be used, for example, by an attacker who is willing to avoid the automatic detection of improper material in a parental control system. More specifically, we show that it is possible to modify an image in order to have it associated to the wrong class, without perceptually affecting the image visual quality. The proposed method is validated against a well known image dataset, and results prove to be promising, highlighting the need to jointly study the problem from the standpoint of both the analyst and the attacker.},

abstract={With the growing popularity of cloud computing, the exploitation of possible vulnerabilities grows at the same pace; the distributed nature of the cloud makes it an attractive target for potential intruders. Despite security issues delaying its adoption, cloud computing has already become an unstoppable force; thus, security mechanisms to ensure its secure adoption are an immediate need. Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels. Then, we review its components and discuss some existing approaches to be used for the modules in our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss developing a comprehensive trust management framework to support the establishment and evolution of trust among different cloud service providers.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel method of label propagation for one-class learning. For binary (positive/negative) classification, the proposed method simultaneously measures the pair-wise similarity between samples and the negativity at every sample based on a cone-based model of local neighborhoods. Relying only on positive labeled samples as in one-class learning, the method estimates the labels of unlabeled samples via label propagation using the similarities and the negativities in the framework of semi-supervised learning. In the proposed method, unlike standard label propagation methods, it is not necessary to prepare negative labeled samples since the measured negativity works as an alternative of such labeling negative samples. In experiments on target detection in still images and motion images, the proposed method exhibits the favorable performances compared to the other methods.},

abstract={Attack traceability and attribution are two of the main tasks of IT forensics. To support this, IT forensics is not limited to investigate data after the attack has taken place. Already before the attack, an optimal environment for a subsequent investigation has to be created. While this is primarily focused on ordinary logging, we propose to set both degree and characteristics of logging, based on geolocation. Thus, for conspicuous locations, more knowledge is gathered and stored in advance (georeputation). Next to this, due to the fact that the distribution of IP addresses is not static, additional information is stored to, e.g., determine the Internet service provider, which was responsible for the IP at the time the crime was committed. This additional data also contains geoinformation that can be used later to reconstruct attack routes and to identify and analyze distributed attacks. For these purposes, however, the IP localization mechanisms, i.e., the underlying method for geolocation, must be very accurate. Therefore, next to highlighting, the benefits of including geobased information and providing our architecture in order to do so, this publication also investigates accuracy and reliability of geoinformation and provides its own geolocation architecture and a corresponding prototype, including an evaluation.},

abstract={Mobile social networks (MSNs) are specific types of social media which consolidate the ability of omnipresent connection for mobile users/devices to share user-centric data objects among interested users. Taking advantage of the characteristics of both social networks and opportunistic networks (OppNets), MSNs are capable of providing an efficient and effective mobile environment for users to access, share, and distribute data. However, the lack of a protective infrastructure in these networks has turned them into convenient targets for various perils. This is the main impulse why MSNs carry disparate and intricate safety concerns and embrace divergent safety challenging problems. In this paper, we aim to provide a clear categorization on safety challenges and a deep exploration over some recent solutions in MSNs. This work narrows the safety challenges and solution techniques down from OppNets and delay-tolerant networks to MSNs with the hope of covering all the work proposed around security, privacy, and trust in MSNs. To conclude, several major open research issues are discussed, and future research directions are outlined.},

abstract={As a deep learning-based application, DeepFake can generate malicious images or videos through replacing the face of a source image with the target face, which poses a significant threat to social media. In this paper, we propose a scheme to prevent such tampering by exploring adversarial examples against DeepFake. Specifically, adversarial examples are produced by adding tailored distortion to source images. The added distortion is imperceptible to human vision but can mislead the generation of face-swapped images effectively. We present three novel adversarial attacks against DeepFake autoencoders from perspectives of adversarial transferability and latent representation. Our first method synthesizes universal perturbation, which is image-agnostic. By contrast, the latter two methods directly perform the preciser perturbation specific to a source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial examples against DeepFake in terms of both reference and non-reference image quality assessment.},

volume={16},
number={},
pages={2727-2742},
abstract={In this paper, beam-domain (BD) anti-jamming transmission in a downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is investigated. A smart jammer with multiple antennas attempts to interfere with the signal reception of users with the desired energy efficiency (EE), whereas a base station (BS) tries to minimize the transmission cost while ensuring uninterrupted communication. A Bayesian Stackelberg game between the BS and jammer, where the jammer is the follower and the BS acts as the leader, is modeled. In the follower subgame, the optimal jamming precoding with a closed-form power solution is introduced. The optimal jamming power is proportional to the transmission power in the downlink, and thus, for the BS, the strategy of suppressing malicious attacks by increasing the transmission power fails. In the leader subgame, generalized zero-forcing (ZF), whose closed-form power solution constitutes the unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) with that of the jammer, is found to be the optimal anti-jamming precoding for robust transmission. The results show that there always exists a precoding solution for the BS that ensures reliable transmission when the SE is obtained. A proper increase in the minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) threshold or the BD channel approximation error helps the BS save power during the resistance against the jammer. Then, a simplified power solution without the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of jamming channels is further introduced for practical implementation. Numerical results are provided to verify the proposed solutions.},

abstract={We propose a new authentication factor based on network round trip time ( $\rm {NRTT}$). We show how $\rm {NRTT}$ can be used to uniquely and securely identify login locations and hence can support location-based web authentication mechanisms. The first research challenge is how to securely measure and verify $\rm {NRTT}$ to hamper potential forgery attempts. We address the first challenge by introducing a novel forwarding device in the path between the server and the client, dubbed delay mask (DM), which prevents any entity, but the server, from being able to measure the $\rm {NRTT}$ for any client. The second research challenge is how to reliably measure $\rm {NRTT}$ in the face of variable Internet latencies and connectivity conditions. The second challenge is addressed by: first, computing the average of a number of $\rm {NRTT}$ measurements after outlier removal; and second, applying multiple profiles per user through the deployment of multiple DMs in diverse geographical locations. We design a two-factor authentication scheme (dubbed AMAN) that uses legacy passwords as a first factor and $\rm {NRTT}$ as a second authentication factor. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate security-usability-deployability properties of AMAN and compare it with the state-of-the-art authentication mechanisms. The results show that AMAN achieves the best combination of these properties.},

abstract={Recently, massive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has accelerated digital transformation of modern society in various aspects. Naturally, how to ensure security of deployed IoT devices has become an important and practical issue. Several successful large-scale DDoS attacks were utilized vulnerabilities of firmware on IoT devices in the past couple of years. Therefore, effective and efficient firmware update solution on IoT devices is in demand. In this study, an automatic real-time firmware update framework based on blockchain technology and MQTT protocol is proposed. To support automatic real-time firmware update operation on deployed IoT devices, multiple MQTT servers are installed in corresponding blockchain nodes to execute firmware patch delivery operation by the design of our framework. Blockchain technology is used to record the original manufacturer of a published firmware patch for a dedicated IoT device and smart contract is adopted to discover MQTT service nodes in a blockchain network. Data integrity of a newly generated firmware patch is preserved by distributing the patch with its hashed value. A framework prototype is constructed and experiments are conducted. Based on the experimental results, the proposed framework can efficiently and securely deliver firmware patches to targeted gateways in real-time scale.},

abstract={Several organizations are utilizing cloud technologies and resources to run a range of applications. These services help businesses save on hardware management, scalability and maintainability concerns of underlying infrastructure. Key cloud service providers (CSPs) like Amazon, Microsoft and Google offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to meet the growing demand of such enterprises. This increased utilization of cloud platforms has made it an attractive target to the attackers, thereby, making the security of cloud services a top priority for CSPs. In this respect, malware has been recognized as one of the most dangerous and destructive threats to cloud infrastructure (IaaS). In this paper, we study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based deep learning techniques for detecting malware in cloud Virtual Machines (VMs). We focus on two major RNN architectures: Long Short Term Memory RNNs (LSTMs) and Bidirectional RNNs (BIDIs). These models learn the behavior of malware over time based on run-time fine-grained processes system features such as CPU, memory, and disk utilization. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 40,680 malicious and benign samples. The process level features were collected using real malware running in an open online cloud environment with no restrictions, which is important to emulate practical cloud provider settings and also capture the true behaviour of stealth and sophisticated malware. Both our LSTM and BIDI models achieve high detection rates over 99% for different evaluation metrics. In addition, an analysis study is conducted to understand the significance of input data representations. Our results suggest that in particular cases, input ordering does have some affect on the performance of the trained RNN models.},

While there are many works analyzing the transitions involved in walking, very few works analyze human motion where more complex supports occur. In this work, we analyze complex support pose transitions in human motion involving locomotion and manipulation tasks (loco-manipulation). We have applied a method for the detection of human support contacts from motion capture data to a large-scale dataset of loco-manipulation motions involving multi-contact supports, providing a semantic representation of them. Our results provide a statistical analysis of the used support poses, their transitions and the time spent in each of them. In addition, our data partially validates our taxonomy of whole-body support poses presented in our previous work. We believe that this work extends our understanding of human motion for humanoids, with a long-term objective of developing methods for autonomous multi-contact motion planning.},

abstract={In this ubiquitous IoT (Internet of Things) era, web services have become a vital part of today's critical national and public sector infrastructure. With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges. Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities. The paper reviews the security issues targeting web services, software/program verification and security development lifecycle.},

Traditional risk assessment methodologies, however, cannot be effectively applied in the IoMT context since IoMT devices form part of a distributed and trustless environment and naturally support functionalities that favor reliability and usability instead of security. In this work we present a survey of risk assessment and mitigation methodologies for IoMT. For conducting the survey, we assess two streams of literature. First, we systematically review and classify the current scientific research in IoMT risk assessment methodologies. Second, we review existing standards/best practices for IoMT security assessment and mitigation in order to i) provide a comparative assessment of these standards/best practices on the basis of predefined criteria (scope and/or coverage, maturity level, and relevant risk methodology applied) and ii) identify common themes for IoMT security controls. Based on the analysis, we provide various IoMT research and implementation gaps along with a road map of fruitful areas for future research. The paper could be of significant value to security assessment researchers and policymakers/stakeholders in the health care industry.},

abstract={With the development of autonomous malware and autonomous anti-malware, command and control of cyber weapons is becoming an important part of cyber defence. In the present paper we discuss the dangers of deploying and controlling intelligent cyber weapons in a unified setting, considering these weapons as intelligent agents. Command and control of intelligent agents causes new threats that are difficult to avoid due to the complexity of behaviour of agents. Situation awareness of agents must be improved and verified, or at least carefully tested with respect to safety of their behaviour. Several possible dangerous behaviours of cyber weapons are discussed in the talk: misunderstanding of a situation, misinterpretation of commands, and loss of contact and formation of unwanted coalitions. A specific threat is the formation of unwanted coalitions by proactive weapons. This can happen if they get too much autonomy in decision making. A scenario of insubordination of agents is presented, considering a longer time perspective. General conclusions are the following: the more intelligent software becomes the more difficult it will be to control it; when designing and developing new cyber weapons, one has to guarantee the appropriate control over these weapons under any circumstances. It is practically impossible to use formal methods for verifying the safety of intelligent cyber weapons for their users. Setting strict constraints on the behaviour of cyber weapons and their careful testing are necessary.},

abstract={Referer is a HTTP header field transmitted to a webserver, which allows the webserver to identify the origin of the request and the path taken by the visiting user to reach the final resource. Although referer is an optional field within an HTTP protocol header, many webservers use the information for logging, marketing and analytical purposes. Referer has, however, been abused in web spam cloaking and search engine optimization (SEO) attacks. The latter increases a malicious website's ranking in a search engine result with the aims of delivering spam to unwitting users. In this paper, we undertake a quantitative study to determine the effects of referer information on delivery of malicious content (excluding spam) and whether different referer values, mimicking an average user will yield dissimilar results in terms of the number and type of attacks. Our study of 500,000 suspicious websites confirms that similar to web spam, referer information is a HTTP header variable used by malicious websites to distinguish regular users from automated crawlers and security tools, and is abused to deliver malicious content accordingly.},

pages={21881-21894},
abstract={Moving Target Defense (MTD) is an emerging proactive Cyber Security approach. MTD constantly changes the attack surface for making cyber-attacks difficult for the invaders. Software Defined Networking(SDN) provides dynamic network design capabilities with its centralized control plane. In this paper, SMCDS (SDN based Moving Target Defense for control and data planes Security) has been proposed. The SMCDS framework safeguards against the reconnaissance attacks targeted at both data and control planes. The concept of distributed shadow controllers is introduced for securing the control plane. The MTD effect is created through the use of shadow controllers that respond to the malicious probing traffic in place of the actual controller. The availability of the distributed control plane is enhanced through the used of these shadow controllers as well. The proposed framework adopts the reactive and proactive approaches for securing the servers connected at the data plane. The reactive approach capitalizes the technique of shadow servers for providing defense against reconnaissance attacks. The proactive approach provides security enhancement through the technique of IP and port shuffling. The novelty of SMCDS framework is its capability to provide protection of both data and control planes by exploiting SDN based MTD approach. The SMCDS framework was evaluated in terms of the attacker effort, defender cost. From the results, it can be observed that the proposed framework provides security against reconnaissance attacks at a low computational cost. The prototype of the proposed SMCDS was implemented using Mininet emulator and ONOS controller.},

abstract={The problem of Big Data in cyber security (i.e., too much network data to analyze) compounds itself every day. Our approach is based on a fundamental characteristic of Big Data: an overwhelming majority of the network traffic in a traditionally secured enterprise (i.e., using defense-in-depth) is non-malicious. Therefore, one way of eliminating the Big Data problem in cyber security is to ignore the overwhelming majority of an enterprise's non-malicious network traffic and focus only on the smaller amounts of suspicious or malicious network traffic. Our approach uses simple clustering along with a dataset enriched with known malicious domains (i.e., anchors) to accurately and quickly filter out the non-suspicious network traffic. Our algorithm has demonstrated the predictive ability to accurately filter out approximately 97% (depending on the algorithm used) of the non-malicious data in millions of Domain Name Service (DNS) queries in minutes and identify the small percentage of unseen suspicious network traffic. We demonstrate that the resulting network traffic can be analyzed with traditional reputation systems, blacklists, or in-house threat tracking sources (we used virustotal.com) to identify harmful domains that are being accessed from within the enterprise network. Specifically, our results show that the method can reduce a dataset of 400k query-answer domains (with complete malicious domain ground truth) down to only 3% containing 99% of all malicious domains. Further, we demonstrate that this capability scales to 10 million query-answer pairs, which it can reduce by 97% in less than an hour.},

The model is hybrid approach of symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography algorithms. In this Data Encryption Standard (DES) and RSA are implemented to provide the multilevel of encryption and decryption at both sender and receiver side which increase the security of the cloud storage. This security model gives the transparency to the cloud user as well as cloud service provider in order to reduce the security threats.

abstract={With the ever-increasing reliance on data for data-driven applications in power grids, such as event cause analysis, the authenticity of data streams has become crucially important. The data can be prone to adversarial stealthy attacks aiming to manipulate the data such that residual-based bad data detectors cannot detect them, and the perception of system operators or event classifiers changes about the actual event. This paper investigates the impact of adversarial attacks on convolutional neural network-based event cause analysis frameworks. We have successfully verified the ability of adversaries to maliciously misclassify events through stealthy data manipulations. The vulnerability assessment is studied with respect to the number of compromised measurements. Furthermore, a defense mechanism to robustify the performance of the event cause analysis is proposed. The effectiveness of adversarial attacks on changing the output of the framework is studied using the data generated by real-time digital simulator (RTDS) under different scenarios such as type of attacks and level of access to data.},

However, there are no effective defensive methods to enhance the fault-tolerance capability of DNN against such BFA. In this work, we conduct comprehensive investigations on BFA and propose to leverage binarization-aware training and its relaxation - piece-wise clustering as simple and effective countermeasures to BFA. The experiments show that, for BFA to achieve the identical prediction accuracy degradation (e.g., below 11% on CIFAR-10), it requires 19.3× and 480.1× more effective malicious bit-flips on ResNet-20 and VGG-11 respectively, compared to defend-free counterparts.},

abstract={Adversarial examples have emerged as a significant threat to machine learning algorithms, especially to the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose two quantization-based defense mechanisms, Constant Quantization (CQ) and Trainable Quantization (TQ), to increase the robustness of CNNs against adversarial examples. CQ quantizes input pixel intensities based on a “fixed” number of quantization levels, while in TQ, the quantization levels are “iteratively learned during the training phase”, thereby providing a stronger defense mechanism. We apply the proposed techniques on undefended CNNs against different state-of-the-art adversarial attacks from the open-source Cleverhans library. The experimental results demonstrate 50%-96% and 10%-50% increase in the classification accuracy of the perturbed images generated from the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, on commonly used CNN (Conv2D(64, 8×8)-Conv2D(128, 6×6)-Conv2D(128, 5×5) - Dense(10) - Softmax()) available in Cleverhans library.},

abstract={AI means are widely used to detect correlations in large data sets. This makes them an ideal candidate to improve side channel analysis attacks as the core feature if these attacks is to reveal the correlation between measurement values and the key bits processed. In this paper we present an assessment of AI means, i.e. k-means. We investigated the success rate of attacks against three designs with different levels of vulnerability. The result was that even though counter intuitive approaches such as the Pearson correlation coefficient outperform k-means. The highest success rate of the latter was 68.7 per cent of an uncompressed trace and 88.3 per cent for a compressed trace whereas the Pearson correlation coefficient achieved 91.7 per cent for the uncompressed trace and 89.3 per cent for the compressed trace.},

abstract={Fog computing, a novel computing paradigm, migrates cloud computing to the edge of network and consequently decrease the overhead of process and movement of the large-scale big data. Fog computing is promising to lower communication delay and offload network traffic with the scale of big data increasing in large-scale IoT application, which brings micro-data centers to the network edge, enabling the network edge to perceive, process, storage and calculate the massive data, reducing the amount of transferred data. However, numerous fog nodes at the network edge face an external attack resulting in serious security threats arising from the trusting relationship vulnerability because of the lack of the consideration of the properties of the fog computing system. This paper addresses the design for developing secure distributed data management platform for fog computing in large-scale IoT application, along with a blockchain-based data management implementation of the platform, which approaches the major challenges: how to realize the integration of data security and storage management for fog computing in large-scale IoT application and enrich rational interoperability for interconnected things. Experimental results show that the system works well to empower data provenance and transparency and defend against unauthorized access effectively in fog computing, scales well with loss of the performance of communication and computing maintaining in acceptable range, verifying the efficiency and feasibility of our design to provide privacy, integrity and fine-grained data management for fog computing in large-scale IoT application by introducing the data management platform based upon the blockchain network and smart contracts therein.},

abstract={Set-valued data and social network provide opportunities to mine useful, yet potentially security-sensitive, information. While there are mechanisms to anonymize data and protect the privacy separately in set-valued data and in social network, the existing approaches in data privacy do not address the privacy issue which emerge when publishing set-valued data and its correlative social network simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a privacy attack model based on linking the set-valued data and the social network topology information and a novel technique to defend against such attack to protect the individual privacy. To improve data utility and the practicality of our scheme, we use local generalization and partial suppression to make set-valued data satisfy the grouped ρ-uncertainty model and to reduce the impact on the community structure of the social network when anonymizing the social network. Experiments on real-life data sets show that our method outperforms the existing mechanisms in data privacy and, more specifically, that it provides greater data utility while having less impact on the community structure of social networks.},

abstract={Localisation is of importance for many applications. Our motivating scenarios are short-term construction work and emergency rescue. Not only is accuracy necessary, these scenarios also require rapid setup and robustness to environmental conditions. These requirements preclude the use of many traditional methods e.g. vision-based, laser-based, Ultra-wide band (UWB) and Global Positioning System (GPS)-based localisation systems. To solve these challenges, we introduce iMag, an accurate and rapidly deployable inertial magneto-inductive (MI) localisation system. It localises monitored workers using a single MI transmitter and inertial measurement units with minimal setup effort. However, MI location estimates can be distorted and ambiguous. To solve this problem, we suggest a novel method to use MI devices for sensing environmental distortions, and use these to correctly close inertial loops. By applying robust simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM), our proposed localisation method achieves excellent tracking accuracy, and can improve performance significantly compared with only using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and MI device for localisation.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={522-531},
abstract={With the recent rise of HTTPS adoption on the Web, attackers have begun "HTTPSifying" phishing websites. HTTPSifying a phishing website has the advantage of making the website appear legitimate and evading conventional detection methods that leverage URLs or web contents in the network. Further, adopting HTTPS could also contribute to generating intrinsic footprints and provide defenders with a great opportunity to monitor and detect websites, including phishing sites, as they would need to obtain a public-key certificate issued for the preparation of the websites. The potential benefits of certificate-based detection include: (1) the comprehensive monitoring of all HTTPSified websites by using certificates immediately after their issuance, even if the attacker utilizes dynamic DNS (DDNS) or hosting services; this could be overlooked with the conventional domain-registration-based approaches; and (2) to detect phishing websites before they are published on the Internet. Accordingly, we address the following research question: How can we make use of the footprints of TLS certificates to defend against phishing attacks? For this, we collected a large set of TLS certificates corresponding to phishing websites from Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and extensively analyzed these TLS certificates. We demonstrated that a template of common names, which are equivalent to the fully qualified domain names, obtained through the clustering analysis of the certificates can be used for the following promising applications: (1) The discovery of previously unknown phishing websites with low false positives and (2) understanding the infrastructure used to generate the phishing websites. We use our findings on the abuse of free certificate authorities (CAs) for operating HTTPSified phishing websites to discuss possible solutions against such abuse and provide a recommendation to the CAs.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) is regarded as an emerging technology, which equips wireless devices with the capability to adapt their operating parameters on the fly based on the radio environment, to utilize the scarce radio frequency spectrum in an efficient and opportunistic manner. However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart wireless devices in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), CR systems are vulnerable to numerous security threats that affect the overall performance. There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables. We also present recommendations that can be followed while implementing countermeasures to enhance CRN security. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of CRN security attacks and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this area.},

abstract={Autonomous vehicle is becoming a complex cyber-physical system with many interfaces to the external world like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and vehicle to anything (v2x) networks. These interfaces open new attack surfaces that can put the onboard sensors used in autonomous driving at risk of internal and external cyber-attacks that are capable of manipulating the sensor data. Since the control algorithms that define the autonomous vehicle behavior rely on the data from these onboard sensors like LiDAR, camera and RADAR, failure to secure the sensor data could lead to erroneous decisions and may result in fatal accidents. In this paper, we propose a 3D QIM based data- hiding technique to secure the raw data from LiDAR sensor. The proposed technique detects the tampering of the LiDAR sensor data and also locates the tampered region. The evaluation of the proposed method on KITTI dataset showed that the method can successfully detect and localize insider data tampering attacks such as fake target insertion (FTI) and valid target deletion (VTD).},

abstract={Smart home IoT devices have been more prevalent than ever before but the relevant security considerations fail to keep up with due to device and technology heterogeneity and resource constraints, making IoT systems susceptible to various attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based mechanism to identify the vulnerabilities in communication of IoT devices for smart home systems. Our approach takes one or more packet capture files as inputs to construct a traffic graph by passing the captured messages, identify the correlated subgraphs by examining the attribute-value pairs associated with each message, and then quantify their vulnerabilities based on the sensitivity levels of different keywords. To test the effectiveness of our approach, we setup a smart home system that can control a smart bulb LB100 via either the smartphone APP for LB100 or the Google Home speaker. We collected and analyzed 58,714 messages and exploited 6 vulnerable correlated sub graphs, based on which we implemented 6 attack cases that can be easily reproduced by attackers with little knowledge of IoT. This study is novel as our approach takes only the collected traffic files as inputs without requiring the knowledge of the device firmware while being able to identify new vulnerabilities. With this approach, we won the third prize out of 20 teams in a hacking competition.},

abstract={Hardware design, especially the very large scale integration(VLSI) and systems on chip design(SOC), utilizes many codes from third-party intellectual property (IP) providers and former designers. Hardware Trojans (HTs) are easily inserted in this process. Recently researchers have proposed many HTs detection techniques targeting the design codes. State-of-art detections are based on the testability including Controllability and Observability, which are effective to all HTs from TrustHub, and advanced HTs like DeTrust. Meanwhile, testability based detections have advantages in the timing complexity and can be easily integrated into recently industrial verification. Undoubtedly, the adversaries will upgrade their designs accordingly to evade these detection techniques. Designing a variety of complex trojans is a significant way to perfect the existing detection, therefore, we present a novel design of HTs to defeat the testability based detection methods, namely DeTest. Our approach is simple and straight forward, yet it proves to be effective at adding some logic. Without changing HTs malicious function, DeTest decreases controllability and observability values to about 10% of the original, which invalidates distinguishers like clustering and support vector machines (SVM). As shown in our practical attack results, adversaries can easily use DeTest to upgrade their HTs to evade testability based detections. Combined with advanced HTs design techniques like DeTrust, DeTest can evade previous detecions, like UCI, VeriTrust and FANCI. We further discuss how to extend existing solutions to reduce the threat posed by DeTest.},

abstract={Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to their application in security sensitive systems. We propose a Denoiser and UPsampler Network (DUP-Net) structure as defenses for 3D adversarial point cloud classification, where the two modules reconstruct surface smoothness by dropping or adding points. In this paper, statistical outlier removal (SOR) and a data-driven upsampling network are considered as denoiser and upsampler respectively. Compared with baseline defenses, DUP-Net has three advantages. First, with DUP-Net as a defense, the target model is more robust to white-box adversarial attacks. Second, the statistical outlier removal provides added robustness since it is a non-differentiable denoising operation. Third, the upsampler network can be trained on a small dataset and defends well against adversarial attacks generated from other point cloud datasets. We conduct various experiments to validate that DUP-Net is very effective as defense in practice. Our best defense eliminates 83.8% of C&W and l2 loss based attack (point shifting), 50.0% of C&W and Hausdorff distance loss based attack (point adding) and 9.0% of saliency map based attack (point dropping) under 200 dropped points on PointNet.},

abstract={Despite the best efforts of cyber security analysts, networked computing assets are routinely compromised, resulting in the loss of intellectual property, the disclosure of state secrets, and major financial damages. Anomaly detection methods are beneficial for detecting new types of attacks and abnormal network activity, but such algorithms can be difficult to understand and trust. Network operators and cyber analysts need fast and scalable tools to help identify suspicious behavior that bypasses automated security systems, but operators do not want another automated tool with algorithms they do not trust. Experts need tools to augment their own domain expertise and to provide a contextual understanding of suspicious behavior to help them make decisions. In this paper we present Situ, a visual analytics system for discovering suspicious behavior in streaming network data. Situ provides a scalable solution that combines anomaly detection with information visualization. The system's visualizations enable operators to identify and investigate the most anomalous events and IP addresses, and the tool provides context to help operators understand why they are anomalous. Finally, operators need tools that can be integrated into their workflow and with their existing tools. This paper describes the Situ platform and its deployment in an operational network setting. We discuss how operators are currently using the tool in a large organization's security operations center and present the results of expert reviews with professionals.},

abstract={Visual place recognition is a challenging problem due to the vast range of ways in which the appearance of real-world places can vary. In recent years, improvements in visual sensing capabilities, an ever-increasing focus on long-term mobile robot autonomy, and the ability to draw on state-of-the-art research in other disciplines-particularly recognition in computer vision and animal navigation in neuroscience-have all contributed to significant advances in visual place recognition systems. This paper presents a survey of the visual place recognition research landscape. We start by introducing the concepts behind place recognition-the role of place recognition in the animal kingdom, how a “place” is defined in a robotics context, and the major components of a place recognition system. Long-term robot operations have revealed that changing appearance can be a significant factor in visual place recognition failure; therefore, we discuss how place recognition solutions can implicitly or explicitly account for appearance change within the environment. Finally, we close with a discussion on the future of visual place recognition, in particular with respect to the rapid advances being made in the related fields of deep learning, semantic scene understanding, and video description.},

abstract={This paper presents the implementation of a coordinated decision-making agent for emergency response scenarios. The agent’s implementation uses reinforcement learning (RL). RL is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn from experimenting. The agent’s learning is based on rewards, and feedback signals proportional to how good its actions are. The simulation platform used was infrastructure interdependencies simulator, in which, we have tested suitability of the approach in previous studies. In this paper, we have added new features to our previous solution, for enabling faster convergence and distributed processing. These additions include an enhanced reward scheme and a scheduler for orchestrating the distributed training. We include two test cases. The first case is a compact model with four critical infrastructures. In this model, the agent’s training required only 10% of the attempts needed in our previous version. Improvements in convergence come from adding a shaping reward scheme. We trained the agent across 24 simultaneous configurations of our model. The training process elapsed 4 min. The extended case included more infrastructures and a higher level of detail. The dimensionality of the problem grew by a factor of 4000, but the training converged in less episodes. We tested the extended model over 96 parallel instances (potential scenarios) with completion in 2.87 min. The results show a fast and stable convergence. This agent can help during multiple stages of emergency response including real-time situations.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are getting more and more popular in recent years and IoT networks play an important role in the industry as well as people's activities. On the one hand, they bring convenience to every aspect of our daily life; on the other hand, they are vulnerable to various attacks that in turn cancels out their benefits to a certain degree. In this article, we target the defense techniques against IoT Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and propose an edge-centric IoT defense scheme termed FlowGuard for the detection, identification, classification, and mitigation of IoT DDoS attacks. We present a new DDoS attack detection algorithm based on traffic variations and design two machine learning models for DDoS identification and classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the two machine learning models, we generate a large data set by DDoS simulators BoNeSi and SlowHTTPTest, and combine it with the CICDDoS2019 data set, to test the identification and classification accuracy as well as the model efficiency. Our results indicate that the identification accuracy of the proposed long short-term memory is as high as 98.9%, which significantly outperforms the other four well-known learning models mentioned in the most related work. The classification accuracy of the proposed convolutional neural network is up to 99.9%. Besides, our models satisfactorily meet the delay requirements of IoT when deployed in edge servers with computational powers higher than a personal computer.},

abstract={Security provisioning has become a key issue in wireless multimedia networks due to their vital roles in supporting various services. Conventional security solutions have deficiencies in computing efficiency and addressing emerging security challenges. In addition, traditional upper-layer authentication ignores the protection of the physical layer, leading to severe privacy data leakage. In this paper, we envision a new deep learning (DL)-enabled security authentication scheme to overcome these issues, while implementing Blind Feature Learning (BFL) and Lightweight Physical Layer Authentication (LPLA). Specifically, an intelligent authentication method is developed by exploring neural networks at the data collection unit to learn the characteristics of data. Then we propose a holistic authentication scheme based on machine learning to identify malicious multimedia devices. Experimental analysis verifies that the proposed scheme can guarantee the privacy of wireless multimedia sensors and achieve lightweight authentication. Performance results indicate that artificial intelligence-enabled authentication scheme improves the overall security of multimedia networks.},

abstract={Most of the existing mobile application (app) vetting mechanisms only estimate risks at a coarse-grained level by analyzing app syntax but not semantics. We propose a semantics-aware privacy risk assessment framework (SPRisk), which considers the sensitivity discrepancy of privacy-related factors at semantic level. Our framework can provide qualitative (i.e., risk level) and quantitative (i.e., risk score) assessment results, both of which help users make decisions to install an app or not. Furthermore, to find the reasonable weight distribution of each factor automatically, we exploit a self-learning weight assignment method, which is based on fuzzy clustering and knowledge dependency theory. We implement a prototype system and evaluate the effectiveness of SPRisk with 192,445 normal apps and 7,111 malicious apps. A measurement study further reveals some interesting findings, such as the privacy risk distribution of Google Play Store, the diversity of official and unofficial marketplaces, which provide insights into understanding the seriousness of privacy threat in the Android ecosystem.},

In our problem formulation, to correct the accumulated drift of the Lidar-only odometry we apply a place recognition method to detect geometrically similar locations between the online 3D point cloud and the a priori offline map. In the proposed system, we integrate a state-of-the-art Lidaronly odometry algorithm with a recently proposed 3D point segment matching method by complementing their advantages. Also, we propose additional enhancements in order to reduce the number of false matches between the online point cloud and the target map, and to refine the position estimation error whenever a good match is detected. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed LOL system on several Kitti datasets of different lengths and environments, where the relocalization accuracy and the precision of the vehicle's trajectory were significantly improved in every case, while still being able to maintain real-time performance.},

abstract={With more regulations tackling the protection of users’ privacy-sensitive data in recent years, access to such data has become increasingly restricted. A new decentralized training paradigm, known as Federated Learning (FL), enables multiple clients located at different geographical locations to learn a machine learning model collaboratively without sharing their data. While FL has recently emerged as a promising solution to preserve users’ privacy, this new paradigm’s potential security implications may hinder its widespread adoption. The existing FL protocols exhibit new unique vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit to compromise the trained model. FL is often preferred in learning environments where security and privacy are the key concerns. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness of the consequences resulting from the new threats to FL systems. To date, the security of traditional machine learning systems has been widely examined. However, many open challenges and complex questions are still surrounding FL security. In this paper, we bridge the gap in FL literature by providing a comprehensive survey of the unique security vulnerabilities exposed by the FL ecosystem. We highlight the vulnerabilities sources, key attacks on FL, defenses, as well as their unique challenges, and discuss promising future research directions towards more robust FL.},

abstract={Observed social networks are often considered as proxies for underlying social networks. The analysis of observed networks oftentimes involves the identification of influential nodes via various centrality metrics. Our work is motivated by recent research on the investigation and design of adversarial attacks on machine learning systems. We apply the concept of adversarial attacks to social networks by studying strategies by which an adversary can minimally perturb the observed network structure to achieve their target function of modifying the ranking of nodes according to centrality measures. This can represent the attempts of an adversary to boost or demote the degree to which others perceive them as influential or powerful. It also allows us to study the impact of adversarial attacks on targets and victims, and to design metrics and security measures that help to identify and mitigate adversarial network attacks. We conduct a series of experiments on synthetic network data to identify attacks that allow the adversarial node to achieve their objective with a single move. We test this approach on different common network topologies and for common centrality metrics. We find that there is a small set of moves that result in the adversary achieving their objective, and this set is smaller for decreasing centrality metrics than for increasing them. These results can help with assessing the robustness of centrality measures. The notion of changing social network data to yield adversarial outcomes has practical implications, e.g., for information diffusion on social media, influence and power dynamics in social systems, and improving network security.},

Detection of adversarial examples is, therefore, a fundamental requirement for robust classification frameworks. In this work, we present a method for detecting such adversarial attacks, which is suitable for any pre-trained neural network classifier. We use influence functions to measure the impact of every training sample on the validation set data. From the influence scores, we find the most supportive training samples for any given validation example. A k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model fitted on the DNN's activation layers is employed to search for the ranking of these supporting training samples. We observe that these samples are highly correlated with the nearest neighbors of the normal inputs, while this correlation is much weaker for adversarial inputs. We train an adversarial detector using the k-NN ranks and distances and show that it successfully distinguishes adversarial examples, getting state-of-the-art results on six attack methods with three datasets.

abstract={Forecasting the motion of surrounding obstacles (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and etc.) benefits the on-road motion planning for intelligent and autonomous vehicles. Complex scenes always yield great challenges in modeling the patterns of surrounding traffic. For example, one main challenge comes from the intractable interaction effects in a complex traffic system. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer architecture Interaction-aware Kalman Neural Networks (IaKNN) which involves an interaction layer for resolving high-dimensional traffic environmental observations as interaction-aware accelerations, a motion layer for transforming the accelerations to interaction-aware trajectories, and a filter layer for estimating future trajectories with a Kalman filter network. Attributed to the multiple traffic data sources, our end-to-end trainable approach technically fuses dynamic and interaction-aware trajectories boosting the prediction performance. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that IaKNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness for traffic trajectory prediction.},

As the primary contribution, we demonstrate how to construct surrogate datasets, using images from GAN generators, labelled with a classifier trained on the private dataset. Next, we show this surrogate data can further be used for a variety of downstream tasks (here classification and regression), while being resistant to membership attacks.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) provides applications and services that would otherwise not be possible. However, the open nature of IoT makes it vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Especially, identity spoofing attacks, where an adversary passively listens to the existing radio communications and then mimic the identity of legitimate devices to conduct malicious activities. Existing solutions employ cryptographic signatures to verify the trustworthiness of received information. In prevalent IoT, secret keys for cryptography can potentially be disclosed and disable the verification mechanism. Noncryptographic device verification is needed to ensure trustworthy IoT. In this article, we propose an enhanced deep learning framework for IoT device identification using physical-layer signals. Specifically, we enable our framework to report unseen IoT devices and introduce the zero-bias layer to deep neural networks to increase robustness and interpretability. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real data from automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), an application of IoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to the accurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and services.},

abstract={Security exploits and ensuant malware pose an increasing challenge to computing systems as the variety and complexity of attacks continue to increase. In response, software-based malware detection tools have grown in complexity, thus making it computationally difficult to use them to protect systems in real-time. Therefore, software detectors are applied selectively and at a low frequency, creating opportunities for malware to remain undetected. In this paper, we propose Malware-Aware Processors (MAP) - processors augmented with an online hardware-based detector to serve as the first line of defense to differentiate malware from legitimate programs. The output of this detector helps the system prioritize how to apply more expensive software-based solutions. The always-on nature of MAP detector helps protect against intermittently operating malware. Our work improves on the state of the art in the following ways: (1) We define and explore the use of sub-semantic features for online detection of malware. (2) We explore hardware implementations and show that simple classifiers appropriate for such implementations can effectively classify malware. We also study different classifiers, develop implementation optimizations, and explore complexity to performance trade-offs. (3) We propose a two-level detection framework where the hardware classifier prioritizes the work of a more accurate but more expensive software defense mechanism. (4) We integrate the MAP implementation with an open-source x86-compatible core, synthesizing the resulting design to run on an FPGA.},

abstract={In recent years, more and more mobile applications adopt deep learning technologies, especially CNN-based image recognition. To protect service providers' interests, the CNN models are usually deployed on the cloud, and the users are required to upload raw images, which cause serious privacy concerns since images may contain sensitive information unrelated to the desired recognition tasks. The previous solution off-loads the shallow portions of the CNN to the clients, and thus the uploaded data becomes the extracted lower-level features rather than the raw images. Nevertheless, although service providers are prevented from obtaining the original images, it is still probably for them to perform some sensitive recognition tasks other than the desired one on the lower-lever features (even after being perturbed to satisfy Differential Privacy). Different from such solution, in this paper, we propose an independent local CNN, which is dedicated for the image perturbation on the clients. It is co-trained with the cloud CNN to learn to intelligently allocate diverse noises among pixels depending on their significance to the desired recognition service. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our mechanism can well prevent curious service providers from performing undesired recognition tasks while maintaining the high accuracy of the desired one.},

abstract={The last decade has witnessed remarkable research advances at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and hardware security. The confluence of the two technologies has created many interesting and unique opportunities, but also left some issues in their wake. ML schemes have been extensively used to enhance the security and trust of embedded systems like hardware Trojans and malware detection. On the other hand, ML-based approaches have also been adopted by adversaries to assist side-channel attacks, reverse engineer integrated circuits and break hardware security primitives like Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Deep learning is a subfield of ML. It can continuously learn from a large amount of labeled data with a layered structure. Despite the impressive outcomes demonstrated by deep learning in many application scenarios, the dark side of it has not been fully exposed yet. The inability to fully understand and explain what has been done within the super-intelligence can turn an inherently benevolent system into malevolent. Recent research has revealed that the outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be easily corrupted by imperceptibly small input perturbations. As computations are brought nearer to the source of data creation, the attack surface of DNN has also been extended from the input data to the edge devices. Accordingly, due to the opportunities of ML-assisted security and the vulnerabilities of ML implementation, in this paper, we will survey the applications, vulnerabilities and fortification of ML from the perspective of hardware security. We will discuss the possible future research directions, and thereby, sharing a roadmap for the hardware security community in general.},

abstract={Security tools have evolved dramatically in the recent years to combat the increasingly complex nature of attacks, but to be effective these tools need to be configured by experts that understand network protocols thoroughly. In this paper we present FieldHunter, which automatically extracts fields and infers their types; providing this much needed information to the security experts for keeping pace with the increasing rate of new network applications and their underlying protocols. FieldHunter relies on collecting application messages from multiple sessions and then applying statistical correlations is able to infer the types of the fields. These statistical correlations can be between different messages or other associations with meta-data such as message length, client or server IPs. Our system is designed to extract and infer fields from both binary and textual protocols. We evaluated FieldHunter on real network traffic collected in ISP networks from three different continents. FieldHunter was able to extract security relevant fields and infer their nature for well documented network protocols (such as DNS and MSNP) as well as protocols for which the specifications are not publicly available (such as SopCast) and from malware such as (Ramnit).},

abstract={In the twenty-first century, trust has become an influential factor in people and organizations. As the world is advancing digitally, mobile and cloud services have become the principal drivers of this era. The conventional frameworks to protect such an environment have dissolved. There existed a period where organization resources were put away inside the secure perimeter and regarded as safe. Moreover, the recent work-from-home culture provides attackers with a rather significant opportunity to breach security controls. Everybody is deemed trustworthy inside the network, allowing an intruder to gain escalated access inside the perimeter. These fortresses currently permit clients to get sustained information from outside the fortification since everybody is `trusted excessively.' making our current foundation defenseless to attackers. This paper proves `Zero Trust' as another worldview of online protection. It explores the previous work related to Zero Trust implementation and its research. It discusses Zero Trust as a potential for future network security. It uses containers to implement the architecture, which responds to various types of attacks. It focuses on security at every OSI model layer and the advantages and disadvantages of Zero Trust Architecture.},

abstract={Audio watermarking techniques can be used not only as a copyright protect system but also as a short-range wireless data transmission system between a loudspeaker and a microphone. To send data through aerial space using acoustic signal, the length of frequency analysis window should be longer than the reverberation time, which, however, can degrade the quality of watermarked audio signal. In this paper, we propose an audio quality enhancement technique for acoustic data transmission application based on segmental SNR adjustment. The acoustic data transmission system which employs the proposed audio watermarking technique with long frequency analysis window showed better transmission performance than the previous system.},

abstract={Automobile manufacturers around the world are increasingly deploying Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices in their factories to accompany the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Security and privacy are the main limitations to the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) into industrial processes. Therefore, it is necessary to protect industrial data contained in IIoT devices and keep them confidential. As a step towards this direction, in this paper, we propose a dynamic trust management model suitable for industrial environments. We propose also to change the traditional centralized architecture of IIoT networks in automotive plants into a hybrid architecture based on a set of new industrial relationship rules. The performance evaluation in this work is done in two parts. In the first part, we compare our proposed architecture with the traditional architecture of the plant's IIoT network. The results of this comparison show that our architecture is more suitable to simplify trust management of IIoT devices. In the second part, we demonstrated the ability, the adaptiveness and the resiliency of our proposed trust model against behavioral changes of IIoT nodes in malicious environments.},

pages={545-555},
abstract={The rapidly increasing connectedness of modern vehicles leads to new security challenges for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs), where some potential attackers can achieve unauthorized access to gain control of the vehicle by injecting malicious information into in-vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). Therefore, in this paper, a secure attribute-isolated communication architecture for an ICV, which introduces attributes into the ECUs to achieve authorized access among the ECU nodes is proposed. First, an analysis of the functional attributes of all of the in-vehicle ECUs in an intelligent connected environment and a division of the functional attributes of the ECUs into five classifications are performed. Second, based on the above-classified attributes, a secure attribute-isolated communication architecture is demonstrated. The ECUs have different access rights, allowing only the ECUs with the same functional attributes in the internal network of the vehicle to communicate. Then, it is proven that the proposed architecture can resist forgery and eavesdropping attacks under the random oracle model. Finally, the secure attribute-isolated communication architecture is constructed in a hardware environment and evaluated with an in-vehicle network simulator (IVNS). The evaluation results show that the average memory usage with 120 ECUs and 100 messages is below 40 MB and the bus load can be reduced to 18.96% using the proposed security architecture compared to the bus load of existing architectures. Therefore, the proposed secure attribute-isolated communication architecture solves the problem of the tradeoff between the security threat of unauthorized access and the high bus load of existing in-vehicle architectures.},

Unfortunately, it has been shown recently that machine learning models are highly vulnerable to well-crafted adversarial attacks. This paper develops a novel method for maliciously inserting a backdoor into a well-trained neural network causing misclassification that is only active under rare input keys. As opposed to the existing backdoor attacks on neural networks that alter the weights of the network, the proposed approach targets the computing operations for malicious behavior injection. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology achieves above 99% success rate on average for altering the neural network into the desired predictions given the selected input keys, while remaining undetectable under normal testing data.},

abstract={The challenges thrown by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are unique given their delicate architecture and scant resources. Even though security for wireless networks has been a widely researched area for many decades, security for WSNs is still a major roadblock for their efficiency and performance. This is due to the tussle of how much resources can be expended for security in proportion to the sensor application. The current security perspective for WSNs is on a per-attack basis, which creates an inflexible model resulting in poor efficiency and scalability. The work presented in this paper is the first step in creating a security framework offering high flexibility, good scalability and a redundancy-free security layer for the WSN protocol stack. The proposed framework is based on a resource perspective when deciding security solutions, where solutions are designed to secure each resource in the WSN environment, rather than defend against attacks. Also discussed in this paper are the advantages and preliminary implementation ideas for the proposed framework.},

abstract={Hardware Trojans (HTs), maliciously inserted in an integrated circuit during untrusted design or fabrication process pose critical threat to the system security. With the ever increasing capabilities of an adversary to subvert the system during run-time, it is imperative to detect the manifested Trojans in order to reinforce the trust in hardware. In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, with their intrinsic capability to execute feature engineering at high learning rates, are emerging as promising candidates to be utilized by system defenders. In this paper, we explore Trojan detection mechanisms that are based on ML, and thereby investigate the prowess of the ML algorithms in bolstering system security. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency of each proposed Trojan detection strategy based on the underlying ML algorithm. Finally, we underline some problems with existing Trojan detection approaches and discuss future research in the interest of improved performance of the employed ML algorithms, thus aiding in enhancing the intended hardware security.},

The proposed algorithm estimates the number of bins through an exhaustive search and then the presence of a watermark is decided by a tailor made normality test.

abstract={Cloud infrastructures play an increasingly important role for telecom operators, because they enable internal consolidation of resources with the corresponding savings in hardware and management costs. However, this same consolidation exposes core services of the infrastructure to very disruptive attacks. This is indeed the case with monitoring, which needs to be dependable and secure to ensure proper operation of large datacenters and cloud infrastructures. We argue that currently existing centralized monitoring approaches (e.g., relying on a single solution provider, using single point of failure components) represent a huge risk, because a single vulnerability may compromise the entire monitoring infrastructure. In this paper, we describe the TRONE approach to trustworthy monitoring, which relies on multiple components to achieve increased levels of reliance on the monitoring data and hence increased trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the TRONE framework for event dissemination, on security-oriented diagnosis based on collected events and on fast network adaptation in critical situations based on multi-homing application support. To validate our work, we will deploy and demonstrate our solutions in a live environment provided by Portugal Telecom.},

abstract={Today's online social networks (OSNs) are plagued by Sybil attack in the form of the creation of fake accounts. A promising way to perform Sybil detection is to utilize the topological features of social network, but effectively mining such information is difficult as nodes are highly correlated. We propose a new Sybil detection method based on the interaction graph embedding. In particular, we model the friend requests of users as a signed interaction graph, and perform Sybil detection Uy decoupling the graph into independent vectors in a low-dimensional space. The intuition of our embedding is to enable every user to stay close to the people he/she accepts whereas keeping far away from those helshe rejects in the space. We prove that the objective of our embedding is equivalent to finding the graph cut which can reliably detect a region comprised of Sybils. To efficiently obtain the desired embedding, we propose an novel multi-level optimization to solve the aforementioned objective. We show that our embedding-based approach can discern Sybils under a broad range of scenarios and outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm that directly detects Sybil region over the graph.},

However, the security problems inherent to cooperative communications also arise. In this paper we investigate the situation where some of the cooperative nodes are compromised and try to corrupt the communications by sending garbled signals. To combat the compromised nodes, we extended our previous work and proposed compromised nodes detection algorithms for three more general scenarios. These scenarios include having different numbers of nodes in the transmitting and receiving clusters, having multiple compromised nodes in the transmitting cluster, and having multiple compromised nodes in both the transmitting and receiving clusters. These algorithms are then integrated into a cross-layer security scheme for secure cooperative MIMO network. This scheme combines cryptographic technique implemented in higher layers with proposed data assurance analysis at the physical layer to provide better security. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms for compromised nodes detection are effective and efficient. Simulations also show that the accuracy of received information is significantly improved.},

In this study, the lack of understanding about security-related mechanism in TLS, session management, and web application still become the culprit of most attack and vulnerability.

Tremendous increase of data usage on real world computer networks leads to analyze/monitor these data for anomalous activity. Analyzing and monitoring these high volumes of data is termed big data analytics, which needs an efficient scheme to handle such big data and to model user behavior.

abstract={The proliferation of attack-for-hire services, coupled with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled botnets, is driving the increase of the frequency and intensity of Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks, at an alarming rate. Inspired by the success of machine learning in a variety of fields and domain applications, numerous intelligent schemes have been proposed to effectively defend against and mitigate the impact of these attacks. Traditional machine learning methods, however, are limited by the use of an expensive and error-prone feature engineering process. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. Furthermore, the ability of these schemes to successfully detect previously unknown attacks is limited. To address these limitations, a novel DDoS detection scheme, based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is proposed. The basic tenet of the LSTM scheme is its ability to distinguish between attack and legitimate flows by only examining a relatively small number of a network flow packets. The performance evaluation results show that the LSTM-based scheme successfully learns the complex flow-level feature representations embedded in raw input traffic. Furthermore, the results show that the scheme performs better than other approaches that use sophisticated flow-level statistical features. Lastly, the results show the ability of the proposed scheme to accurately capture the dynamic behaviors of unknown network traffic exceeds that of traditional machine learning methods.},

abstract={The evolution of malware is continuing at an alarming rate, despite the efforts made towards detecting and mitigating them. Malware analysis is needed to defend against its sophisticated behaviour. However, the manual heuristic inspection is no longer effective or efficient. To cope with these critical issues, behaviour-based malware detection approaches with machine learning techniques have been widely adopted as a solution. It involves supervised classifiers to appraise their predictive performance on gaining the most relevant features from the original features’ set and the trade-off between high detection rate and low computation overhead. Though machine learning-based malware detection techniques have exhibited success in detecting malware, their shallow learning architecture is still deficient in identifying sophisticated malware. Therefore, in this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Windows malware detector has been proposed that uses the execution time behavioural features of the Portable Executable (PE) files to detect and classify obscure malware. The 10-fold cross-validation tests were conducted to assess the proficiency of the proposed approach. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was effective in uncovering malware PE files by utilizing significant behavioural features suggested by the Relief Feature Selection Technique. It attained detection accuracy of 97.968 percent.},

abstract={Hardware-based malware detectors (HMDs) are a promising new approach to defend against malware. HMDs collect low-level architectural features and use them to classify malware from normal programs. With simple hardware support, HMDs can be always on, operating as a first line of defense that prioritizes the application of more expensive and more accurate software-detector. In this paper, our goal is to increase the accuracy of HMDs, to improve detection, and reduce overhead. We use specialized detectors targeted towards a specific type of malware to improve the detection of each type. Next, we use ensemble learning techniques to improve the overall accuracy by combining detectors. We explore detectors based on logistic regression (LR) and neural networks (NN). The proposed detectors reduce the false-positive rate by more than half compared to using a single detector, while increasing their sensitivity. We develop metrics to estimate detection overhead; the proposed detectors achieve more than 16.6× overhead reduction during online detection compared to an idealized software-only detector, with an 8× improvement in relative detection time. NN detectors outperform LR detectors in accuracy, overhead (by 40 percent), and time-to-detection of the hardware component (by 5×). Finally, we characterize the hardware complexity by extending an open-core and synthesizing it on an FPGA platform, showing that the overhead is minimal.},

abstract={Application-layer distributed denial-of-service (L7 DDoS) attacks, by exploiting application-layer requests to overwhelm functions or components of victim servers, have become a rising major threat to today's Internet. However, because the traffic from an L7 DDoS attack appears legitimate in transport and network layers, it is difficult for traditional DDoS solutions to detect and defend against an L7 DDoS attack. In this paper, we propose a new, reinforcement-learning-based approach to L7 DDoS attack defense. We introduce a multiobjective reward function to guide a reinforcement learning agent to learn the most suitable action in mitigating L7 DDoS attacks. Consequently, while actively monitoring and analyzing the victim server, the agent can apply different strategies under different conditions to protect the victim: When an L7 DDoS attack is overwhelming, the agent will aggressively mitigate as many malicious requests as possible, thereby keeping the victim server functioning (even at the cost of sacrificing a small number of legitimate requests); otherwise, the agent will conservatively mitigate malicious requests instead, with a focus on minimizing collateral damage to legitimate requests. The evaluation shows that our approach can achieve minimal collateral damage when the L7 DDoS attack is tolerable and mitigate 98.73 % of the malicious application messages when the victim is brought to its knees.},

Existing DDoS mitigation techniques either lack in performance or jeopardize the accuracy of the attack detection. To fill the voids, we propose in this paper a machine learning-based DDoS mitigation technique for SDN.

abstract={The growth of electronic devices in connected vehicles and their connections to the untrusted network, present unprecedented exposure to attacks. Therefore, a reliable and efficient cyber security framework is mandatory to protect vehicular networks against the cyber attackers. Thereby, we propose a cyber defense framework based on a hierarchical cooperative game to secure legitimate vehicles from attacks. In the proposed hierarchical game, there are two kinds of players, the head agent and secondary agents that cooperate between each other to detect, predict and react efficiently against suspected attacks. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prediction System (IPS), and Intrusion Reaction System (IRS) represent the secondary players, where their strategies are to carry out the detection, prediction and reaction actions, respectively. The Intrusion Decision Agent (IDA) is the head player and is responsible for making decisions in launching the strategies of IDS, IPS and IRS players. The secondary and head agents are to collaborate in order to decrease the false positive and false negative rates, while minimizing the processing delay and overhead. Numerical results show that, our cyber defense game requires low communications overhead and low delay to achieve low false positive and false negative rates as compared to the current intrusion detection and prediction frameworks.},

abstract={Secure wireless access in ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), which is a critical aspect of 5G security, has become increasingly important due to its potential support of grant-free configuration. In grant-free URLLC, precise allocation of different pilot resources to different users that share the same time-frequency resource is essential for the next generation NodeB (gNB) to exactly identify those users under access collision and to maintain precise channel estimation required for reliable data transmission. However, this process easily suffers from attacks on pilots. We in this article propose a quantum learning based nonrandom superimposed coding method to encode and decode pilots on multidimensional resources, such that the uncertainty of attacks can be learned quickly and eliminated precisely. Particularly, multiuser pilots for uplink access are encoded as distinguishable subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) and gNB decodes pilots of interest from observed SAPs, a superposition of SAPs from access users, by joint design of attack mode detection and user activity detection though a quantum learning network (QLN). We found that the uncertainty lies in the identification process of codeword digits from the attacker, which can be always modelled as a black-box model, resolved by a quantum learning algorithm and quantum circuit. Novel analytical closed-form expressions of failure probability are derived to characterize the reliability of this URLLC system with short packet transmission. Simulations how that our method can bring ultra-high reliability and low latency despite attacks on pilots.},

The AES key shared between FPGA and client for the bitstream encryption is generated in hard-wired logic using PKI and ECC. The data security is assured by the enclaved processing with encrypted data, meaning that the encrypted data is processed inside the FPGA fabric. Thus, no one in the system is able to look into clients' data because plaintext data are not exposed to memory and/or memory-mapped space. SafeDB is resistant not only to the side channel attack but to the attacks from malicious insiders.

abstract={Low-rate Denial of service (LDoS) attacks has become one of the biggest threats to the Internet, cloud computing platforms, and big data centers. As an evolutionary species of DDoS attack, LDoS attack is essentially different from the DDoS attack. DDoS attacks are the behavior of malicious blocking legitimate network traffic by destroying the targets and the infrastructure around it with huge network traffic. While, LDoS attacks are the behavior of intentional degrading the quality of TCP links by throttling TCP flows to a small fraction of its ideal rate with periodic small pulse sequence. Hence, LDoS attack has a very small flow (around 10%-20% of the background traffic), it is easy to eluding the detection of routers and counter-DoS mechanisms. We try to reveal the mechanism of the LDoS attack and attempt to figure out the generation principle of LDoS attack in this paper. We classify the LDoS attacks and existing defense methods according to time domain and frequency domain in which detection and defense are performed. Furthermore, we highlight the filter approach to defense against LDoS attack. The initial purpose of our work is to encourage researchers to study effective ways to detect and defend against LDoS attacks with innovation and aggressiveness.},

The aim is to ease the backhaul impacts and offer an improved user experience. However, the edge artificial intelligence exacerbates the security of the cloud computing environment due to the dissociation of data, access control, and service stages. In order to prevent users from carrying out lateral movement attacks in an edge-cloud computing environment, in this paper we propose a real-time lateral movement detection method, named CloudSEC, based on an evidence reasoning network for the edge-cloud environment. First, the concept of vulnerability correlation is introduced. Based on the vulnerability knowledge and environmental information of the network system, the evidence reasoning network is constructed, and the lateral movement reasoning ability provided by the evidence reasoning network is then used. The experiment results show that CloudSEC provides a strong guarantee for the rapid and effective evidence investigation, as well as real-time attack detection.},

abstract={Detecting fake accounts (also called Sybils) is a fundamental security problem in online social networks (OSNs). Existing feature-based or social-graph-based approaches suffer from the key limitations: they can only leverage either node feature or graph structure properties such as fast-mixing and conductance, but not both. To overcome this shortcoming, we explore the introduction of recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data into Sybil detection field. These types of models enable integrating both user-level activities and graph-level structures for a new generation of feature-and-graph-based detection mechanisms. However, we find that although applying Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are effective against naïve attacks, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in which fake accounts alter local edges and features with patterns to resemble real users. In this paper, we present TrustGCN, a Sybil-resilient defense algorithm that combines the idea of social-graph-based defense with GCN. TrustGCN first assigns trust scores to nodes based on the landing probability of short random walks that starts from known real accounts. As this short, supervised random walk is likely to stay within the subgraph consisting of real accounts, most real accounts receive higher trust scores than fakes. Then it introduces these trust scores as edge weights and adopts graph convolution operations to aggregate features of local graph neighborhoods over this weighted graph for classification. In this way, we prevent Sybil partners with low trust scores from contributing to the feature aggregation for a target node, thus is more robust against adverse manipulations of the attackers. Our experiment on real data demonstrates that TrustGCN significantly outperforms GCN in the robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine social-graph-based defenses with graph neural networks into a unified model, paving the way for the robust feature-and-graph-based detection mechanisms.},

abstract={Participating in mobile services by synthesizing trajectories with consistent lifestyle and meaningful mobility as actual traces are the most popular way to protect location privacy. However, recent trajectory synthesizing techniques are still threatened by the information that the attacker inevitably obtains, such as the locations of the accepted tasks in the crowdsourcing application. With this information and the spatiotemporal correlation hidden in the user's mobility, the attacker can infer the user's actual location and even future behaviors. It remains open to defend against such inferential attacks in the continual crowdsourcing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware differentially private solution, ConCrowdDP, for achieving the privacy-preserving continual crowdsourcing application. Specifically, before starting the application, we first construct a spatiotemporal mobile model, STMarkov, to model the spatiotemporal correlation in users' mobility. Then, a perturbed location is generated for the user to participate in the crowdsourcing application, according to STMarkov and K-norm DP. Finally, we eliminate the privacy threat brought by the accepted task based on K-norm DP and Bayesian posterior theorem. With ConCrowd-DP in place, a mobility-aware differentially private trace is generated for the user to participate in the application continually. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that ConCrowd-DP guarantees the usability of the synthesized trajectory effectively, while providing the DP protection for defending against the inferential attacks which stem from the multiple accepted tasks.},

Social engineering is one of them that addresses the multidisciplinary challenges of cyber security. Nowadays, the attacks associated with social engineering are diverse, including the so-called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These have been the subject of numerous investigations; however, cybernetic attacks of similar nature as grooming have been excluded from these studies. In the last decade, various efforts have been made to understand the structure and approach of grooming from the field of computer science with the use of computational learning algorithms. Nevertheless, these studies are not aligned with information security. In this work, the study of grooming is formalized as a social engineering attack, contrasting its stages or phases with life cycles associated with APTs. To achieve this goal, we use a database of real cyber-pedophile chats; this information was refined and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to determine the stages of the attack. Once the number of stages was determined, we proceed to give them a linguistic context, and with the use of machine learning, a linear model was trained to obtain 97.6% of training accuracy. With these results, it was determined that the study of grooming could support research associated with social engineering and contribute to new fields of information security.},

abstract={Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications on integrated circuits (IC), which pose a grave threat to the security of modern military and commercial systems. Existing methods of detecting hardware Trojans are plagued by the inability of detecting all Trojans, reliance on golden chip that might not be available, high time cost, and low accuracy. In this paper, we present Golden Gates, a novel detection method designed to achieve a comparable level of accuracy to full reverse engineering, yet paying only a fraction of its cost in time. The proposed method inserts golden gate circuits (GGC) to achieve superlative accuracy in the classification of all existing gate footprints using rapid scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backside ultra thinning. Possible attacks against GGC as well as malicious modifications on interconnect layers are discussed and addressed with secure built-in exhaustive test infrastructure. Evaluation with real SEM images demonstrate high classification accuracy and resistance to attacks of the proposed technique.},

abstract={Recently, adversarial examples have imposed a serious threat to the robustness of deep models and raise potential risks in AI-Security areas. To defend adversarial attacks, we develop a novel defense paradigm via embedding scatter and feature alignment to enhance model's robustness. We first propose a margin constraint loss to encourage better discriminative representations of samples, i.e., increasing inter-class distance and reducing intra-class distance simultaneously. Then a novel method is introduced to seek the representation anchors channel-wisely, which quantizes the learned representations into different scatters. During the inference stage, we first align the extracted representation from the input data onto the most similar anchors and use these anchors replace the representations. Finally, we rebuild and feed these aligned representations into the classifier to get the result. This novel paradigm for utilizing representation anchors channel-wisely provides a new viewpoint to understand the CNN's fragility. Extensive experiments on several datasets well demonstrate that the proposed method improves models' robustness without compromising performance.},

abstract={Sybil attacks are becoming increasingly widespread and pose a significant threat to online social systems; a single adversary can inject multiple colluding identities in the system to compromise security and privacy. Recent works have leveraged social network-based trust relationships to defend against Sybil attacks. However, existing defenses are based on oversimplified assumptions about network structure, which do not necessarily hold in real-world social networks. Recognizing these limitations, we propose SYBILFUSE, a defense-in-depth framework for Sybil detection when the oversimplified assumptions are relaxed. SYBILFUSE adopts a collective classification approach by first training local classifiers to compute local trust scores for nodes and edges, and then propagating the local scores through the global network structure via weighted random walk and loopy belief propagation mechanisms. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and real-world network topologies, including a large-scale, labeled Twitter network comprising 20M nodes and 265M edges, and demonstrate that SYBILFUSE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. In particular, SYBILFUSE achieves 98% of Sybil coverage among top-ranked nodes.},

abstract={In a cloud computing environment, future networks will most probably utilize network functions virtualization (NFV) which is a network architecture concept that proposes virtualizing network node functions into “building blocks” or entities that may be operationally connected or linked together to provide services. However, applying these mechanisms brings security challenges. Due to the programmability of software defined networking (SDN), if attackers gain access to an SDN controller, then the whole network may be exploited by the attackers. The attackers may change forwarding paths and pass malicious traffic to infect the SDN enabled network. To detect the security attacks and malicious traffic early enough and to protect the network, centralized monitoring and intrusion detection system (IDS) monitoring may be used for enhancing SDN, NFV and OpenFlow security. If the network traffic is analysed and the anomalies are detected, the SDN controller may be used to block such traffic from passing through the network by flow control, i.e. forwarding paths in a switch. IDS and intrusion prevention system (IPS) may be deployed at the gateway node to detect a security intrusion. Thus, the data traffic originated from a subscriber passes through each network element until the traffic reaches the gateway node. Such traffic may attack the network elements and may also cause a denial of service (DoS) attack in the network. IDS devices are designed to handle network traffic in real time, yet the cost and high processing time is a challenge for handling the traffic load. Combining dynamicity and programmability of SDN together with traffic filtering of IDS, enables a scalable, redundant and reliable anomaly detection for mobile network operators. In this study, we propose an architecture that combines IDS with programmability features of SDN for detection and mitigation of malicious traffic. Mitigation will be performed by SDN controller using flow control techniques. The proposed architecture can be applied to an SDN enabled mobile network with two different approaches for improved performance in terms of computation power.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables flexible and scalable network control and management. However, it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. In particular, low-rate and slow or stealthy Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are recently attracting attention from researchers because of their detection challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning based defense framework named Q-MIND, to effectively detect and mitigate stealthy DoS attacks in SDN-based networks. We first analyze the adversary model of stealthy DoS attacks, the related vulnerabilities in SDN-based networks and the key characteristics of stealthy DoS attacks. Next, we describe and analyze an anomaly detection system that uses a Reinforcement Learning-based approach based on Q-Learning in order to maximize its detection performance. Finally we outline the complete Q-MIND defense framework that incorporates the optimal policy derived from the Q- Learning agent to efficiently defeat stealthy DoS attacks in SDN-based networks. An extensive comparison of the Q-MIND framework and currently existing methods shows that significant improvements in attack detection and mitigation performance are obtained by Q-MIND.},

abstract={Application-layer distributed denial of service (AL-DDoS) attacks are becoming critical threats to websites because the stealth of AL-DDoS attacks makes many intrusion prevention systems ineffective. To detect AL-DDoS attacks aimed at websites, we propose a novel statistical model called the RM (rhythm matrix). Although the original features from the network layer are adopted, the access trajectory, including requested objects and corresponding dwell-time values, can be abstracted and accumulated into an RM. With an RM, we can almost losslessly compress complex features into a simple structure and characterize the user access behavior. We detect AL-DDoS attacks according to the increase of the abnormality degree in the RM and further identify malicious hosts based on change-rate outliers. In the experiments, we simulate three modes of AL-DDoS attacks with the latest popular DDoS attack tools: LOIC and HOIC. The results show that our method can detect these simulated attacks and identify the malicious hosts accurately and efficiently. For an AL-DDoS detection method, the ability to distinguish flash crowds is indispensable. We also demonstrate the excellent performance of our approach in distinguishing flash crowds from AL-DDoS attacks with two reconstructed public datasets.},

pages={76-87},
abstract={Security analysts widely use dynamic malware analysis environments to exercise malware samples and derive virus signatures. Unfortunately, malware authors are becoming more aware of such analysis environments. Therefore, many have embedded evasive logic into malware to probe execution environments before exposing malicious behaviors. Consequently, such analysis environments become useless and evasive malware can damage victim systems with unforeseen malicious activities. However, adopting evasive techniques to bypass dynamic malware analysis is a double-edged sword. While evasive techniques can avoid early detection through sandbox analysis, it also significantly constrains the spectrum of execution environments where the malware activates. In this paper, we exploit this dilemma and seek to reverse the challenge by camouflaging end-user execution environments into analysis-like environments using a lightweight deception engine called SCARECROW. We thoroughly evaluate SCARECROW with real evasive malware samples and demonstrate that we can successfully deactivate 89.56% of evasive malware samples and the variants of ransomware (e.g., WannaCry and Locky) with little or no impact on the most commonly used benign software. Our evaluation also shows that SCARECROW is able to steer state-of-the-art analysis environment fingerprinting techniques so that end-user execution environments with SCARECROW and malware analysis environments with SCARECROW become indistinguishable.},

abstract={Botnets are overlay networks built by cyber-criminals from hacked smartphones and computers. In this paper, we report a vulnerability of the air interface of 4G cellular networks, the Long Term Evolution (LTE), to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks launched from botnets. The attack scenario constitutes of a bot-master instructing the botnet nodes to start sending or downloading dummy data in order to overwhelm the air interface, thereby denying service for voice users. Through simulation using a capable LTE simulator, we determine the number of botnet nodes needed per cell that can effectively render the cellular network unusable. Specifically, we show that a botnet that has spread to only 3% of subscribers is capable of lowering the voice quality from 4.3 to 2.8 in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale of 1 to 5 for scheduling strategies designed for realtime flows. On the other hand, a botnet that has managed to spread to 6% of subscribers can cause a MOS value of 1, i.e., a complete outage. The threat identified and the reported results could inspire the implementation of new mechanisms to ensure the security and availability of vital telecommunication services.},

As AI system inherits security threats of traditional computer system, the concern about novel cyberattack enhanced by AI is also growing. In addition, AI is deeply connected to physical space (e.g. autonomous vehicle, intelligent virtual assistant), so AI-related crime can harm people physically, beyond the cyberspace. In this context, we represent a literature review of security threats and AI-related crime. Based on the literature review, this article defines the term AI crime and classifies AI crime into 2 categories: AI as tool crime and AI as target crime, inspired by a taxonomy of cybercrime: Computer as tool crime and Computer as tool crime. Through the proposed taxonomy, foreseeable AI crimes are systematically studied and related forensic techniques are also addressed. We also analyze the characteristics of the AI crimes and present challenges that are difficult to be solved with the traditional forensic techniques.

abstract={Nowadays, mobile devices are an important part of our everyday lives since they enable us to access a large variety of ubiquitous services.

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools. With this categorization we aim to provide an easy and concise view of the underlying model adopted by each approach.},

abstract={Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision, speech, and language processing tasks. However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world. In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our attacks utilize a novel local-search based technique to construct numerical approximation to the network gradient, which is then carefully used to construct a small set of pixels in an image to perturb. We demonstrate how this underlying idea can be adapted to achieve several strong notions of misclassification. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test for designing robust networks.},

abstract={Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and aviation sector have resulted in the emergence of smart airports. Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports. Furthermore, we provide a classification of smart airport sub-systems based on their purpose and criticality and address cyber threats that can affect the security of smart airport's networks.},

This process is impaired or prevented by privacy-preserving protocols and tools, that encrypt the communication content, and (in case of anonymity tools) additionally hide the source, the destination, and the nature of the communication. In this paper, leveraging a public dataset released in 2017, we provide classification results with the aim of investigating to which degree the specific anonymity tool (and the traffic it hides) can be identified, when compared to the traffic of other considered anonymity tools, using five machine learning classifiers. Initially, flow-based TC is considered, and the effects of feature importance and temporal-related features to the network are investigated. Additionally, the role of finer-grained features, such as the (joint) histogram of packet lengths (and inter-arrival times), is determined. Successively, “early” TC of anonymous networks is analyzed. Results show that the considered anonymity networks (Tor, I2P, JonDonym) can be easily distinguished (with an accuracy of 99.87% and 99.80%, in case of flow-based and early-TC, respectively), telling even the specific application generating the traffic (with an accuracy of 73.99% and 66.76%, in case of flow-based and early-TC, respectively).},

abstract={This paper reports on the ICDAR2017 Competition on Layout Analysis for Challenging Medieval Manuscripts (HisDoc-Layout-Comp) and provides further details and discussions. In this competition we introduce a new challenging dataset and state-of-the-art benchmark results for pixel-labelling and text line segmentation. The DIVA-HisDB comprises medieval manuscripts with complex layout in contrast to previous datasets, where rectangular text blocks and only a few decorative elements exist. In particular, the images of this competition contain many interlinear and marginal glosses as well as texts in various sizes and decorated letters. This makes the distinction of the four target labels (text, comment, decoration, and background) more difficult. In addition, to reflect the needs of scholars in the humanities, we request multi-labeling of certain regions (decorated text as text and decoration). Furthermore, we measure not just the accuracy, but the Intersection over Union (IU) of pixel sets, which better reflects the real performance. Indeed, in our results we observe that the accuracy appears to be rather high, but the IU reveals, that there is still room for improvement. For the task of line segmentation, the recognition results are rather low (overall error higher than 5%). Noteworthy, a combination of the best layout analysis method with an adapted seam-carving based method achieves better results than the best contestant.},

abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) predictions have been shown to be vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. Specifically, image-agnostic (universal adversarial) perturbations added to any image can fool a target network into making erroneous predictions. Departing from existing defense strategies that work mostly in the image domain, we present a novel defense which operates in the DNN feature domain and effectively defends against such universal perturbations. Our approach identifies pre-trained convolutional features that are most vulnerable to adversarial noise and deploys trainable feature regeneration units which transform these DNN filter activations into resilient features that are robust to universal perturbations. Regenerating only the top 50% adversarially susceptible activations in at most 6 DNN layers and leaving all remaining DNN activations unchanged, we outperform existing defense strategies across different network architectures by more than 10% in restored accuracy. We show that without any additional modification, our defense trained on ImageNet with one type of universal attack examples effectively defends against other types of unseen universal attacks.},

Less attention is paid to the problem of developing and integrating with a security oracle. In this paper we address the problem of the security oracle, in particular for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. We rely on existing test cases to collect HTML pages in safe conditions, i.e. when no attack is run. Pages are then used to construct the safe model of the application under analysis, a model that describes the structure of an application response page for safe input values. The oracle eventually detects a successful attack when a test makes the application display a web page that is not compliant with the safe model.},

abstract={In social networks, by removing some target-sensitive links, privacy protection might be achieved. However, some hidden links can still be re-observed by link prediction methods on observable networks. In this paper, the conventional link prediction method named Resource Allocation Index (RA) is adopted for privacy attacks. Several defense methods are proposed, including heuristic and evolutionary approaches, to protect targeted links from RA attack. In particular, incremental computation is proposed for accelerating the calculation of fitness in evolutionary approaches. This is the first time to study privacy protection for targeted links against similarity based link prediction attacks. Some links are randomly selected from original network as targeted links for experimentation. The experimental results on nine real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of the evolutionary perturbations, especially EDA, for defending against RA attack. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed perturbation generated by EDA is transferable and can even defend against other link prediction attacks which are based on high order similarity between pairwise nodes, although it is designed to prevent RA attack.},

abstract={Denial of service (DOS) attacks are a serious threat to network security. These attacks are often sourced from virtual machines in the cloud, rather than from the attacker's own machine, to achieve anonymity and higher network bandwidth. Past research focused on analyzing traffic on the destination (victim's) side with predefined thresholds. These approaches have significant disadvantages. They are only passive defenses after the attack, they cannot use the outbound statistical features of attacks, and it is hard to trace back to the attacker with these approaches. In this paper, we propose a DOS attack detection system on the source side in the cloud, based on machine learning techniques. This system leverages statistical information from both the cloud server's hypervisor and the virtual machines, to prevent network packages from being sent out to the outside network. We evaluate nine machine learning algorithms and carefully compare their performance. Our experimental results show that more than 99.7% of four kinds of DOS attacks are successfully detected. Our approach does not degrade performance and can be easily extended to broader DOS attacks.},

abstract={Sparse representation based methods have demonstrated their superior performance in target detection tasks compared to more traditional approaches such as matched subspace detectors and adaptive subspace detectors. However, the existing sparsity-based target detection methods were mostly formulated for and validated on a single imaging modality (sometimes with multiple spectral bands). In many application domains, including art investigation, multimodal data, acquired by different sensors are readily available, and yet, efficient processing techniques for such data are still scarce. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-based multimodal target detection method that processes jointly the information from multiple imaging modalities in a kernel feature space, and making use of the spatial context. We develop our target detector such to be robust to errors in labelled data, which is especially important in applications like digital painting analysis, where pixel-wise manual annotations are unreliable. We apply the proposed method to a challenging application of paint loss detection in master paintings and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a case study with multimodal acquisitions of the Ghent Altarpiece.},

abstract={Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking has fast become a useful technological advancement for a vast range of cyber criminal activities. Cyber crimes from copyright infringement and spamming, to serious, high financial impact crimes, such as fraud, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) and phishing can all be aided by applications and systems based on the technology. The requirement for investigating P2P based systems is not limited to the more well known cyber crimes listed above, as many more legitimate P2P based applications may also be pertinent to a digital forensic investigation, e.g., VoIP and instant messaging communications, etc. Investigating these networks has become increasingly difficult due to the broad range of network topologies and the ever increasing and evolving range of P2P based applications. This paper introduces the Universal Peer-to-Peer Network Investigation Framework (UP2PNIF), a framework which enables significantly faster and less labour intensive investigation of newly discovered P2P networks through the exploitation of the commonalities in network functionality. In combination with a reference database of known network protocols and characteristics, it is envisioned that any known P2P network can be instantly investigated using the framework. The framework can intelligently determine the best methodology dependant on the focus of the investigation resulting in a significantly expedited evidence gathering process.},

abstract={Neural networks have been widely applied but they are still vulnerable to adversarial examples. More and more defense models have been proposed and they can resist the attacks to the neural networks. In order to generate adversarial examples with good transferability, we propose the restricted region based iterative gradient method (RRI-GM) for non-targeted attack, which aims at generating adversarial examples to make black-box defense models output wrong decision. We first use object detection algorithm to restrict some key regions in the images, since we regard perturbation in the key region affects more than the whole image. To improve the efficiency of attacks, we use gradient-based attack methods and they show good performance. In addition, the process is iterated for multiple rounds to generate adversarial examples with good transferability. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that our method can achieve good attack performance against black-box defense models.},

abstract={Network lateral movement or simply called lateral movement is the latest techniques used by cyber attackers to progressively move through a network while they search and gathered key information data to be used for their cyber-attacks. The best defense mechanism to neutralize this attack method is by correlating data from various sources to reveal the structure and perpetual attack patterns. In this paper, we proposed a framework for lateral movement detection based on pattern risk scoring. Users are segmented into clusters and each cluster were assigned a profile. The user who breaches the profile is given a score rating subject to the relationship and accessing patterns. The user with high score is quarantined while low score user is monitored. Any outgoing traffic from the users is temporarily hold whilst the server verifies the destination address. The proposed framework in this paper can be integrated into the existing network security devices such as next-generation firewall, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to improve the lateral movement detection.},

abstract={Cross-media retrieval (CMR) is an attractive networked application where a server responds to queries with retrieval results of different modalities. Different from traditional information retrieval, CMR relies on a more enriched set of machine learning techniques to produce semantic models projecting multimodal data into a common space. A larger training dataset usually gives more accurate models, leading to a better retrieval result. Despite very promising with potential underpinnings in network analytics and multimedia applications, applying CMR in such contexts also faces severe privacy challenges, due to the fact that various data scattering among multiple parties may be sensitive and not allowed to be shared publicly. Studies jointly considering cross-media analytics, privacy protection, collaborative learning, and distributed networking contexts, are relatively sparse. In this work, we propose the first practical system for privacy-preserving cross-media retrieval by utilizing trusted processors. Our scheme enables secure aggregation of the data from distinct parties, and secure canonical correlation analysis (CCA) over collaborated data to obtain semantic models. Verification mechanisms are designed to defend against active attacks from a malicious adversary. Furthermore, to deal with large data sets, we provide a set of optimization methods to accomodate to limited trusted memory and improve the efficiency of training process in CMR. We consider issues such as data block splitting to manage memory overhead, ordering of operations as well as parameters reuse and release to simplify I/O, and parallel computation to speed up dual operations. Our experiments over both synthetic and real datasets show that our solution is very efficient in practice, outperforms the existing solutions, and performs comparably with the original CMR system.},

abstract={Given a black-box classification model and an unlabeled evaluation dataset from some application domain, efficient strategies need to be developed to evaluate the model. Random sampling allows a user to estimate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, but may not provide insight to high-confidence errors. High-confidence errors are rare events for which the model is highly confident in its prediction, but is wrong. Such errors can represent costly mistakes and should be explicitly searched for. In this paper we propose a generalization to the Adversarial Distance search that leverages concepts from adversarial machine learning to identify predictions for which a classifier may be overly confident. These predictions are useful instances to sample when looking for high-confidence errors because they are prone to a higher rate of error than expected. Our generalization allows Adversarial Distance to be applied to any classifier or data domain. Experimental results show that the generalized method finds errors at rates greater than expected given the confidence of the sampled predictions, and outperforms competing methods.},

abstract={Proximity-based malware, such as cyber cellphone worms and trojans, has been identified to be one of the serious open threats to wireless networks operating at the tactical edge. The ability of malware to exploit the vulnerabilities of a wireless mobile platform is often a function of the mix of software and hardware which define its platform. In this paper, we utilize a proactive strategy which takes advantage of platform diversity metrics to defend against cyber worm attacks in tactical networks. This strategy uses dynamic K-Distance pruning to minimize the total number of shared edges between nodes with similar platforms while retaining access to mission-critical services. To achieve this we introduce a new neighborhood diversity metric and show how it can be used to limit the spread of malware in a multi-platform mobile network by reducing contact between machines with similar vulnerabilities. We test our assumptions via an agent-based simulation of epidemic malware in a synthetic tactical network.},

Our Feature Pyramid Decoder (FPD) framework applies to all block-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It implants denoising and image restoration modules into a targeted CNN, and it also constraints the Lipschitz constant of the classification layer. Moreover, we propose a two-phase strategy to train the FPD-enhanced CNN, utilizing ε-neighbourhood noisy images with multi-task and self-supervised learning. Evaluated against a variety of white-box and black-box attacks, we demonstrate that FPD-enhanced CNNs gain sufficient robustness against general adversarial samples on MNIST, SVHN and CALTECH. In addition, if we further conduct adversarial training, the FPD-enhanced CNNs perform better than their non-enhanced versions.},

abstract={Privacy sensitive applications that store confidential information such as personal identifiable data or medical records have strict security concerns. These concerns hinder the adoption of the cloud. With cloud providers under the constant threat of malicious attacks, a single successful breach is sufficient to exploit any valuable information and disclose sensitive data. Existing privacy-aware databases mitigate some of these concerns, but sill leak critical information that can potently compromise the entire system's security. This paper proposes d'Artagnan, the first privacy-aware multi-cloud NoSQL database framework that renders database leaks worthless. The framework stores data as encrypted secrets in multiple clouds such that i) a single data breach cannot break the database's confidentiality and ii) queries are processed on the server-side without leaking any sensitive information. d'Artagnan is evaluated with industry-standard benchmark on market-leading cloud providers.},

abstract={Big data have the characteristics of volume and variety, which causes huge storage and communication overhead. The traditional encryption system has a high computational complexity and cannot effectively implement the secure storage for the big data. In order to solve these problems, a big data secure storage scheme based on compressed sensing (CS-BDCSS) is proposed. First, the primary encryption of plaintext data is realized by the Data Combined Crossover Random Permutation method, and then, the security-enhanced CS is used to compress and re-encrypt the data to reduce the space overhead and achieve secure storage. Aiming at the problem that the key matrix of the traditional CS algorithm is vulnerable to attack, a Hierarchical Security Key Matrix Generation Scheme is proposed; by expanding the secret key space, the hierarchical security protection for sensitive data of different levels is realized. The concept of pseudo-homomorphism encryption is proposed, and the computation based on ciphertext is realized by using the pseudo-homomorphism encryption, which can improve the efficiency of the data analysis on the basis of security. An adaptive secret key-updating mechanism is designed to automatically update the key in CS-BDCSS system so as to avoid the security risk caused by the repeated use of the same key. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve efficient data compression and secure encryption storage.},

abstract={In the last few years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are gaining importance as a data collection mechanism for smart city systems. The development, deployment and operation of these networks involve a wide and heterogeneous set of technologies and participants. In many cases, city councils have outsourced the implementations of their WSNs to different external providers. This has resulted in a loss of control and visibility over the security of each individual WSN and, as well, over the entire system as a whole. In this article, we first describe the security problems related to the present model of WSN implementation within smart city systems. Then, we propose a non-intrusive architecture to recover part of the lost visibility, detect attacks on the WSNs operated by third parties, increase control over the providers and, in general, improve the security of the smart city from a holistic perspective.},

year={2018},

pages={115-123},
abstract={Malware detection is a paramount priority in today's world in order to prevent malware attacks. Malware detection comes in three methods: static analysis, dynamic analysis, and hybrids. Static analysis is fast and effective for detecting previously seen malware where as dynamic analysis can be more accurate and robust against zero-day or polymorphic malware, but at the cost of a high computational load, which results in an often-prohibitive dollar cost for the needed server farm to handle all incoming traffic at an organization's network entry point. Most modern defenses today use a hybrid approach, which uses both static and dynamic analysis to maximize their chances of detecting malware. However, current hybrid approaches are suboptimal. We propose a solution to utilize the strengths of both while minimizing their weaknesses by using a two-phase hybrid detection tool. The first phase is a static tool, which we call a “static-hybrid” tool, that is based on machine learning and static analysis to categorize incoming programs into three buckets: definitely benign, definitely malicious, and needs further analysis. Only the small fraction of programs in the third bucket are run on the dynamic analyzer. Our system approaches the accuracy of the dynamic-only system with only a small fraction of its computational cost, while maintaining a real-time malware detection timeliness similar to a static-only system, thus achieving the best of both approaches.A key feature of our system is that the first (static) phase can run in active mode, i.e. it blocks malware in real time, which is possible because of the low 0.08% rate of mistakenly blocking benign programs as malicious (all results in our salient configuration). The second (dynamic) phase is run in passive mode, i.e. it send alerts for suspected malware without blocking them, and has a higher false positive rate of 0.75%. The first phase blocks 88.98% of malware, whereas the second phase brings up the detection rate to 98.73%. Since only a small fraction of malware missed by the first stage but caught by the second stage generates alerts, our system reduces alerts by 9.5X vs any highly accurate system running by itself in the typical passive mode seen in practice. Since only 3.63% of programs that need further study are sent to the second phase, this reduces the computation load for dynamic analysis by 100/3.63 = 27.5X.},

abstract={The last few years have seen a radical shift in the cyber defense paradigm from reactive to proactive, and this change is marked by the steadily increasing trend of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing. Currently, there are numerous Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources providing periodically updated threat feeds that are fed into various analytical solutions. At this point, there is an excessive amount of data being produced from such sources, both structured (STIX, OpenIOC, etc.) as well as unstructured (blacklists, etc.). However, more often than not, the level of detail required for making informed security decisions is missing from threat feeds, since most indicators are atomic in nature, like IPs and hashes, which are usually rather volatile. These feeds distinctly lack strategic threat information, like attack patterns and techniques that truly represent the behavior of an attacker or an exploit. Moreover, there is a lot of duplication in threat information and no single place where one could explore the entirety of a threat, hence requiring hundreds of man hours for sifting through numerous sources - trying to discern signal from noise - to find all the credible information on a threat. We have made use of natural language processing to extract threat feeds from unstructured cyber threat information sources with approximately 70\% precision, providing comprehensive threat reports in standards like STIX, which is a widely accepted industry standard that represents CTI. The automation of an otherwise tedious manual task would ensure the timely gathering and sharing of relevant CTI that would give organizations the edge to be able to proactively defend against known as well as unknown threats.},

abstract={Watermarking is the process of embedding information into an image that can survive under distortions, while requiring the encoded image to have little or no perceptual difference with the original image. Recently, deep learning-based methods achieved impressive results in both visual quality and message payload under a wide variety of image distortions. However, these methods all require differentiable models for the image distortions at training time, and may generalize poorly to unknown distortions. This is undesirable since the types of distortions applied to watermarked images are usually unknown and non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose a new framework for distortion-agnostic watermarking, where the image distortion is not explicitly modeled during training. Instead, the robustness of our system comes from two sources: adversarial training and channel coding. Compared to training on a fixed set of distortions and noise levels, our method achieves comparable or better results on distortions available during training, and better performance overall on unknown distortions.},

abstract={Phishing and spear phishing are typical examples of masquerade attacks since trust is built up through impersonation for the attack to succeed. Given the prevalence of these attacks, considerable research has been conducted on these problems along multiple dimensions. We reexamine the existing research on phishing and spear phishing from the perspective of the unique needs of the security domain, which we call security challenges: real-time detection, active attacker, dataset quality and base-rate fallacy. We explain these challenges and then survey the existing phishing/spear phishing solutions in their light. This viewpoint consolidates the literature and illuminates several opportunities for improving existing solutions. We organize the existing literature based on detection techniques for different attack vectors (e.g., URLs, websites, emails) along with studies on user awareness. For detection techniques we examine properties of the dataset, feature extraction, detection algorithms used, and performance evaluation metrics. This work can help guide the development of more effective defenses for phishing, spear phishing and email masquerade attacks of the future, as well as provide a framework for a thorough evaluation and comparison.},

abstract={Physical layer security (PLS) technologies have attracted much attention in recent years for their potential to provide information-theoretically secure communications. Artificial Noise (AN)-aided transmission, which can realize secure communications against the external passive eavesdropping, is considered one of the most practicable PLS technologies. In this paper, we reveal that the conventional AN scheme has a severe vulnerability when the eavesdropper adopts Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-based attack, by which the AN-aided transmission will be cracked in a high probability even with most transmission power allocated to AN signals. In order to ensure secure communications, we propose a robust AN scheme focused on the ICA's ability of blind source separation. In our proposed scheme, AN signals are generated with the same modulation scheme and a certain correlation to information signals, thus to introduce irremovable correlation to degrade the ICA's separation performance. Furthermore, we derive the optimal correlation factors from the relation between an information-AN correlation and the ICA's performance. Numerical simulation results with the comparison to the conventional AN scheme show that, our proposed scheme can ensure secure communications by degrading eavesdropper's success probability of attack from 96% to lower than 1%.},

pages={13195-13204},
abstract={Security of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is under severe scrutiny as the deployment of these models become widespread in many intelligence-based applications. Most recently, DNNs are attacked through Trojan which can effectively infect the model during the training phase and get activated only through specific input patterns (i.e, trigger) during inference. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel Targeted Bit Trojan(TBT) method, which can insert a targeted neural Trojan into a DNN through bit-flip attack. Our algorithm efficiently generates a trigger specifically designed to locate certain vulnerable bits of DNN weights stored in main memory (i.e., DRAM). The objective is that once the attacker flips these vulnerable bits, the network still operates with normal inference accuracy with benign input. However, when the attacker activates the trigger by embedding it with any input, the network is forced to classify all inputs to a certain target class. We demonstrate that flipping only several vulnerable bits identified by our method, using available bit-flip techniques (i.e, row-hammer), can transform a fully functional DNN model into a Trojan-infected model. We perform extensive experiments of CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets on both VGG-16 and Resnet-18 architectures. Our proposed TBT could classify 92 of test images to a target class with as little as 84 bit-flips out of 88 million weight bits on Resnet-18 for CIFAR10 dataset.},

abstract={With the rapid development of human society, the urbanization of the world's population is also progressing rapidly. Urbanization has brought many challenges and problems to the development of cities. For example, theurban population is under excessive pressure, various natural resources and energy are increasingly scarce, and environmental pollution is increasing, etc. However, the original urban model has to be changed to enable peopleto live in greener and more sustainable cities, thus providing them with a more convenient and comfortable living environment. The new urban framework, the smart city, provides excellent opportunities to meet these challenges, while solving urban problems at the same time. At this stage, many countries are actively responding to calls for smart city development plans. This paper investigates the current stage of the smart city. First, it introduces the background of smart city development and gives a brief definition of the concept of the smart city. Second, it describes the framework of a smart city in accordance with the given definition. Finally, various intelligent algorithms to make cities smarter, along with specific examples, are discussed and analyzed.},

abstract={In order to direct network traffic towards applications, transport layer protocols such as TCP and UDP add the notion of a port number. A share of these numbers is registered for well-known services such as a web or mail, while some is left to be dynamically assigned by the OS to client connections. A special case is port 0 which is reserved but was never assigned. Traffic from and to port 0 is unusual, because it should not occur in the wild. As port 0 is unassigned, there is no common service listing for connections here. Furthermore, operating systems usually interpret the request to open port 0 as the request to allocate and open any currently unused port. Thus, traffic from and to port 0 should not occur, because no application should listen there and applications cannot send from port 0. In practice, we do however see traffic from and to port 0, which indicates that someone makes the effort to bypass the normal operating system network stack to create these unusual packets. As a corner case of network protocols, the aspect of port 0 has basically never been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we analyze network traffic collected through a /15 network telescope over a period of 3 years to characterize these curious data flows. We find that port 0 traffic seems to be used in the wild by a select few for a variety of purposes, from DDoS attacks to system fingerprinting, and that some of these actors possess a surprisingly sophisticated knowledge of OS behavior.},

abstract={Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds can be viewed as distributed systems of cloud services that are entrusted to execute users' cloud commands to provision and manage clouds computing resources (e.g., VM). However, recent vulnerabilities found in cloud services show that this trust is often misplaced. By exploiting a vulnerability in a cloud service, an adversary can hijack or forge commands to modify user VMs, exfiltrate sensitive information, and even modify other service hosts. This paper introduces Cloud Armor, a system that detects and blocks the tampering of user commands without the need for modifications to cloud services. Our insight is that we can construct state machine models to limit the system call sequences executed by cloud services. By applying constraints over system call arguments, we can restrict the way user commands are executed, blocking unauthorized operations from compromised cloud services. We implemented a prototype Cloud Armor system for Open Stack, a widely adopted open source cloud platform. Results show that Cloud Armor can greatly limit attack options available for adversaries while imposing less than 1% overhead for user VMs. As a result, cloud users can leverage Cloud Armor to execute user commands safely even in presence of compromised cloud services.},

In this paper we propose GADFly - a fast and robust algorithm to detect P2P botnet structures in communication graphs built from network flow meta-data. While other algorithms have been proposed in literature that use graph analysis or machine learning techniques to detect botnets, they are either slow or have impractical false positives for realistically large graphs with millions of nodes. They also assume availability of universal communication graph data, which is not realistic. The method proposed here is able to precisely detect P2P botnet structures with extremely low false positive rates. In addition, GADFly is also very fast and robust in the face of gaps in communication graph data, making it suitable for practical deployments.},

abstract={Machine learning is one of the most prevailing techniques in computer science, and it has been widely applied in image processing, natural language processing, pattern recognition, cybersecurity, and other fields. Regardless of successful applications of machine learning algorithms in many scenarios, e.g., facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection, these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable to a variety of security threats, inducing a significant performance decrease. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy. Finally, we provide five notable trends in the research on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning, which are worth doing in-depth studies in future.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be exploited by the attackers as entry points to break into the IoT networks without early detection. Little work has taken hybrid approaches that combine different defense mechanisms in an optimal way to increase the security of the IoT against sophisticated attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to generate the strategic deployment of adaptive deception technology and the patch management solution for the IoT under a budget constraint. We use a graphical security model along with three evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed defense mechanisms. We apply the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) to compute the {\em Pareto optimal} deployments of defense mechanisms to maximize the security and minimize the deployment cost. We present a case study to show the feasibility of the proposed approach and to provide the defenders with various ways to choose optimal deployments of defense mechanisms for the IoT. We compare the GA with the exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) in terms of the runtime complexity and performance accuracy in optimality. Our results show that the GA is much more efficient in computing a good spread of the deployments than the ESA, in proportion to the increase of the IoT devices.},

abstract={We present a new attack called the snoop-forge-replay attack on keystroke-based continuous verification systems. The snoop-forge-replay is a sample-level forgery attack and is not specific to any particular keystroke-based continuous verification method or system. It can be launched with easily available keyloggers and APIs for keystroke synthesis. Our results from 2640 experiments show that: 1) the snoop-forge-replay attacks achieve alarmingly high error rates compared to zero-effort impostor attacks, which have been the de facto standard for evaluating keystroke-based continuous verification systems; 2) four state-of-the-art verification methods, three types of keystroke latencies, and 11 matching-pair settings (-a key parameter in continuous verification with keystrokes) that we examined in this paper were susceptible to the attack; 3) the attack is effective even when as low as 20 to 100 keystrokes were snooped to create forgeries. In light of our results, we question the security offered by current keystroke-based continuous verification systems. Additionally, in our experiments, we harnessed virtualization technology to generate thousands of keystroke forgeries within a short time span. We point out that virtualization setup such as the one used in our experiments can also be exploited by an attacker to scale and speedup the attack.},

abstract={The base station (BS) in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) plays the role of a data sink, a point of contact with the upper hierarchy, and an in-situ command and control unit. Such an essential role makes the BS a target for attacks in a hostile environment. Even if its presence is camouflaged, an adversary may locate the BS by applying traffic analysis. Basically, the adversary can intercept radio transmissions and correlate them using techniques like Evidence theory (ET). The ET attack model only uses spatial aspects of intercepted transmissions in order to deduce knowledge about data routes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of ET (EET) which utilizes temporal correlation of transmissions to draw further valuable insight about the network topology. Analyzing ET and extending its capability are very fundamental for the network in order to avoid the illusive sense of security by guarding against a weaker attack model than what could be potentially launched. Moreover, we develop a novel and effective countermeasure, called Assisted Deception (AD) that needs no involvement of BS and is resilient to both ET and EET. By implementing AD, nodes coordinate and inject timed deceptive packets to target temporal correlation of consecutive transmissions that EET relies on. The attack and countermeasure are validated through extensive simulation experiments.},

abstract={Developing a robust algorithm for automatic individual tree crown (ITC) detection from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets is important for tracking the responses of trees to anthropogenic change. Such approaches allow the size, growth, and mortality of individual trees to be measured, enabling forest carbon stocks and dynamics to be tracked and understood. Many algorithms exist for structurally simple forests, including coniferous forests and plantations. Finding a robust solution for structurally complex, species-rich tropical forests remains a challenge; existing segmentation algorithms often perform less well than simple area-based approaches when estimating plot-level biomass. Here, we describe a multiclass graph cut (MCGC) approach to tree crown delineation. This uses local 3D geometry and density information, alongside knowledge of crown allometries, to segment ITCs from airborne light detection and ranging point clouds. Our approach robustly identifies trees in the top and intermediate layers of the canopy, but cannot recognize small trees. From these 3D crowns, we are able to measure individual tree biomass. Comparing these estimates with those from permanent inventory plots, our algorithm can produce robust estimates of hectare-scale carbon density, demonstrating the power of ITC approaches in monitoring forests. The flexibility of our method to add additional dimensions of information, such as spectral reflectance, make this approach an obvious avenue for future development and extension to other sources of 3D data, such as structure from motion data sets.},

abstract={Distributed storage platforms draw much attention due to their high reliability and scalability for handling a massive amount of data. To protect user and data privacy, encryption is considered as a necessary feature for production systems like Storj. But it prohibits the nodes from performing content search. To preserve the functionality, we observe that a protocol of integration with searchable encryption and keyword search via distributed hash table allows the nodes in a network to search over encrypted and distributed data. However, this protocol does not address a practical threat in a fully distributed scenario. Malicious nodes would sabotage search results, and easily infiltrate the system as the network grows. Using primitives such as MAC and verifiable data structure may empower the users to verify the search result, but the robustness of the overall system can hardly be ensured. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a protocol that is seamlessly incorporated to encrypted search in distributed network to attest and monitor nodes. From the moment a node joins the system, it will be attested and continuously monitored through verifiable search queries. The result of each attestation is determined via a standard quorum-based voting protocol, and then recorded on the blockchain as a consensus view of trusted nodes. Based on the proposed protocols, malicious nodes can be detected and removed by a majority of nodes in a self-determining manner. To demonstrate the security and efficiency, we conduct robustness analysis against several potential attacks, and perform performance and overhead evaluation on the proposed protocol.},

abstract={It is common to inspect an Android application using static or dynamic analysis techniques. Most traditional tools adopt static analysis techniques due to its low cost and high performance properties. However, since an inspected target could be obfuscated, it is also common to work with dynamic analysis techniques so that complete runtime information can be obtained to provide in-depth application behavior. Although there are already a lot of tools based on dynamic analysis techniques, the capability of such a tool is unknown. It is straightforward to understand the capability of a dynamic analysis tool by measuring its code coverage. However, to our knowledge, there is not a universal approach for measuring code coverage for all dynamic analysis tools, especially when a tool is only accessible remotely. In this paper, we propose an approach to measure code coverage for dynamic analysis tools. We design and implement the approach to measure code coverage for both online and off-line dynamic analysis tools. We then pick online tools including ABM, Anubis, Copper Droid, Tracedroid, as well as off-line tools including standard Android emulator, Droid Box, and Droid Scope. Our measurement results show that the average coverage rate for each tool lies between 20% and 60%.We believe that our approach can provide more information for researchers and developers to better understand and improve the capability of dynamic analysis techniques.},

abstract={Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques have been increasingly adopted in adversarial settings such as spam, intrusion, and malware detection, although their security against well-crafted attacks that aim to evade detection by manipulating data at test time has not yet been thoroughly assessed. While previous work has been mainly focused on devising adversary-aware classification algorithms to counter evasion attempts, only few authors have considered the impact of using reduced feature sets on classifier security against the same attacks. An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks. Inspired by previous work on adversary-aware classifiers, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection model that can improve classifier security against evasion attacks, by incorporating specific assumptions on the adversary's data manipulation strategy. We focus on an efficient, wrapper-based implementation of our approach, and experimentally validate its soundness on different application examples, including spam and malware detection.},

abstract={Deterministic perception of the surrounding environment is both crucial and a challenging task for autonomous vehicles. A wide range of sensors, including LiDAR, RADAR, cameras, and so on, are used to build the perception layer of an autonomous vehicle. Many interfaces, such as OBD-II, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, etc., have been introduced in autonomous vehicles to control various functionalities, including V2X communications, over-the-air updates, security, remote vehicle-health monitoring, and so on. These interfaces are introducing new attack surfaces that can be exploited via external as well as internal attacks. Attackers have successfully demonstrated how to exploit these attack surfaces by crafting attack vectors to launch both insider and external attacks. The sensor and sensor data are also vulnerable to both external and insider attacks. Developing safeguards against these attacks is a steppingstone toward the design and development of reliable autonomous vehicles. For instance, failure to detect and localize sensor data tampering can result in an erroneous perception of the environment and lead to wrong path-planning and control decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-fragile data hiding-based technique for real-time sensor data integrity verification and tamper detection and localization. Specifically, the proposed data hiding-based method relies on 3-dimensional quantization index modulation (QIM)-based data hiding to insert a binary watermark into the LiDAR data at the sensing layer, which is used for integrity verification and tamper detection and localization at the decision-making unit, e.g., the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on a benchmarking LiDAR dataset. The impact of information hiding on the object-recognition algorithm is also evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can successfully detect and localize data tampering attacks, such as fake object insertion (FOI) and target object deletion (TOD). Robustness to noise-addition attacks is also evaluated.},

abstract={With the development of blockchain technology, the use of cryptocurrencies in online payments has become increasingly prevalent. Litecoin, proposed in 2011, is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in market value. Due to certain characteristics, such as the use of pseudonyms as transaction addresses, user privacy could be protected to some extent. However, there are some problems about its privacy guarantees.In this paper, we aim to reveal the severity of deanonymization attacks on online Litecoin payments. Firstly, we simulate purchases on merchant websites accepting Litecoin and monitor trackers embedding on information and payment pages. Secondly, we conduct transaction-linkage attacks on simulated digital and physical transaction flows, respectively. Our results show that a tracker is more likely to find the target transaction on Litecoin blockchain by collecting the digital transaction flows and implementing transaction-linkage attacks. The number of digital transaction flows with anonymous set size 1 and 2 account for 95% and 5% of all digital transaction flows, respectively. The success rate of the transaction-linkage attack is 0.975. To get the optimal uncertainty parameters of transaction-linkage attacks, we introduce a refined deanonymization attack by making real purchases. Finally, we present two new privacy protection measures against transaction-linkage attacks.},

Data aggregation is an efficient way to minimize energy consumption on sensors. In this paper, we propose a practical secure data aggregation scheme, Sen-SDA, based on an additive homomorphic encryption scheme, an identity-based signature scheme, and a batch verification technique with an algorithm for filtering injected false data. We then investigate the feasibility of our scheme using low-cost microcontrollers choosing two popular IEEE 802.15.4-compliant wireless sensor network hardware platforms, MICAz and Tmote Sky, used in real-life deployments.},

In this paper, we initiate a study of creepware using access to a dataset detailing the mobile apps installed on over 50 million Android devices. We develop a new algorithm, CreepRank, that uses the principle of guilt by association to help surface previously unknown examples of creepware, which we then characterize through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. We discovered apps used for harassment, impersonation, fraud, information theft, concealment, and even apps that purport to defend victims against such threats. As a result of our work, the Google Play Store has already removed hundreds of apps for policy violations. More broadly, our findings and techniques improve understanding of the creepware ecosystem, and will inform future efforts that aim to mitigate interpersonal attacks.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose enhanced continuous authentication by supplementing keystroke and mouse dynamics with wrist motion behaviors. Our method bridges the security gap when neither the mouse nor the keyboard is being used, such as during transitions from mouse to keyboard and vice versa, or during intermittent pauses when wrist movement is captured. Context-aware keystroke latency feature cell generation improves performance and solves latency fluctuation - different diagraphs have different latencies in different words. Based on two Random Forest Ensemble Classifiers (RFECs) recognizing the mouse and keystroke actions with corresponding wrist motions and one Sequential Sampling Analysis (SSA) or SSA Dynamic Trust Model (SSA-DTM), the identity of the user can be continuously verified no matter the operation mode - mouse clicking or keyboard typing. Experimental results, based on 44 subjects, show that the proposed approach can reach an FRR of 0.92% for genuine users and an FAR of 0 for attackers. The approach is shown to be more superior in efficient and timely authentications by making an authentication decision within only 35 mixed actions - mouse clicks or keystrokes, compared with conventional methods solely based on the mouse geometry and locomotion features or keystroke latency features.},

To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first study of meter fraud in the context of distributed energy resources (DERs). With an increased penetration of DERs in modern power grids, and with the decline in electricity prices, we show that there is incentive for electricity generators to over-report generation. We quantify the economic impact of cyber-attacks (on meters) that are optimal in that they maximize fraud while circumventing detectors. In doing so, we use consumption data from Ireland, solar generation data from the U.S. and Australia, and wind generation data from France.},

abstract={Keystroke dynamics is the process to identify or authenticate individuals based on their typing rhythm behaviors. Several classifications have been proposed to verify a user's legitimacy, and the performances of these classifications should be confirmed to identify the most promising research direction. However, classification research contains several experiments with different conditions such as datasets and methodologies. This study aims to benchmark the algorithms to the same dataset and features to equally measure all performances. Using a dataset that contains the typing rhythm of 51 subjects, we implement and evaluate 15 classifiers measured by F1-measure, which is the harmonic mean of a false-negative identification rate and false-positive identification rate. We also develop a methodology to process the typing data. By considering a case in which the model will reject the outsider, we tested the algorithms on an open set. Additionally, we tested different parameters in random forest and k nearest neighbors classifications to achieve better results and explore the cause of their high performance. We also tested the dataset on one-class classification and explained the results of the experiment. The top-performing classifier achieves an F1-measure rate of 92% while using the normalized typing data of 50 subjects to train and the remaining data to test. The results, along with the normalization methodology, constitute a benchmark for comparing the classifiers and measuring the performance of keystroke dynamics for insider detection.},

abstract={Tensors, or multidimensional arrays, are data structures that can naturally represent visual data of multiple dimensions. Inherently able to efficiently capture structured, latent semantic spaces and high-order interactions, tensors have a long history of applications in a wide span of computer vision problems. With the advent of the deep learning paradigm shift in computer vision, tensors have become even more fundamental. Indeed, essential ingredients in modern deep learning architectures, such as convolutions and attention mechanisms, can readily be considered as tensor mappings. In effect, tensor methods are increasingly finding significant applications in deep learning, including the design of memory and compute efficient network architectures, improving robustness to random noise and adversarial attacks, and aiding the theoretical understanding of deep networks. This article provides an in-depth and practical review of tensors and tensor methods in the context of representation learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on visual data analysis and computer vision applications. Concretely, besides fundamental work in tensor-based visual data analysis methods, we focus on recent developments that have brought on a gradual increase in tensor methods, especially in deep learning architectures and their implications in computer vision applications. To further enable the newcomer to grasp such concepts quickly, we provide companion Python notebooks, covering key aspects of this article and implementing them, step-by-step with TensorLy.},

abstract={By reducing parameters and quantization, convolutional neural network compression has become the key steps to reduce model size. However, most of the existing work treats these two methods separately, and the work combining the two methods is cumbersome. We propose a simple but highly efficient training-aware convolutional neural network compression paradigm, which elegantly combines lightweight network design and binary network architecture into a three-stage scheme.In the proposed scheme, we keep the first layer as the standard convolution in order to maintain the representation ability of the network, and then use depthwise separable convolution to replace the standard convolution for middle layers, finally we adopt binary quantization for the remaining convolution layers. Our scheme is training-aware, meaning pruning and quantization are explicit and aware to us, unlike the well-known deep compression method where pruning and quantization are unknown before training.Experimental results show that our proposed compression paradigm can achieve 75.4 times of compression ratio compared to maximal 49 times of deep compression, while maintaining similar performance. Both compression ratio and accuracy are much better than the state-of-the-art binary neural network BNN+.},

abstract={In GLOBECOM'10, Adamo et. al. proposed an interesting encryption scheme, called Error Correction-Based Cipher (ECBC), working at the physical layer. This scheme, together with its ancestor, Secret Error Correcting Code (SECC), belongs to the family of Joint Encryption and Error Correction (JEEC), which combines error correction and data encryption as one process to enable efficient implementations. In this paper, we provide rigorous investigation on the security of ECBC and SECC to unveil their cryptographic strengths under chosen-plaintext attacks. For ECBC, we found a 3-stage differential-style attack, which breaks the scheme with O(k × 2deg(f) + 2k) effort, where deg(f) is the degree of the core cryptographic function f. For SECC, we found a similar attack of complexity O(k × 2k+1). Both of the attacks are significantly improved from exhaustive search, e.g., O(22k+kn+n × 2k) for ECBC and O(2kn+ (k+n) × 2k) for SECC. In addition, we exhibit that f used in ECBC's implementation is particularly vulnerable to our attack, which allows the attacker to recover the secret generator matrix in O(1). To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a secure yet lightweight construction of f achieving the maximum degree. Finally, the core part of our attack against ECBC has been implemented utilizing GPU acceleration and demonstrated on a cluster GPU instance provided by Amazon EC2. Experimental results confirm that the original implementation of ECBC scheme can be broken in (almost) constant time (<;0.4 second) regardless of k, whereas the ECBC scheme enhanced by our proposed f can withstand this attack to the maximum extent.},

abstract={We address the problem of finding compact class sets for Korean font images taken under natural and noisy circumstances. Korean font images are prone to misclassification due to the similar, yet subtly different visual characteristics. The classification becomes even more confusing when the images are subject to various pixel-wise or affine translations, such as scaling and shear mapping. We argue that many font class divisions are inherently flawed in the sense that the fonts are divided in an overly-fine manner. To tackle this issue, we propose a system that discovers compact class sets, based on the confusion matrix of the initial classifier. We demonstrate that grouping existing classes into new ones increases the classification accuracy of Korean fonts, and also results in qualitatively intuitive new classes.},

abstract={We apply Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) to the task of traffic sign classification as part of the GTSRB competition. ConvNets are biologically-inspired multi-stage architectures that automatically learn hierarchies of invariant features. While many popular vision approaches use hand-crafted features such as HOG or SIFT, ConvNets learn features at every level from data that are tuned to the task at hand. The traditional ConvNet architecture was modified by feeding 1st stage features in addition to 2nd stage features to the classifier. The system yielded the 2nd-best accuracy of 98.97% during phase I of the competition (the best entry obtained 98.98%), above the human performance of 98.81%, using 32×32 color input images. Experiments conducted after phase 1 produced a new record of 99.17% by increasing the network capacity, and by using greyscale images instead of color. Interestingly, random features still yielded competitive results (97.33%).},

pages={3058-3066},
abstract={Underwater target classification using passive sonar remains a critical issue due to the changeable ocean environment. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown success in learning invariant features using local filtering and max pooling. In this paper, we propose a novel classification framework which combines the CNN architecture with the second-order pooling (SOP) to capture the temporal correlations from the time-frequency (T-F) representation of the radiated acoustic signals. The convolutional layers are used to learn the local features with a set of kernel filters from the T-F inputs which are extracted by the constant-Q transform (CQT). Instead of using max pooling, the proposed SOP operator is designed to learn the co-occurrences of different CNN filters using the temporal feature trajectory of CNN features for each frequency subband. To preserve the frequency distinctions, the correlated features of each frequency subband are retained. The pooling results are normalized with signed square-root and l2 normalization, and then input into the softmax classifier. The whole network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. To explore the generalization ability to unseen conditions, the proposed CNN model is evaluated on the real radiated acoustic signals recorded at new sea depths. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields an 8% improvement in classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

abstract={Side-channel attacks are among the most powerful and cost-effective attacks on cryptographic systems. Simulators that are developed for side-channel analysis are very useful for preliminary analysis of new schemes, in depth analysis of existing schemes as well as for analysis of products onearly stages of development. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. We present a first survey of existing simulators that were build for side-channel analysis. We present a new open-source simulator SAVRASCA that can generate simulated power traces based on compiled binary files for many popular AVR microcontrollers. We show how to use our simulator onthe example of DPA Contest 4 and we find a new vulnerability that allows an attacker to mount a differential power analysis (or even simple electromagnetic analysis) attack on the scheme. Our simulator can be used during development of new products in order to test their resistance against side-channel analysis. We also focus the attention of readers on questions ofwhy and how simulators are useful in this domain and try to highlight main issues related to simulators that were developed by the community.},

abstract={Many data mining applications such as clustering and k-NN search rely on distances and relations in the data. Thus, distance preserving transformations, which perturb the data but retain records' distances, have emerged as a prominent privacy protection method. In this paper, we present a novel attack on a generalized form of distance preserving transformations, called relation preserving transformations. Our attack exploits not the exact distances between data, but the relationships between the distances. We show that an attacker with few known samples (4 to 10) and direct access to relations can retrieve unknown data records with more than 95 percent precision. In addition, experiments demonstrate that simple methods of noise addition or perturbation are not sufficient to prevent our attack, as they decrease precision by only 10 percent.},

abstract={Containers emerged as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines (VMs) that offer better microservice architecture support. The value of the container market is expected to reach $2.7 billion in 2020 as compared to $762 million in 2016. Although they are considered the standardized method for microservices deployment, playing an important role in cloud computing emerging fields such as service meshes, market surveys show that container security is the main concern and adoption barrier for many companies. In this paper, we survey the literature on container security and solutions. We have derived four generalized use cases that should cover security requirements within the host-container threat landscape. The use cases include: (I) protecting a container from applications inside it, (II) inter-container protection, (III) protecting the host from containers, and (IV) protecting containers from a malicious or semi-honest host. We found that the first three use cases utilize a software-based solutions that mainly rely on Linux kernel features (e.g., namespaces, CGroups, capabilities, and seccomp) and Linux security modules (e.g., AppArmor). The last use case relies on hardware-based solutions such as trusted platform modules (TPMs) and trusted platform support (e.g., Intel SGX). We hope that our analysis will help researchers understand container security requirements and obtain a clearer picture of possible vulnerabilities and attacks. Finally, we highlight open research problems and future research directions that may spawn further research in this area.},

abstract={As IoT moves beyond a catchphrase and starts to provide meaningful solutions in multiple fields, three of its critical pillars are now well understood: (1) Transducers are needed as means of interacting with the environment and machines, and in converting stimuli to data and vice versa. These sensors and actuators form the basis of contextual awareness. (2) Given that many end-node IoT devices are size and power constrained, local low-power computing is essential. The need for power-efficient end-node and edge computing becomes more apparent when latency, network bandwidth, and real time analytics are considered. (3) Low power communication links to transmit the data between IoT devices and local aggregators or cloud resources form the third pillar. Missing in this picture, and not fully appreciated yet, is the fourth pillar of IoT: privacy and security (P&S). If IoT is all about data, how P&S is treated will determine IoT's fate: a second phase of rapid proliferation or ultimate demise and collapse. Recent breaches in P&S are starting to change the industry's view on this issue. Even IoT end nodes that are low cost and have limited functionality pose significant risk to the entire system when their security is breached. This is due to the networking nature of the IoT that exposes a massive attack surface, making these devices ideal attack points for causing disruptions and stealing sensitive data. PC-era Internet security has been an expensive afterthought that has cost industry and consumers billions of dollars. Therefore, we should approach IoT differently, making P&S a key requirement at the design phase itself, and address all life-cycle aspects from initial deployment to in-field updates, to end-of-life decommissioning. This is a system level challenge that requires complete end-end HW/SW solutions, developed in partnership with the entire ecosystem.},

To overcome these shortages, this paper presents an adaptive depth-color-cue integration framework for Mean-shift tracking. The state-of-art 2D rectangles evolves to 3D cubes for representing target region, and depth and color cues are combined together for representing target appearance. Moreover, a novel depth-data-based motion detection method is introduced to get more reliable motion cues during tracking. Furthermore, a reliability evaluation function is proposed to tune cues' weights based on the assumption that most reliable cues are those which are most discriminative between target region and background regions. Finally, cues' probability distribution maps are integrated for Mean-shift tracking. Extensive experiments under various conditions demonstrate the reliability and robustness of this depth-color-integrated tracking framework.},

volume={5},

pages={18295-18309},
abstract={To address the vast variety of user requirements, applications, and channel conditions, flexibility support is strongly highlighted for 5G radio access technologies (RATs). For this purpose, usage of multiple orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) numerologies, i.e., different parameterization of OFDM-based subframes, within the same frame has been proposed in the third-generation partnership project discussions for 5G new radio. This concept will likely meet the current expectations in multiple service requirements to some extent. However, since the quantity of wireless devices, applications, and heterogeneity of user requirements will keep increasing toward the next decade, the sufficiency of the aforementioned flexibility consideration remains quite disputable for future services. Therefore, novel RATs facilitating much more flexibility are needed to address various technical challenges, e.g., power efficiency, massive connectivity, latency, spectral efficiency, robustness against channel dispersions, and so on. In this paper, we discuss the potential directions to achieve further flexibility in RATs beyond 5G, such as future releases of 5G and 6G. In this context, a framework for developing flexible waveform, numerology, and frame design strategies is proposed along with sample methods. We also discuss their potential role to handle various upper-level system issues, including the ones in orthogonal and nonorthogonal multiple accessing schemes and cellular networks. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the future vision of designing flexible RATs and to point out the possible research gaps in the related fields.},

abstract={A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a constantly self-configuring, infrastructure-less network of mobile devices where each device is wireless, moves without restraint and be a router to put across traffic unassociated to its own use. Every device must be prepared to constantly sustain the information obligatory for routing the traffic. And this is the main challenge in building a MANET. Such networks may be self operating or linked to a larger internet and may have one or multiple different transceivers between nodes resulting in a highly dynamic and autonomous topology. The first focus is on MANET attacks followed by detection of the malicious node from MANET via Polynomial-Reduction Algorithm. Although scientists have assessed many algorithms for the detection and rectification of the malicious nodes in the MANETs, the problem still persists. Due to the unprecedented growth in technology, the unidentified vulnerabilities are also intensifying. Therefore, it is very crucial to come up with some ground-breaking ideas to prevent the MANET. In this paper we are used NS2 simulator to implementing malicious nodes in MANET.},

abstract={We present a Trojan (backdoor or trapdoor) attack that targets deep learning applications in wireless communications. A deep learning classifier is considered to classify wireless signals using raw (I/Q) samples as features and modulation types as labels. An adversary slightly manipulates training data by inserting Trojans (i.e., triggers) to only few training data samples by modifying their phases and changing the labels of these samples to a target label. This poisoned training data is used to train the deep learning classifier. In test (inference) time, an adversary transmits signals with the same phase shift that was added as a trigger during training. While the receiver can accurately classify clean (unpoisoned) signals without triggers, it cannot reliably classify signals poisoned with triggers. This stealth attack remains hidden until activated by poisoned inputs (Trojans) to bypass a signal classifier (e.g., for authentication). We show that this attack is successful over different channel conditions and cannot be mitigated by simply preprocessing the training and test data with random phase variations. To detect this attack, activation based outlier detection is considered with statistical as well as clustering techniques. We show that the latter one can detect Trojan attacks even if few samples are poisoned.},

abstract={The objective of energy efficient routing protocol is to increase the operational lifetime of the wireless sensor networks. Multipath routing protocols enhance the lifetime of the wireless sensor networks by distributing traffic among multiple paths instead of a single optimal path. Transmission of secured data is also an important research concern in the wireless sensor networks. In this paper, a secure node disjoint multipath routing protocol for wireless sensor networks is proposed. Here, the data packets are transmitted in a secure manner by using the digital signature crypto system. It is compared with an ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing protocol. It shows better results in terms of packet delivery fraction, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay compared to the ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing.},

Individuals' reviews in these systems are very important as they not only contribute to building reputations for businesses but also play a guiding role for consumers. However, users' privacy disclosure and the effectiveness of reviews are the urgent problems to be solved for the further development of LBSS. This paper proposes a mechanism to improve effectiveness and privacy preservation for review publication. In users' privacy protection, the mechanism firstly formalizes the model of attackers, then focuses on the identification or inference attack caused by reviews. For improving the effectiveness of reviews, the mechanism introduces users' reputation scores to rank the reviews. We evaluate our mechanism thoroughly by extensive experiments, and the results validate that our mechanism can achieve a better performance.},

abstract={The radio architectures of and protocols used by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are, typically, very similar and are based on IEEE 802.15.4. By concentrating on this standard and the associated employed security techniques, the possibility of designing a transferable safety and privacy enhancement across protocols and services, becomes a reality. WSN applications have expanded significantly over the past decade or so and adopt commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices and publicly available standards, which inherently creates intruder incentives and security challenges. Securing WSNs is a critical requirement due to the challenging burden of protecting the transmitted sensitive information across various applications, while operating under unique security vulnerabilities and a fluctuating radio frequency (RF) spectrum and physical environment. Couple this aspect with establishing a level of trust among network nodes, while providing resilience to interference, it becomes clear that maintaining security is challenging. This paper identifies unique vulnerabilities in WSNs, which have a direct impact on privacy and safety. The prevalent security techniques used in the common PHY and MAC layers of various WSN protocols are discussed in terms of providing the essential security requirements. An experimental visualization of the coexistence issues in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) RF band, which is integral for IoT operations, is provided as an introduction to a new perspective on attacking WSNs. Fundamental attack styles and spectrum sharing/coexistence based intrusions are presented. Typical methods, which use COTS devices and open source software to exploit WSN security holes, are also discussed.},

abstract={Dark Web is one of the most challenging and untraceable mediums adopted by the cyber criminals, terrorists, and state-sponsored spies to fulfil their illicit motives. Cyber-crimes happening inside the Dark Web are alike the real world crimes. However, the sheer size, unpredictable ecosystem and anonymity provided by the Dark Web services are the essential confrontations to trace the criminals. To discover the potential solutions towards cyber-crimes evaluating the sailing Dark Web crime threats is a crucial step. In this paper, we will appraise the Dark Web by analysing the crimes with their consequences and enforced methods as well as future manoeuvres to lessen the crime threats. We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method with the aspiration to provide the direction and aspect of emerging crime threats in the Dark Web for the researchers and specialist in Cyber security field. For this SLR 65 most relevant articles from leading electronic databases were selected for data extraction and synthesis to answer our predefined research questions. The result of this systematic literature review provides (i) comprehensive knowledge on the growing crimes proceeding with Dark Web (ii) assessing the social, economic and ethical impacts of the cyber-crimes happening inside the Dark Web and (iii) analysing the challenges, established techniques and methods to locate the criminals and their drawbacks. Our study reveals that more in depth researches are required to identify criminals in the Dark Web with new prominent way, the crypto markets and Dark Web discussion forums analysis is crucial for forensic investigations, the anonymity provided by Dark Web services can be used as a weapon to catch the criminals and digital evidences should be analysed and processed in a way that follows the law enforcement to make the seizure of the criminals and shutting down the illicit sites in the Dark Web.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used for the monitoring of physical and environmental phenomena, and applicable in a range of different domains (e.g., health care, military, critical infrastructure). When using WSNs in a variety of real-world applications, security is a vital problem that should be considered by developers. As the development of security applications (SAs) for WSNs require meticulous procedures and operations, the software implementation process can be more challenging than regular applications. Hence, in an effort to facilitate the design, development and implementation of WSN security applications, we introduce the Monitoring Core (M-Core). The M-Core is a modular, lightweight, and extensible software layer that gathers necessary data including the internal and the external status of the sensor (e.g., information about ongoing communications, neighbors, and sensing), and provides relevant information for the development of new SAs. Similar to other software development tools, the M-Core was developed to facilitate the design and development of new WSN SAs on different platforms. Moreover, a new user-friendly domain-specific language, the M-Core Control Language (MCL), was developed to further facilitate the use of the M-Core and reduce the developer's coding time. With the MCL, a user can implement new SAs without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying sensor software architecture (e.g., TinyOS). The M-Core has been implemented in TinyOS-2.x and tested on real sensors (Tmote Sky and MicaZ). Using the M-Core architecture, we implemented several SAs to show that the M-Core allows easy and rapid development of security programs efficiently and effectively.},

abstract={Private Browsing Mode (PBM) is widely supported by all major commodity web browsers. However, browser extensions can greatly undermine PBM. In this paper, we propose an approach to comprehensively identify and stop privacy breaches under PBM caused by browser extensions. Our approach is primarily based on run-time behavior tracking. We combine dynamic analysis and symbolic execution to represent extensions' behavior to identify privacy breaches in PBM caused by extensions. Our analysis shows that many extensions have not fulfilled PBM's guidelines on handling private browsing data. To the best of our knowledge, our approach also provides the first work to stop privacy breaches through instrumentation. We implemented a prototype SoPB on top of Firefox and evaluated it with 1,912 extensions. The results show that our approach can effectively identify and stop privacy breaches under PBM caused by extensions, with almost negligible performance impact.},

To address this problem, a constant-bandwidth Butterworth filters bank was utilized for frequency decomposition. Then, our novel feature selection methodology was used for new CSP features ranking and selection. We compare our method with the existing approaches, the results on 4 subjects showed that the new method outperforms the other two existing approaches based on conventional CSP and Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (CSSP), the proposed algorithm yielded lowest test error rate of 2.2±1.8% in subject 1 and will be a up-and-coming signal processing tool for developing BCI and improving the efficiency of the classification method in low-resolution EEG input and small-dataset conditions.},

abstract={IoT network security is generally viewed from the perspective of a single, or few attack surfaces. A general characterization of attack source threat provenance (origin) under multiple concurrently prevailing attacks can be useful for mitigating origins of attacks and studying the profile of propagating threats. This paper proposes a novel graph theoretic threat provenance identification framework for IoT networks called PlumeWalk. Our framework helps in securing large-sized networks by providing fast and accurate topological characterization of threat provenance as implied by the network traffic, and the network configuration. PlumeWalk is efficiently computable on computationally constrained IoT devices. We simulate attacks on confidentiality, integrity and availability of IoT sensors with different transport reliabilities to evaluate the accuracy and compute time savings of PlumeWalk. We show that PlumeWalk outperforms a measure called “Betweenness Centrality” for flagging threat presence, by using lesser compute time and providing better characterization of attack origin / impact. Finally, we compare PlumeWalk with relevant contemporary solutions for modeling IoT network attack characterization and threat propagation.},

Towards that, we revisit the prior work, dedicated to the study of centralization of Bitcoin nodes over the Internet, through a fine-grained analysis of network distribution, and highlight the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network over time. As a result, we show that Bitcoin is vulnerable to spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, and logical partitioning attacks with an increased attack feasibility due to network dynamics. We verify our observations by simulating attack scenarios and the implications of each attack on the Bitcoin . We conclude with suggested countermeasures.},

abstract={Open DNS resolvers are resolvers that perform recursive resolution on behalf of any user. They can be exploited by adversaries because they are open to the public and require no authorization to use. Therefore, it is important to understand the state of open resolvers to gauge their potentially negative impact on the security and stability of the Internet. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive probing over the entire IPv4 address space and found that more than 3 million open resolvers still exist in the wild. Moreover, we found that many of them work in a way that deviates from the standard. More importantly, we found that many open resolvers answer queries with the incorrect, even malicious, responses. Contrasting to results obtained in 2013, we found that while the number of open resolvers has decreased significantly, the number of resolvers providing incorrect responses is almost the same, while the number of open resolvers providing malicious responses has increased, highlighting the prevalence of their threat.},

abstract={With the emergence of cloud native technology, the network slicing enables automatic service orchestration, flexible network scheduling and scalable network resource allocation, which profoundly affects the traditional security solution. Security is regarded as a technology independent of the cloud native architecture in the initial design, traditional passive defense such as “reinforced” and “stacked” is relied on to achieve system security protection. The lack of intrinsic security mechanisms makes the system capability insufficient when faces the uncertain threat brought by vulnerabilities and backdoors under the ecosystem of opening-up and sharing. The static nature of existing networks and computing systems makes them easy to be compromised and hard to defend, and thus it is urgent to provide intrinsic security and proactive protection against the unpredictable attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a novel paradigm named intrinsic cloud security (iCS) from the perspective of dynamic defense. The dynamic defense provides component-level security, and has complementary and consistency with the cloud native environment. In particular, iCS introduces mimic defense and moving target defense (MTD), and makes full use of the new features introduced by cloud native to implement an intrinsic and proactive defense mechanism with acceptable costs and efficiency. The iCS paradigm achieves seamless integration and symbiosis evolution between security and cloud native. We implement a trial of iCS based on 5GC commercial system and evaluate its performance on costs, efficiency and attack success. The result shows that the iCS enhanced mode always can provide a better and more stable defense effects.},

abstract={Privacy protection in Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a new research topic in cyber security and privacy. The state-of-art CBIR systems usually adopt interactive mechanism, namely relevance feedback, to enhance the retrieval precision. How to protect the user's privacy in such Relevance Feedback based CBIR (RF-CBIR) is a challenge problem. In this paper, we investigate this problem and propose a new Private Relevance Feedback CBIR (PRF-CBIR) scheme. PRF-CBIR can leverage the performance gain of relevance feedback and preserve the user's search intention at the same time. The new PRF-CBIR consists of three stages: 1) private query; 2) private feedback; 3) local retrieval. Private query performs the initial query with a privacy controllable feature vector; private feedback constructs the feedback image set by introducing confusing classes following the K-anonymity principle; local retrieval finally re-ranks the images in the user side. Privacy analysis shows that PRF-CBIR fulfills the privacy requirements. The experiments carried out on the real-world image collection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PRF-CBIR scheme.},

abstract={We consider the problem of hiding wireless communications from an eavesdropper that employs a deep learning (DL) classifier to detect whether any transmission of interest is present or not. There exists one transmitter that transmits to its receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper, while a cooperative jammer (CJ) transmits carefully crafted adversarial perturbations over the air to fool the eavesdropper into classifying the received superposition of signals as noise. The CJ puts an upper bound on the strength of perturbation signal to limit its impact on the bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. We show that this adversarial perturbation causes the eavesdropper to misclassify the received signals as noise with high probability while increasing the BER only slightly. On the other hand, the CJ cannot fool the eavesdropper by simply transmitting Gaussian noise as in conventional jamming and instead needs to craft perturbation signals built by adversarial machine learning to enable covert communications. Our results show that signals with different modulation types and eventually 5G communications can be effectively hidden from an eavesdropper even if it is equipped with a DL classifier to detect transmissions.},

pages={747-762},
abstract={After a plethora of high-profile RowHammer attacks, CPU and DRAM vendors scrambled to deliver what was meant to be the definitive hardware solution against the RowHammer problem: Target Row Refresh (TRR). A common belief among practitioners is that, for the latest generation of DDR4 systems that are protected by TRR, RowHammer is no longer an issue in practice. However, in reality, very little is known about TRR. How does TRR exactly prevent RowHammer? Which parts of a system are responsible for operating the TRR mechanism? Does TRR completely solve the RowHammer problem or does it have weaknesses? In this paper, we demystify the inner workings of TRR and debunk its security guarantees. We show that what is advertised as a single mitigation mechanism is actually a series of different solutions coalesced under the umbrella term Target Row Refresh. We inspect and disclose, via a deep analysis, different existing TRR solutions and demonstrate that modern implementations operate entirely inside DRAM chips. Despite the difficulties of analyzing in-DRAM mitigations, we describe novel techniques for gaining insights into the operation of these mitigation mechanisms. These insights allow us to build TRRespass, a scalable black-box RowHammer fuzzer that we evaluate on 42 recent DDR4 modules. TRRespass shows that even the latest generation DDR4 chips with in-DRAM TRR, immune to all known RowHammer attacks, are often still vulnerable to new TRR-aware variants of RowHammer that we develop. In particular, TRRespass finds that, on present-day DDR4 modules, RowHammer is still possible when many aggressor rows are used (as many as 19 in some cases), with a method we generally refer to as Many-sided RowHammer. Overall, our analysis shows that 13 out of the 42 modules from all three major DRAM vendors (i.e., Samsung, Micron, and Hynix) are vulnerable to our TRR-aware RowHammer access patterns, and thus one can still mount existing state-of-the-art system-level RowHammer attacks. In addition to DDR4, we also experiment with LPDDR4(X)1 chips and show that they are susceptible to RowHammer bit flips too. Our results provide concrete evidence that the pursuit of better RowHammer mitigations must continue.},

abstract={As cybercriminals continually challenge the security of enterprises with sophisticated and rapidly evolving exploits, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance resilience against threats by understanding and limiting your focus on enemies that target your industry, efficiently leveraging the limited resources that hinder all SOCs. With a wide array of public and commercial sources that distribute threat intelligence, extending intelligence collection and analysis has become indispensable in developing effective cybersecurity measures.Unstructured data like technical articles and reports are known to be difficult to analyze and formalize. While many previous research works attempt to semantically extract unstructured threat intelligence, none of them is applied for Chinese data sources. As China is both the largest source and victim of cyberattacks, lacking visibility of Chinese data sources is a major blind spot of CTI.In this paper, we present CTI ANT, the first automatic system for analyzing Chinese CTI, which enlarges the threat intelligence visibility to Chinese data sources. CTI ANT is constructed of three sub-systems: an automatic classification system (CSAC) for inspecting threat intelligence types, a recommendation system (CTRS) that identifies trending keywords to assist threat analysts, and a Web API to label MITRE ATT&CK® techniques in Chinese APT reports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed CSAC and CTRS have achieved superior performance with an average accuracy exceeding 93% and 80%, respectively. Moreover, the MITRE ATT&CK Web API presents precise labeling in Chinese ATT&CK reports, stimulating new insights on Chinese CTI.},

One of the technologies that serve such purposes is honeypot. Although the concept of honeypot is not new, its use in a smart grid context is still nascent. Moreover, honeynet, a network of honeypots, is not yet systematically explored in a smart grid context. In this paper, we design and implement a smart grid honeynet system that can emulate an entire smart grid field communication infrastructure including multiple networked substations by taking advantage of virtualization technologies. Our honeynet system is tied to a simulated power grid to provide consistent and realistic view to deceive attackers for a prolonged period. Especially, our system can emulate high-fidelity power grid behavior when a sophisticated attacker launches grid-wide probing at his preparation phase, by changing settings in one substation and examining the expected changes in another. Finally, we present our proof-of-concept implementation and preliminary evaluation of its realism and scalability.},

VC3 runs on unmodified Hadoop, but crucially keeps Hadoop, the operating system and the hyper visor out of the TCB, thus, confidentiality and integrity are preserved even if these large components are compromised. VC3 relies on SGX processors to isolate memory regions on individual computers, and to deploy new protocols that secure distributed MapReduce computations. VC3 optionally enforces region self-integrity invariants for all MapReduce code running within isolated regions, to prevent attacks due to unsafe memory reads and writes. Experimental results on common benchmarks show that VC3 performs well compared with unprotected Hadoop: VC3's average runtime overhead is negligible for its base security guarantees, 4.5% with write integrity and 8% with read/write integrity.},

abstract={DNA fingerprinting can offer remarkable benefits, especially for point-of-care diagnostics, information forensics, and analysis. However, the pressure to drive down costs is likely to lead to cheap untrusted solutions and a multitude of unprecedented risks. These risks will especially emerge at the frontier between the cyberspace and DNA biology. To address these risks, we perform a forensic-security assessment of a typical DNA-fingerprinting flow. We demonstrate, for the first time, benchtop analysis of biochemical-level vulnerabilities in flows that are based on a standard quantification assay known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After identifying potential vulnerabilities, we realize attacks using benchtop techniques to demonstrate their catastrophic impact on the outcome of the DNA fingerprinting. We also propose a countermeasure, in which DNA samples are each uniquely barcoded (using synthesized DNA molecules) in advance of PCR analysis, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach using benchtop techniques. We discuss how molecular barcoding could be utilized within a cyber-biological framework to improve DNA-fingerprinting security against a wide range of threats, including sample forgery. We also present a security analysis of the DNA barcoding mechanism from a molecular biology perspective.},

abstract={Network trace data provide valuable information which contributes to model the network behaviors, defend network attacks and develop new protocols, so releasing the data of network trace is highly demanded by researchers and organizations to promote the development of the network technologies. However, due to the sensitive nature of network trace data, it is a potential risk for organizations to publish the original data which may expose their commercial confidentiality and the customers' privacy within their networks. Several methods to defend the network trace attacks such as statistical fingerprinting and injection have been proposed, unfortunately, they are not enough to protect the privacy because the correspondence between the source and destination IP addresses can also help the adversary to identify the target host. In this paper, we extract the inherent graph structure between the source and destination IP addresses in network trace data, and use k-anonymity to prevent the target host from being identified. Combined with other protection techniques, our method can also prevent the fingerprinting and injection attacks.},

abstract={Wide adoption of artificial neural networks in various domains has led to an increasing interest in defending adversarial attacks against them. Preprocessing defense methods such as pixel discretization are particularly attractive in practice due to their simplicity, low computational overhead, and applicability to various systems. It is observed that such methods work well on simple datasets like MNIST, but break on more complicated ones like ImageNet under recently proposed strong white-box attacks. To understand the conditions for success and potentials for improvement, we study the pixel discretization defense method, including more sophisticated variants that take into account the properties of the dataset being discretized. Our results again show poor resistance against the strong attacks. We analyze our results in a theoretical framework and offer strong evidence that pixel discretization is unlikely to work on all but the simplest of the datasets. Furthermore, our arguments present insights why some other preprocessing defenses may be insecure.},

abstract={We present Byzantine Fault-Avoidance (BFA), a fault-resilient architecture designed for Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems to withstand against attacks and failures. BFA allows replicas to short live on a given computing platform, i.e., hardware, hypervisors and OS, to thwart successful and in-progress attacks while simultaneously preserving the correctness condition of BFT properties; safety and liveness. BFA combines the cloud management software stack of OpenStack (nova) and the Software Defined Network (SDN) implementation (neutron) to control the replicas susceptibility window of attack in order to avoid Byzantine faults. The proposed fault-avoidance scheme illustrates the defensive security solutions enabled by the underlying cloud computing fabric are far superior than the ones implemented at the application/protocol level. Preliminary results of widely studied BFT system (BFT-SMaRT) deployed in a cloud infrastructure (OpenStack-Kilo) indicate that BFA achieves desired BFT reliability properties and throughput over contested environments.},

abstract={Due to the impact of an open deployment environment, severe restrictions in power with poor hardware equipment, and a lack of centralized administration in management, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks aimed at routing and other aspects. To face this problem, we propose a novel trust-aware routing protocol for WSNs which incorporates multiattributes (TRPM) of sensor nodes in terms of communication, data, energy, and recommendation. The proposed trust model relies on an improved sliding time window considering attack frequency to facilitate the discovery of malicious behaviors of attackers. Combined with effective routing detection and maintenance protocol, the performance of our solution is tested through a wide set of simulation experiments. Extensive results reveal that an average packet transfer rate of TRPM is increased by about 19% and time consumption on the routing update is shortened by about 11% in case 20% of all sensor nodes are malicious compared with other existing trust-based routing protocols.},

abstract={We present a system for wide-area multi-object tracking across disjoint camera views. We employ a probabilistic Petri Net-based approach to account for the uncertainties of the vision algorithms (such as unreliable background subtraction, and tracking failure) and to incorporate the available domain knowledge. We combine appearance features of objects as well as the travel-time evidence for target matching and consistent labeling across disjoint camera views. 3D color histogram, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, object size and aspect ratio are used as the appearance features. The distribution of the travel time is modeled by a Gaussian Mixture Model. By incorporating the domain knowledge about the camera configurations and the information about the received packets from other cameras, certain transitions are fired in the probabilistic Petri net. The system is trained to learn different parameters of the matching process. We present wide-area tracking of vehicles as an example where we used three non-overlapping cameras. The first and the third cameras are approximately 150 meters apart from each other with two intersections in the blind region. The results show the success of the proposed method.},

abstract={Zero-day polymorphic worms pose a serious threat to the Internet security. With their ability to rapidly propagate, these worms increasingly threaten the Internet hosts and services. Not only can they exploit unknown vulnerabilities but can also change their own representations on each new infection or can encrypt their payloads using a different key per infection. They have many variations in the signatures of the same worm thus, making their fingerprinting very difficult. Therefore, signature-based defenses and traditional security layers miss these stealthy and persistent threats. This paper provides a detailed survey to outline the research efforts in relation to detection of modern zero-day malware in form of zero-day polymorphic worms.},

abstract={Phishing attacks allure users to submit their personal information to fake websites that mimic legitimate websites. Many anti-phishing techniques have emerged in recent years. However, the numbers of phishing attacks are still increasing. Two reasons can be blamed for this situation. First, users have too much trust and confidence on existing anti-phishing tools in general. Second, most users believe that they are foolproof against phishing attacks when anti-phishing tools are deployed. We believe that understanding of anti-phishing tools based on their common features can be the beginning step to address these issues. However, there is no extensive analysis of existing anti-phishing techniques. This paper attempts to classify existing works based on information sources. The classification would not only provide useful information to develop new anti-phishing techniques or improve existing techniques, but also enable our understanding on the limitations of the existing techniques.},

We develop novel techniques like dynamic stacking, pseudo random placement, variable object pose, distractor noise etc. which not only aid in diversifying the synthetic data but also help in improving the overall object detection mAP by more than 40%. The synthetic images, generated using Blender-Python API, are clustered in a variety of configurations to cater to the diversity of real scenes. These datasets are then utilized to train TensorFlow implementations of state-of-the-art deep neural networks like Faster-RCNN, R-FCN, and SSD and their performance is tested on real scenes.

abstract={We explore the robustness and usability of moving-image object recognition (video) CAPTCHAS, designing and implementing automated attacks based on computer vision techniques. Our approach is suitable for broad classes of moving-image CAPTCHAS involving rigid objects. We first present an attack that defeats instances of such a CAPTCHA (NuCaptcha) representing the state-of-the-art, involving dynamic text strings called codewords. We then consider design modifications to mitigate the attacks (e.g., overlapping characters more closely, randomly changing the font of individual characters, or even randomly varying the number of characters in the codeword). We implement the modified CAPTCHAS and test if designs modified for greater robustness maintain usability. Our lab-based studies show that the modified captchas fail to offer viable usability, even when the captcha strength is reduced below acceptable targets. Worse yet, our GPU-based implementation shows that our automated approach can decode these captchas faster than humans can, and we can do so at a relatively low cost of roughly 50 cents per 1,000 captchas solved based on Amazon EC2 rates circa 2012. To further demonstrate the challenges in designing usable captchas, we also implement and test another variant of moving text strings using the known emerging images concept. This variant is resilient to our attacks and also offers similar usability to commercially available approaches. We explain why fundamental elements of the emerging images idea resist our current attack where others fail.},

pages={661-685},
abstract={Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are some of the most devastating attacks against Web applications. A large number of these attacks aim to exhaust the network bandwidth of the server, and are called network layer DDoS attacks. They are volumetric attacks and rely on a large volume of network layer packets to throttle the bandwidth. However, as time passed, network infrastructure became more robust and defenses against network layer attacks also became more advanced. Recently, DDoS attacks have started targeting the application layer. Unlike network layer attacks, these attacks can be carried out with a relatively low attack volume. They also utilize legitimate application layer requests, which makes it difficult for existing defense mechanisms to detect them. These attacks target a wide variety of resources at the application layer and can bring a server down much faster, and with much more stealth, than network layer DDoS attacks. Over the past decade, research on application layer DDoS attacks has focused on a few classes of these attacks. This paper attempts to explore the entire spectrum of application layer DDoS attacks using critical features that aid in understanding how these attacks can be executed. defense mechanisms against the different classes of attacks are also discussed with special emphasis on the features that aid in the detection of different classes of attacks. Such a discussion is expected to help researchers understand why a particular group of features are useful in detecting a particular class of attacks.},

In this paper, we consider a type of attack in which a malicious RFID reader could arbitrarily modify the tags via standard commands, e.g., IDs or other data in the memory. To deal with this type of attack, we propose a physical-layer RF signal based reader authentication solution, namely Arbitrator, that involves passively listening on RF channels, analyzing the communication signals, identifying unauthorized readers and jamming the commands from such readers. Our solution does not need to modify RFID devices or the underlying communication standards, hence fully compatible with the existing RFID infrastructure. In this study, we have implemented a prototype Arbitrator over the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) platform, and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our results show that Arbitrator can detect unauthorized RFID readers with high accuracy, and thus effectively diminish the unauthorized access attacks.},

The approach uses the two-stage detection mode which consists of host detection and guest detection, combines shape test and regularity test to extract the attack features from hosts and guests, and uses pattern recognition techniques to distinguish the attack VMs from the legitimate VMs. At last, a series of experiments are conducted, and the experimental results show that CSDA is capable of detecting them in cloud effectively.},

abstract={A major threat to the Internet infrastructure and, more broadly, to its culture is posed by DDoS attacks. To mitigate their impact, detection should preferably occur close to the attack origin, e.g., at home-routers. However, these devices typically have limited resources and an approach that relies on packet inspection does not bode well with such devices.We propose a lightweight approach for DDoS detection that solely employs network interface byte and packet counts. To detect attacks with such a limited amount of information, our key insight consists in training classifiers to make use of workload data from 1,823 home-users augmented with attacks generated in a controlled environment. In our experiments, we selected seven attack vectors generated using Mirai and BASHLITE malwares. We then conduct a device-agnostic detection of attacks vectors, obtaining F1 scores typically higher than 0.99. To cope with the evolving nature of DDoS attacks, we also report results indicating the detection power of the proposed methodology when different attack vectors are used for training and testing.},

abstract={In recent years, deep neural network (DNN) approaches prove to be useful in many machine learning tasks, including classification. However, small perturbations that are carefully crafted by attackers can lead to the misclassification of the images. Previous studies have shown that adversarial subspaces lie off (but close to) the data submanifold and detection techniques based on the distributional difference between adversarial and normal samples have been proposed. These distribution-based detection techniques achieve excellent performance in characterizing adversarial samples. In this paper, We propose W-PGD to generate adversarial samples close to normal data distribution to bypass those detecting mechanisms. We trained a neural network WassNet to estimate the difference between two distributions using Wasserstein distance and use the gradient of WassNet to constrain the Wasserstein distance between adversarial and normal samples' distribution. Our experiment shows that W-PGD can effectively decrease the detection rate of distribution-based detection techniques and generate adversarial samples with constrained Wasserstein distance.},

abstract={This article addresses the problem of semantic segmentation with limited cross-modality data in large-scale urban scenes. Most prior works have attempted to address this issue by using multimodal deep neural networks (DNNs). However, their ability to effectively blending different properties across multimodalities and robustly learning representations from complex scenes remains limited, particularly in the absence of sufficient and well-annotated training images. This leads to a challenge related to cross-modality learning with multimodal DNNs. To this end, we introduce two novel plug-and-play units in the network: self-generative adversarial networks (GANs) module and mutual-GANs module, to learn perturbation-insensitive feature representations and to eliminate the gap between multimodalities, respectively, yielding more effective and robust information transfer. Furthermore, a patchwise progressive training strategy is devised to enable effective network learning with limited samples. We evaluate the proposed network on two multimodal (hyperspectral and multispectral) overhead image data sets and achieve a significant improvement in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Identifying sensitive user inputs is a prerequisite for privacy protection in mobile applications. When it comes to today's program analysis systems, however, only those data that go through well-defined system Application Program Interface (system controlled resources) can be automatically labeled. In this paper, we show that this conventional approach is far from adequate, as most sensitive inputs are actually entered by the user at an app's runtime. In this paper, we inspect 13,072 top apps from Google Play, and find that 38.69% of them involve sensitive user inputs. Just like system controlled resources, these data are also exposed to a series of privacy leakage threats. For these sensitive user inputs, manually marking them involves a lot of efforts, impeding a large-scale, automated analysis of apps to defend against potential privacy leakage. To address this important issue, we present UIPicker, an adaptable framework for automatic identification of sensitive user inputs as the first step. UIPicker is designed to detect the semantic information within the application layout resources and the program code, and further analyze it for the locations where security-critical information may show up. This approach can support a variety of existing security analysis on mobile apps. We evaluate our approach over randomly selected popular apps on Google Play. UIPicker is able to accurately label sensitive user inputs most of the time, with 94.0% precision and 96.0% recall.},

abstract={The technique of transforming voices in order to hide the real identity of a speaker is called voice disguise, among which automatic voice disguise (AVD) by modifying the spectral and temporal characteristics of voices with miscellaneous algorithms are easily conducted with softwares accessible to the public. AVD has posed great threat to both human listening and automatic speaker verification (ASV). In this paper, we have found that ASV is not only a victim of AVD but could be a tool to beat some simple types of AVD. Firstly, three types of AVD, pitch scaling, vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) and voice conversion (VC), are introduced as representative methods. State-of-the-art ASV methods are subsequently utilized to objectively evaluate the impact of AVD on ASV by equal error rates (EER). Moreover, an approach to restore disguised voice to its original version is proposed by minimizing a function of ASV scores w.r.t. restoration parameters. Experiments are then conducted on disguised voices from Voxceleb, a dataset recorded in real-world noisy scenario. The results have shown that, for the voice disguise by pitch scaling, the proposed approach obtains an EER around 7% comparing to the 30% EER of a recently proposed baseline using the ratio of fundamental frequencies. The proposed approach generalizes well to restore the disguise with nonlinear frequency warping in VTLN by reducing its EER from 34.3% to 18.5%. However, it is difficult to restore the source speakers in VC by our approach, where more complex forms of restoration functions or other paralinguistic cues might be necessary to restore the nonlinear transform in VC. Finally, contrastive visualization on ASV features with and without restoration illustrate the role of the proposed approach in an intuitive way.},

abstract={It is becoming increasingly clear that mitochondria play an important role in neural function. Recent studies show mitochondrial morphology to be crucial to cellular physiology and synaptic function and a link between mitochondrial defects and neuro-degenerative diseases is strongly suspected. Electron microscopy (EM), with its very high resolution in all three directions, is one of the key tools to look more closely into these issues but the huge amounts of data it produces make automated analysis necessary. State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms designed to operate on natural 2-D images tend to perform poorly when applied to EM data for a number of reasons. First, the sheer size of a typical EM volume renders most modern segmentation schemes intractable. Furthermore, most approaches ignore important shape cues, relying only on local statistics that easily become confused when confronted with noise and textures inherent in the data. Finally, the conventional assumption that strong image gradients always correspond to object boundaries is violated by the clutter of distracting membranes. In this work, we propose an automated graph partitioning scheme that addresses these issues. It reduces the computational complexity by operating on supervoxels instead of voxels, incorporates shape features capable of describing the 3-D shape of the target objects, and learns to recognize the distinctive appearance of true boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to segment mitochondria at a performance level close to that of a human annotator, and outperforms a state-of-the-art 3-D segmentation technique.},

abstract={Virtualization is a foundational key to cloud computing that allows sharing single physical host, resources, and application among multiple users. Virtual cloud infrastructure is vulnerable to distributed denial of service attack, in particular, SYN flood attack which exhausts the server resources and makes it unavailable to the legitimate user. In the clouds, this type of attack impact can extend to a large number of resources which lead to doubling the losses. This paper discusses the SYN flood attack in virtual cloud and detects it based on new features that extracted from TCP/IP header. Hence, different machine learning methods such as neural network, naïve base, decision tree and k-means are used to observe the performance. The results show that the machine learning algorithms proved an efficient performance in classifying and detecting SYN flood attack with extracted features.},

abstract={WordPress (WP) is one of the most popular PHP-based content management system (CMS) used for creating websites. WP became popular due to its many dynamic content management features including Pingback through XMLRPC, which sends a notification when other websites link to any one of the WP contents. However, WP XMLRPC Pingback does not have a mechanism to limit and validate whether any Pingback request actually originated from a linked post. Our experiment demonstrated that an attack with as few as 5 online WP websites is sufficient to take down a victim's WP-based website. The proposed countermeasure for this type of attack has then been shown to successfully prevent HTTP-GET attacks at the source.},

abstract={Wireless networks are very significant in the present world owing to their widespread use and its application in domains like disaster management, smart cities, IoT etc. A wireless network is made up of a group of wireless nodes that communicate with each other without using any formal infrastructure. The topology of the wireless network is not fixed and it can vary. The huge increase in the number of wireless devices is a challenge owing to the limited availability of wireless spectrum. Opportunistic spectrum access by Cognitive radio enables the efficient usage of limited spectrum resources. The unused channels assigned to the primary users may go waste in idle time. Cognitive radio systems will sense the unused channel space and assigns it temporarily for secondary users. This paper discusses about the recent trends in the two most important aspects of Cognitive radio namely spectrum sensing and security.},

abstract={Online surveys are a popular mechanism for performing market research in exchange for monetary compensation. Unfortunately, fraudulent survey websites are similarly rising in popularity among cyber-criminals as a means for executing social engineering attacks. In addition to the sizable population of users that participate in online surveys as a secondary revenue stream, unsuspecting users who search the web for free content or access codes to commercial software can also be exposed to survey scams. This occurs through redirection to websites that ask the user to complete a survey in order to receive the promised content or a reward. In this paper, we present SURVEYLANCE, the first system that automatically identifies survey scams using machine learning techniques. Our evaluation demonstrates that SURVEYLANCE works well in practice by identifying 8,623 unique websites involved in online survey attacks. We show that SURVEYLANCE is suitable for assisting human analysts in survey scam detection at scale. Our work also provides the first systematic analysis of the survey scam ecosystem by investigating the capabilities of these services, mapping all the parties involved in the ecosystem, and quantifying the consequences to users that are exposed to these services. Our analysis reveals that a large number of survey scams are easily reachable through the Alexa top 30K websites, and expose users to a wide range of security issues including identity fraud, deceptive advertisements, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), malicious extensions, and malware.},

abstract={The exploit kits (EKs) are used by attackers to distribute malware automatically and silently. Existing approaches to EKs detection usually need to perform dynamic analysis on the content contained in the network traffic, which requires dumping all the network traffic and thus causes high detection overhead. Although some approaches detect EKs based on static analysis, they usually fail to restore the complete attack path because of the obstruction set by the attackers. In this paper, we propose an approach that can detect EKs based on only information extracted by static analysis. Our method builds a graph for web sessions and extracts features from the graph to perform EKs detection. The built graph catches important structural characteristics of the interaction during EK attacks that were not revealed in existing methods, with which EKs can be detected with high accuracy. The experiments show that our method works well in both the ground-truth datasets and the latest practical cases. Our method can also identify the malicious websites concealed in EKs, which can further improve the efficiency of analysis.},

abstract={Face morphing attack images are built to be verifiable to multiple identities. Associating such images to identity documents leads to building faulty identity links, causing vulnerabilities in security critical processes. Recent works have studied the face morphing attack detection performance over variations in morphing approaches, pointing out low generalization. This work introduces a multi-detector fusion solution that aims at gaining both, accuracy and generalization over different morphing types. This is performed by fusing classification scores produced by detectors trained on databases with variations in morphing type and image pairing protocols. This work develop and evaluate the proposed solution along with baseline solutions by building a database with three different pairing protocols and two different morphing approaches. This proposed solution successfully lead to decreasing the Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate at 1.0% Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate from 15.7% and 3.0% of the best performing single detector to 2.7% and 0.0%, respectively on two face morphing techniques, pointing out a highly generalized performance.},

year={2021},
volume={},

pages={1347-1359},
abstract={Android apps include third-party native libraries to increase performance and to reuse functionality. Native code is directly executed from apps through the Java Native Interface or the Android Native Development Kit. Android developers add precompiled native libraries to their projects, enabling their use. Unfortunately, developers often struggle or simply neglect to update these libraries in a timely manner. This results in the continuous use of outdated native libraries with unpatched security vulnerabilities years after patches became available. To further understand such phenomena, we study the security updates in native libraries in the most popular 200 free apps on Google Play from Sept. 2013 to May 2020. A core difficulty we face in this study is the identification of libraries and their versions. Developers often rename or modify libraries, making their identification challenging. We create an approach called LibRARIAN (LibRAry veRsion IdentificAtioN) that accurately identifies native libraries and their versions as found in Android apps based on our novel similarity metric bin2sim. LibRARIAN leverages different features extracted from libraries based on their metadata and identifying strings in read-only sections. We discovered 53/200 popular apps (26.5%) with vulnerable versions with known CVEs between Sept. 2013 and May 2020, with 14 of those apps remaining vulnerable. We find that app developers took, on average, 528.71±40.20 days to apply security patches, while library developers release a security patch after 54.59 ± 8.12 days-a 10 times slower rate of update.},

abstract={We study the individuality of the human voice with respect to a widely used feature representation of speech utterances, namely, the i-vector model. As a first step toward this goal, we compare and contrast uniqueness measures proposed for different biometric modalities. Then, we introduce a new uniqueness measure that evaluates the entropy of i-vectors while taking into account speaker level variations. Our measure operates in the discrete feature space and relies on accurate estimation of the distribution of i-vectors. Therefore, i-vectors are quantized while ensuring that both the quantized and original representations yield similar speaker verification performance. Uniqueness estimates are obtained from two newly generated datasets and the public VoxCeleb dataset. The first custom dataset contains more than one and a half million speech samples of 20,741 speakers obtained from TEDx Talks videos. The second one includes over twenty one thousand speech samples from 1,595 actors that are extracted from movie dialogues. Using this data, we analyzed how several factors, such as the number of speakers, number of samples per speaker, sample durations, and diversity of utterances affect uniqueness estimates. Most notably, we determine that the discretization of i-vectors does not cause a reduction in speaker recognition performance. Our results show that the degree of distinctiveness offered by i-vector-based representation may reach 43–70 bits considering 5-second long speech samples; however, under less constrained variations in speech, uniqueness estimates are found to reduce by around 30 bits. We also find that doubling the sample duration increases the distinctiveness of the i-vector representation by around 20 bits.},

Feature selection is a vital step in data analysis that often reduces dataset dimensionality by eliminating irrelevant and/or redundant attributes to simplify the learning process or improve outcomes' quality. This research critically analyses different filter methods based on ranking procedures (Information Gain (IG), Chi-square (CHI), V-score, Fisher Score, mRMR, Va and ReliefF) and identifies possible challenges that arise. We particularly concentrate on how threshold determination can affect results of different filter methods based on ranked scores. We show that this issue is vital, especially in the era of big data in which users deal with attributes in the magnitudes of tens of thousands with only a limited number of instances.},

Unfortunately, while re-evaluating the state of the art of the shot boundary detection, we found that they need to be improved because the characteristics of consumer-produced videos have changed significantly since the introduction of mobile gadgets, such as smartphones, tablets and outdoor activity purposed cameras, and video editing software has been evolving rapidly. In this paper, we evaluate the best-known approach on a contemporary, publicly accessible corpus, and present a method that achieves better performance, particularly on soft transitions. Our method combines color histograms with key point feature matching to extract comprehensive frame information. Two similarity metrics, one for individual frames and one for sets of frames, are defined based on graph cuts. These metrics are formed into temporal feature vectors on which a SVM is trained to perform the final segmentation. The evaluation on said "modern" corpus of relatively short videos yields a performance of 92% recall (at 89% precision) overall, compared to 69% (91%) of the best-known method.},

Our attack is proved to perform better compared to the state-of-the-art attacks. Experiment results also show that the timing information is very useful for classification. Furthermore, we collect our own traffic traces between client and entry node, and transform them into three extraction layers: TCP, TLS and Tor cell layer, and meanwhile record Tor's cell log at the entry node. The experimental results show that the data of the cell layer is the most divisible among the three layers. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the adversary at the entry node has an advantage over the one who just listens to traffic between client and entry node.},

abstract={Intrusion detection has been an important countermeasure to secure computing infrastructures from malicious attacks. To improve detection performance and reduce bias towards frequent attacks, this paper proposes a two-step hybrid method based on binary classification and k-NN technique. Step 1 employs several binary classifiers and one aggregation module to effectively detect the exact classes of network connections. After step 1, the connections whose classes are uncertain are sent to step 2 to further determine their classes by the k-NN algorithm. Step 2 is based on the outcomes of step 1 and yields a beneficial supplement to step 1. By combining the two steps, the proposed method achieves reliable results on the NSL-KDD data set. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in comparison with five supervised learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines with respect to various evaluation criteria. In particular, for U2R and R2L attacks, the F1-scores of the proposed method are much higher than those of baselines. Furthermore, comparisons with some recent hybrid approaches are also listed. The results illustrate that the proposed method is competitive.},

abstract={This work proposes a privacy-protection framework for an important application called outsourced media search. This scenario involves a data owner, a client, and an untrusted server, where the owner outsources a search service to the server. Due to lack of trust, the privacy of the client and the owner should be protected. The framework relies on multimedia hashing and symmetric encryption. It requires involved parties to participate in a privacy-enhancing protocol. Additional processing steps are carried out by the owner and the client: (i) before outsourcing low-level media features to the server, the owner has to one-way hash them, and partially encrypt each hash-value; (ii) the client completes the similarity search by re-ranking the most similar candidates received from the server. One-way hashing and encryption add ambiguity to data and make it difficult for the server to infer contents from database items and queries, so the privacy of both the owner and the client is enforced. The proposed framework realizes trade-offs among strength of privacy enforcement, quality of search, and complexity, because the information loss can be tuned during hashing and encryption. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the flexibility of the framework.},

abstract={Side-channel attack is a known security risk to smart cards, and there have been efforts by smart card manufacturers to incorporate side-channel attack countermeasures. In this paper, we study a widely used smart card that uses the 3DES algorithm. First, a platform is setup to extract the power consumption information from the electromagnetic wave. Based on the findings from the initial analysis, we determine that the card is equipped with a “head and tail protection” mechanism. Second, a chosen-plaintext power analysis with a complexity of 216 is proposed, which is designed to recover the second round key from the power leakage in the third round. Then, a slicing-collision-algebraic attack is presented, which decreases the complexity to 26 rapidly. The experiments show that after collecting 20000 power traces (in approximately 200 s), only $2^{6} \times 8$ key guesses and another 177 searches (about 300 seconds) are sufficient in recovering the 56-bit source keys of DES successfully. In other words, we demonstrate how the security of the 3DES card can be easily compromised, using side-channel attacks. Finally, we recommend that the head and tail protection should extend to the first and last four rounds, at the minimal, in order to be side-channel attack resilience.},

abstract={Malware and botnets are one of the most serious threats to today's Internet security. In this paper, we characterise the so-called &Miner Botnet”. It received major media attention after massive distributed denial of service attacks against a wide range of German and Russian websites, mainly during August and September 2011. We use our insights on this botnet to outline current botnet-related money-making concepts and to show that multiple activities of this botnet are actually centred on the virtual anonymised currency Bitcoin, thus justifying the name. Furthermore, we provide a binary-level analysis of the malware's design and components to illustrate the modularity of the previously mentioned concepts. We give an overview of the structure of the command-and-control protocol as well as of the botnet's architecture. Both centralised as well as distributed infrastructure aspects realised through peer-to-peer are present to run the botnet, the latter for increasing its resiliency. Finally, we provide the results of our ongoing tracking efforts that started in September 2011, focusing on the development of the botnet's size and geographic distribution. In addition we point out the challenge that is generally connected with size measurements of botnets due to the reachability of individual nodes and the persistence of IP addresses over time.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose Code-Bridged Classifier (CBC), a framework for making a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) robust against adversarial attacks without increasing or even by decreasing the overall models' computational complexity. More specifically, we propose a stacked encoder-convolutional model, in which the input image is first encoded by the encoder module of a denoising auto-encoder, and then the resulting latent representation (without being decoded) is fed to a reduced complexity CNN for image classification. We illustrate that this network not only is more robust to adversarial examples but also has a significantly lower computational complexity when compared to the prior art defenses.},

In this paper we introduce the first security type system that enforces session security on a core model of web applications, focusing in particular on server-side code. We showcase the expressiveness of our type system by analyzing the session management logic of HotCRP, Moodle, and phpMyAdmin, unveiling novel security flaws that have been acknowledged by software developers.},

abstract={Due to their specific features, blockchains have become popular in recent years. Blockchains are layered systems where security is a critical factor for their success. The main focus of this work is to systematize knowledge about security and privacy issues of blockchains. To this end, we propose a security reference architecture based on models that demonstrate the stacked hierarchy of various threats as well as threat-risk assessment using ISO/IEC 15408. In contrast to the previous surveys [23], [88], [11], we focus on the categorization of security vulnerabilities based on their origins and using the proposed architecture we present existing prevention and mitigation techniques. The scope of our work mainly covers aspects related to the nature of blockchains, while we mention operational security issues and countermeasures only tangentially.},

pages={175194-175204},
abstract={Distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS) are primarily deployed across the network to monitor, detect, and report anomalies, as well as to respond in real-time. Predominantly, an IDS is equipped with a set of rules that it needs to infer to be able to perform efficient detection. However, reducing the generation of false alarms is a major challenge in any IDS implementation. Additionally, the sheer number of IoT devices that generate alarms in a moderately large sensor network may be overwhelming. In order to reduce alarms, this paper contributes to the field by proposing an original framework that limits the number of generated messages without compromising detection accuracy. The primary idea is to exploit mid-level nodes called collectors where similar alerts are collected and analyzed independently. Priority is assigned to each alert and similar alerts are fused to respective collectors for more informed decision making. In addition, Kademlia based Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is used for efficient alert transportation and distributed fusion of similar alerts. In order to minimize false alarm rate, event correlation is used to find similarity between events fused by different detection sensors. The framework is implemented in a fog-based environment to assess and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system in edge network. The architecture is evaluated with the recognized DARPA 1999 dataset; the reported results show that the proposed technique reduces message generation by 62% while achieving false positive accuracy over 80%.},

abstract={In this paper, we focus on Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) attack on state-of-the-art person re-identification (Re-ID) methods. Existing UAP methods usually compute a perturbation image and add it to the images of interest. Such a simple constant form greatly limits the attack power. To address this problem, we extend the formulation of UAP to a polynomial form and propose the Polynomial Universal Adversarial Perturbation (PUAP). Unlike traditional UAP methods which only rely on the additive perturbation signal, the proposed PUAP consists of both an additive perturbation and a multiplicative modulation factor. The additive perturbation produces the fundamental component of the signal, while the multiplicative factor modulates the perturbation signal in line with the unit impulse pattern of the input image. Moreover, we introduce a Pearson correlation coefficient loss to generate universal perturbations, for disrupting the outputs of person Re-ID models. Extensive experiments on DukeMTMC-reID, Market-1501, and MARS show that the proposed method can efficiently improve the attack performance, especially when the magnitude of UAP is constrained to a relatively small value.},

abstract={The flexibility and mobility of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) have made them increasingly popular in a wide range of use cases. To protect these networks, security protocols have been developed to protect routing and application data. However, these protocols only protect routes or communication, not both. Both secure routing and communication security protocols must be implemented to provide full protection. The use of communication security protocols originally developed for wireline and WiFi networks can also place a heavy burden on the limited network resources of a MANET. To address these issues, a novel secure framework (SUPERMAN) is proposed. The framework is designed to allow existing network and routing protocols to perform their functions, whilst providing node authentication, access control, and communication security mechanisms. This paper presents a novel security framework for MANETs, SUPERMAN. Simulation results comparing SUPERMAN with IPsec, SAODV, and SOLSR are provided to demonstrate the proposed frameworks suitability for wireless communication security.},

abstract={Visual localization algorithms have achieved significant improvements in performance thanks to recent advances in camera technology and vision-based techniques. However, there remains one critical caveat: all current approaches that are based on image retrieval currently scale at best linearly with the size of the environment with respect to both storage, and consequentially in most approaches, query time. This limitation severely curtails the capability of autonomous systems in a wide range of compute, power, storage, size, weight or cost constrained applications such as drones. In this work, we present a novel binary tree encoding approach for visual localization which can serve as an alternative for existing quantization and indexing techniques. The proposed tree structure allows us to derive a compressed training scheme that achieves sub-linearity in both required storage and inference time. The encoding memory can be easily configured to satisfy different storage constraints. Moreover, our approach is amenable to an optional sequence filtering mechanism to further improve the localization results, while maintaining the same amount of storage. Our system is entirely agnostic to the front-end descriptors, allowing it to be used on top of recent state-of-the-art image representations. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under limited storage constraints.},

pages={177932-177943},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel robust visual classification framework that uses double quantization (dquant) to defend against adversarial examples in a specific attack scenario called “subsequent adversarial examples” where test images are injected with adversarial noise. The proposed system can remove the adversarial noise completely on this particular attack scenario. First, we analyze the potential sources of adversarial noise and classify adversarial examples into three classes. We then propose a novel effective solution, dquant, to target a specific class of adversarial examples. The first quantization is 1-bit dithering applied to both training and test images. The second one is linear quantization, which is applied to test images just before being inputted to a model to remove any adversarial noise. The linear quantizer guarantees that original 1-bit test images will be restored regardless of adversarial noise distance, and, therefore, dquant maintains identical accuracy whether or not the model is under attack. The results show that dquant achieves comparable accuracy, 85.28% on the CIFAR-10 and 94.99% on the Oxford-IIIT Pet datasets against three state-of-the-art adversaries with even a previously untested maximum adversarial distance of 64.},

abstract={The outsourcing of security management has become increasingly attractive for many organisations, this may be the only path available due to the lack of in-house expertise and infrastructure requirements. Deployment of contemporary systems are no longer the essential effective strategies in cybersecurity threat management. The managed security service providers offering a raft of essential mature security monitoring and management capabilities; security information and event management, strategic management of organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk and compliance with regulations (GRC) will become the option for many organisations. The need for embedding collaborative visualisation in cybersecurity systems are on the rise not only because intelligent visual data displays facilitate the highest possible situation awareness transmitted from the computer to the human but also as it provides the opportunity of collaboration with other experts in a timely manner. It facilitates analysts to acquire a higher number of accurate insights of incidents. Regardless of whether outsourced or on-prem, this will cost organisations a greater amount of money. This paper takes on the challenge proactively by exploring how to establish a virtualised, cyber-security operations centre (C-SOC) that provides information on situation awareness for managing cybersecurity through utilising highly stable open-source network security tools cost-efficiently. The infrastructure development is performed by integrating these tools within a VM networking environment.},

abstract={The past few years have witnessed the compelling applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in our daily life. The explosive growth of the number of IoT devices also presents a great challenge in network security, especially the DDoS attack. Current DDoS defense mechanisms adopted out-of-band architecture, which is accomplished by a process that receives monitoring data from routers and switches, then analyzes that flow data to detect attacks. However, facing IoT devices growing rapidly, this out-of-band architecture confronted with limited processing capacity, bandwidth resources, and service assurance problems. Recently, with the development of the programming switch, it opens up new possibilities for in-network DDoS detection, where the detection algorithms could be directly implemented inside the routers and switches. Benefit from switch processing performance, the in-network mechanism could achieve high scalability and line speed performance. Therefore, in this article, we design a machine learning-based in-network DDoS detection framework. We implement the lightweight variational Bayes algorithm in each switch to detect the anomaly traffic. Besides, considering the shortage of training data in each switch, a centralized platform is introduced to synchronize parameters among distributed switches to realize collaborative learning. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to some state-of-the-art schemes.},

abstract={Video surveillance systems are now widely deployed to improve our lives by enhancing safety, security, health monitoring and business intelligence. This has motivated extensive research into automated video analysis. Nevertheless, there is a gap between the focus of contemporary research, and the needs of end users of video surveillance systems. Many existing benchmarks and methodologies focus on narrowly defined problems in detection, tracking, re-identification or recognition. In contrast, end users face higher-level problems such as long-term monitoring of identities in order to build a picture of a person's activity across the course of a day, producing usage statistics of a particular area of space, and that these capabilities should be robust to challenges such as change of clothing. To achieve this effectively requires less widely studied capabilities such as spatio-temporal reasoning about people identities and locations within a space partially observed by multiple cameras over an extended time period. To bridge this gap between research and required capabilities, we propose a new dataset LIMA that encompasses the challenges of monitoring a typical home / office environment. LIMA contains 4.5 hours of RGB-D video from three cameras monitoring a four room house. To reflect the challenges of a realistic practical application, the dataset includes clothes changes and visitors to ensure the global reasoning is a realistic open-set problem. In addition to raw data, we provide identity annotation for benchmarking, and tracking results from a contemporary RGB-D tracker - thus allowing focus on the higher level monitoring problems.},

abstract={The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting every single object to the Internet with the purpose to automate every aspect of daily life. The IoT relies heavily on wireless low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) that collect information from the physical world and send the measurements to data aggregation and processing nodes. Most LLNs operate in the non-licensed industrial, scientific, and medical radio band, which is shared by a considerable number of systems. Coexisting wireless systems cause interference to each other, limiting their achievable performance. Multichannel communications enable frequency diversity, which in turn provides robustness against interference as well as increased network capacity. There is a considerable interest in multichannel medium access control (MAC) protocols for LLNs, including an evolving standard for the MAC layer of LLNs. In this paper, we review the latest advances in the topic and introduce a new classification framework for multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs. While our framework builds on previous review and classification studies, it adds aspects of a MAC protocol that reflect its interactions with the surrounding network stack. Seeing the resource constraints of the LLN devices, the study of such interactions-which is missing in prior classification efforts-can be the key for improving future designs. Relevant protocols published since 2006 are discussed and classified using the presented framework, including the recent multichannel MAC protocols for LLNs, such as the latest version of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for time slotted channel hopping.},

Consequently, the complexity and strength of security attacks have increased in the recent past making the detection or prevention of sabotage a global challenge. From the security and privacy perspectives, this paper presents a comprehensive detail on the core and enabling technologies, which are used to build the 5G security model; network softwarization security, PHY (Physical) layer security and 5G privacy concerns, among others. Additionally, the paper includes discussion on security monitoring and management of 5G networks. This paper also evaluates the related security measures and standards of core 5G technologies by resorting to different standardization bodies and provide a brief overview of 5G standardization security forces. Furthermore, the key projects of international significance, in line with the security concerns of 5G and beyond are also presented.

abstract={Named data networking (NDN) has emerged as a future networking architecture having the potential to replace the Internet. In order to do so, the NDN needs to cope with inherent problems of the Internet, such as attacks that cause information leakage from an enterprise. Since NDN has not yet been deployed on a large scale, it is currently unknown how such attacks can occur, let alone what countermeasures can be taken against them. In this paper, we first show that information leakage in NDN can be caused by malware inside an enterprise, which uses steganography to produce malicious interest names encoding confidential information. We investigate such attacks by utilizing a content name dataset based on uniform resource locators (URLs) collected by a Web crawler. Our main contribution is a name filter based on anomaly detection that takes the dataset as input and classifies a name in the Interest as legitimate or not. Our evaluation shows that the malware can exploit the path part in the URL-based NDN name to create malicious names, thus, information leakage in the NDN cannot be prevented completely. However, we show for the first time that our filter can dramatically choke the leakage throughput causing the malware to be 137 times less efficient at leaking information. This finding opens up an interesting avenue of research that could result in a safer future networking architecture.},

abstract={Distributed denial of service attacks threaten the security and health of the Internet. Remediation relies on up-to-date and accurate attack signatures. Signature-based detection is relatively inexpensive computationally. Yet, signatures are inflexible when small variations exist in the attack vector. Attackers exploit this rigidity by altering their attacks to bypass the signatures. Our previous work revealed a critical problem with conventional machine learning models. Conventional models are unable to generalize on the temporal nature of network flow data to classify attacks. We thus explored the use of deep learning techniques on real flow data. We found that a variety of attacks could be identified with high accuracy compared to previous approaches. We show that a convolutional neural network can be implemented for this problem that is suitable for large volumes of data while maintaining useful levels of accuracy.},

abstract={In this survey, we present a comprehensive list of major known security threats within a cognitive radio network (CRN) framework. We classify attack techniques based on the type of attacker, namely exogenous (external) attackers, intruding malicious nodes and greedy cognitive radios (CRs). We further discuss threats related to infrastructure-based CRNs as well as infrastructure-less networks. Besides the short-term effects of attacks over CRN performance, we also discuss the often ignored longer term behavioral changes that are enforced by such attacks via the learning capability of CRN. After elaborating on various attack strategies, we discuss potential solutions to combat those attacks. An overview of robust CR communications is also presented. We finally elaborate on future research directions pertinent to CRN security. We hope this survey paper can provide the insight and the roadmap for future research efforts in the emerging field of CRN security.},

abstract={Over 55% of the world's websites run on Content Management Systems (CMS). Unfortunately, this huge user population has made CMS-based websites a high-profile target for hackers. Worse still, the vast majority of the website hosting industry has shifted to a "backup and restore" model of security, which relies on error-prone AV scanners to prompt users to roll back to a pre-infection nightly snapshot. This research had the opportunity to study these nightly backups for over 300,000 unique production websites. In doing so, we measured the attack landscape of CMS-based websites and assessed the effectiveness of the backup and restore protection scheme. To our surprise, we found that the evolution of tens of thousands of attacks exhibited clear long-lived multi-stage attack patterns. We now propose TARDIS, an automated provenance inference technique, which enables the investigation and remediation of CMS-targeting attacks based on only the nightly backups already being collected by website hosting companies. With the help of our industry collaborator, we applied TARDIS to the nightly backups of those 300K websites and found 20,591 attacks which lasted from 6 to 1,694 days, some of which were still yet to be detected.},

abstract={Secure QoS routing algorithms are a fundamental part of wireless networks that aim to provide services with QoS and security guarantees. In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), vehicles perform routing functions, and at the same time act as end-systems thus routing control messages are transmitted unprotected over wireless channels. The QoS of the entire network could be degraded by an attack on the routing process, and manipulation of the routing control messages. In this paper, we propose a novel secure and reliable multi-constrained QoS aware routing algorithm for VANETs. We employ the ant colony optimisation (ACO) technique to compute feasible routes in VANETs subject to multiple QoS constraints determined by the data traffic type. Moreover, we extend the VANET-oriented evolving graph (VoEG) model to perform plausibility checks on the routing control messages exchanged among vehicles. Simulation results show that the QoS can be guaranteed while applying security mechanisms to ensure a reliable and robust routing service.},

Despite the utility and advantages of UAVs, they may lead to major security breaches in the context of hardware, software, and communication channel, due their ease of use and availability. UAVs are vulnerable to various types of attacks such as spoofing, false data injection, jamming, fuzzing, availability, confidentiality, and integrity attacks. To overcome these security threats, researchers have been investigating strong security protocols to keep UAVs safe from the attackers. Nevertheless, there are many flaws in the developed protocols which can be exploited by hackers. Therefore, it is becomes crucial to study and analyze the existing security protocols used in UAVs to discover and address their vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The purpose of this study is to explore the vulnerabilities in the security protocols and propose guidelines to improve the security and provide future research directions.},

abstract={Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) represent the interactions of genes in living organisms, which have evolved over millions of years to provide a near-optimal structure for rapid adaptation to the environment. On the other hand, robustness in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a critical factor that largely depends on their topology and how quickly the network can recover from node and link failures. This article proposes a novel approach to design robust WSNs by exploiting GRNs. Specifically, we build bio-inspired WSNs based on the topology of GRNs. Our approach embeds the physical communication graph of the WSN into the GRN graph under the optimization criterion of minimizing the interference between different nodes. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to identify data collection points (i.e., sinks) and improve robustness by maximizing the expansion of the network. Through an analytical evaluation, we show that our bio-inspired graph embedding approach leads to robust WSNs which preserve the structural properties of GRNs.},

abstract={Network slicing, a key enabler for future wireless networks, divides a physical network into multiple logical networks that can be dynamically created and configured. In current IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, the only form of network configuration is a rule-based optimization of few parameters. Future access points (APs) are expected to have self-organizational capabilities, able to deal with large configuration spaces in order to dynamically configure each slice. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve promising results in highly dynamic and complex environments without the need for an operating model, by learning the optimal strategy after interacting with the environment. However, since the number of possible slice configurations is huge, achieving the optimal strategy requires an exhaustive learning period that might yield an outdated slice configuration. In this paper, we propose a fast-learning DRL model that can dynamically optimize the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks without expert knowledge. Enhanced with an off-line learning step, the proposed approach is able to achieve the optimal slice configuration with a fast convergence, which is attractive for dynamic scenarios.},

abstract={ID cards are uniquely linked to one individual via a printed or electronically provided facial image. Even though the face is treated as universal and distinctive characteristic, twins can weaken this distinctiveness because of their biological similarity. Also, humans might falsely recognise an unknown person as a friend - colloquially named a Dop-pelgänger. Recently it was demonstrated that this biological effect of similar data subjects can be purposefully established between two individuals in order to improve the vulnerability of the so-called morphing attack. This image manipulation technique creates a melted facial image which is similar to two or more data subjects. If embedded into an ID card, the manipulated reference image can be used by all participating individuals and thus the concept of a unique link is broken. This work elaborates the rather neglected part of selecting morph pairs based on a similarity score instead of a simple random assignment. It discusses the applicability of different possible algorithms. The finally developed approach considers complex real-world constraints while being executable in a reasonable amount of time and producing acceptable large morph sets. It is shown that this algorithm greatly increases the vulnerability of automated face recognition systems. Surprisingly, it also proves that an effective pre-selection of pairs questions the need of in-depth optimized morphing algorithms.},

Thefts of money or sensitive data, harm the reputation of organizations and sabotage of national critical infrastructures are some of the motivations behind these attacks. The sophistication of these attacks is very high, creating major challenges to the detection and mitigation in useful time. In this context the development of systems to provide situational awareness, to detect cyber threats and alert them in real-time are very important to mitigate the impact of the attacks. In this paper we present a cyber threat platform targeted for real-time detection and visualization of cyber threats. The platform is composed by several building blocks and it is able to collect huge amounts of data from multiple sources, prepare and analyze the data and present the findings through a set of insightful dashboards. A version of the platform is already available and used in a real-context. It collects more than 107 million of malware events daily from different data sources and provides visualization and alerts in real-time for more than 2.7 million of infected unique IPs spread around the world.},

abstract={Recent hardware advances have led to the development and consumerization of mobile devices, which mainly include smartphones and various wearable devices. To protect the privacy of users, various user authentication mechanisms have been proposed. In particular, biometrics has been widely used for multi-factor authentication. However, biometrics-based authentication mechanisms usually require costly sensors deployed on devices, and rely on explicit user input and Internet connection for performing user authentication. In this article, we propose a system, called RISKCOG, which can authenticate the ownership of mobile devices unobtrusively and in a real-time manner by adopting a learning-based approach. Unlike previous studies on user authentication, for cross-platform deployment, maximum user privacy protection, and unobtrusive authentication, RISKCOG only relies on those widely available and privacy-insensitive motion sensors to capture the data related to the users' daily device usage. It requires no users' explicit input and has no requirement on the users' motion state or the device placement. RISKCOG is also usable in the environment without Internet access by performing offline user identity verification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on smartphones and smartwatches, which show that RISKCOG can authenticate device users rapidly and with high accuracy.},

From the practicality perspective, it is important to know that “to what degree” the cyber resilience will be improved by adopting a resilience enhancement scheme that requires a certain amount of financial investment. Numerous strategies have been proposed in different sets of literature to make smart grids more resilient against cyber attack. In this paper, the recent proposed techniques published within the past few years are further discussed in terms of three measurable factors including accuracy, computational time, and robustness with an emphasis on false data injection attacks. There is no single solution that would fit all needs in the power industry. Therefore, recently proposed attack detection and recognition schemes are compared and discussed quantitatively.},

abstract={Split manufacturing is a promising technique to defend against fab-based malicious activities such as IP piracy, overbuilding, and insertion of hardware Trojans. However, a network flow-based proximity attack, proposed by Wang et al. (DAC'16) [1], has demonstrated that most prior art on split manufacturing is highly vulnerable. Here in this work, we present two practical layout techniques towards secure split manufacturing: (i) gate-level graph coloring and (ii) clustering of same-type gates. Our approach shows promising results against the advanced proximity attack, lowering its success rate by 5.27x, 3.19x, and 1.73x on average compared to the unprotected layouts when splitting at metal layers M1, M2, and M3, respectively. Also, it largely outperforms previous defense efforts; we observe on average 8x higher resilience when compared to representative prior art. At the same time, extensive simulations on ISCAS'85 and MCNC benchmarks reveal that our techniques incur an acceptable layout overhead. Apart from this empirical study, we provide-for the first time-a theoretical framework for quantifying the layout-level resilience against any proximity-induced information leakage. Towards this end, we leverage the notion of mutual information and provide extensive results to validate our model.},

abstract={Trust management is a promising approach to conduct nodes' transactions and establish management interactions in distributed mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) in which nodes' collaboration is critical to achieve system goals. Lack of centralized management, severe resource constraints (e.g., computing power, energy, and bandwidth), and important network dynamics (e.g., topology changes, node mobility, node failure, and propagation channel conditions) make trust management a challenging task in such a network. Mainly, some trust management basis may be exploited to fulfill new attacks. In this work, we present a holistic view on various trust management frameworks geared for MANETs, capable to handle main existing attacks deceiving trustworthiness computation to mislead trust-based network operations, referred to as trust-distortion attacks. Besides, we propose a taxonomy of main identified trust-distortion attacks based on how the trustworthiness estimation of a node about another node is distorted. Moreover, we provide a holistic classification of main evaluation metrics, which can be used to evaluate and compare such frameworks. For each framework, a unified approach is used to describe the trust model, taking each component required for trust management as a guideline. Moreover, each framework is analyzed regarding its resistance against different trust-distortion attacks, the framework unique features, merits, demerits, and findings. Finally, we compare different trust-distortion resistant frameworks and outline the open issues and future research directions.},

abstract={Botnets are collections of infected computers that are controlled centrally by a botmaster, often for sending spam or launching denial of service attacks. The task to take down these botnets is often a cat and mouse game with operators frequently changing domains for their control infrastructure. More recently, operators have moved to using Tor, a pseudo-anonymous network for hosting services whereby identification is difficult. Additionally, because connections to the Tor network are encrypted, we cannot use traditional methods like Domain Name System (DNS) and traffic signatures to detect infected hosts. In this paper, we introduce TorBot Stalker: the first mechanism for detecting, de-anonymizing, and destroying Tor botnets. We use machine learning to analyse and fingerprint the timings and frequency of Tor network circuit data when routing botnet traffic, and build a detection mechanism that is able to identify infected hosts at the Tor network border, in real-time, while preserving the privacy of legitimate users. TorBot Stalker can be implemented at any node in the Tor network and can differentiate between botnets and legitimate applications like Internet Relay Chat (IRC) coming from the same host. Experimental data demonstrates an accuracy of 99% with few false positives. We then apply the technique at the entry to the Tor network to measure the fraction of traffic which is for botnet. We observed that Torbot Stalker is able to de-anonymize real botnets in the Tor network and further identify infected hosts and control servers.},

abstract={Images are becoming one of the key enablers of user connectivity in social media applications. Many of them are directly exploring image content to suggest new friends with similar interests. To handle the explosive volumes of images, one common trend is to leverage the public cloud as their robust service backend. Despite the convenience, exposing content-rich images to the cloud inevitably raises acute privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving architecture for image-centric social discovery services, designed to function over encrypted images. We first adopt the effective Bag-of-Words model to extract the “visual content” of users' images into respective image profile vectors. We then model the core problem as similarity retrieval of encrypted high-dimensional vectors. To achieve scalable services over millions of encrypted images, we design a secure and efficient index structure, which enables practical and accurate social discovery from the cloud, without revealing any image profile or image content. For completeness, we further enrich our service with secure updates, facilitating user's image update. Our implementation is deployed at an Android phone and Amazon Cloud, and extensive experiments are conducted on a large Flickr image dataset which demonstrates the desired quality of services.},

abstract={The problem of malicious activities in online social networks, such as Sybil attacks and malevolent use of fake identities, can severely affect the social activities in which users engage while online. For example, this problem can affect content publishing, creation of friendships, messaging, profile browsing, and commenting. Moreover, fake identities are often created to disseminate spam, use the private information of other users, commit fraud, and so on. A malicious person can generate numerous fake accounts for these purposes to reach a large number of trustworthy users. Thus, these types of malicious accounts must be detected and deactivated as quickly as possible. However, this objective is challenging, because a fake account can exhibit trustworthy behaviors and have a type of name that will prevent it from being detected by the security system. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of literature from 2006 to 2016 on Sybil attacks in online social networks and use of social networks as a tool to analyze and prevent these attack types. We first review existing Sybil attack definitions, including those in the context of online social networks. We then discuss a new taxonomy of Sybil attack defense schemes and methodologies. Finally, we compare the literature and identify areas for further research in Sybil attacks in online social networks.},

abstract={In smart cities, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) act as a type of core infrastructure that collects data from the city to implement smart services. The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.},

abstract={Social network contains more and more sensitive information, which makes the analysis of it more valuable. Network reconstruction is an important method for network analysis which is worthy to further study. In order to have a deep comprehension of the methods and the classification of network reconstruction, we need to do a classification and analysis for it. In this paper, network reconstruction on social network is the main research direction. Firstly, we introduce some concepts of privacy, protection methods and attack methods for social networks. After that we lead to the concept and usage of network reconstruction. Secondly, the existing methods of network reconstruction are introduced and classified based on the sources of observation data: information from node and information from network structure. And then we classify its application. Finally, we analyze the problem and challenge of existing methods. Meanwhile, some research points are also summarized to indicate the direction for other researchers and future work.},

abstract={The early detection of cybersecurity events such as attacks is challenging given the constantly evolving threat landscape. Even with advanced monitoring, sophisticated attackers can spend more than 100 days in a system before being detected. This paper describes a novel, collaborative framework that assists a security analyst by exploiting the power of semantically rich knowledge representation and reasoning integrated with different machine learning techniques. Our Cognitive Cybersecurity System ingests information from various textual sources and stores them in a common knowledge graph using terms from an extended version of the Unified Cybersecurity Ontology. The system then reasons over the knowledge graph that combines a variety of collaborative agents representing host and network-based sensors to derive improved actionable intelligence for security administrators, decreasing their cognitive load and increasing their confidence in the result. We describe a proof of concept framework for our approach and demonstrate its capabilities by testing it against a custom-built ransomware similar to WannaCry.},

abstract={Adaptive capacity with cost-efficient resource provisioning is a crucial capability for future 6G networks. In this work, we conceptualize "expansive networks" which refers to a networking paradigm where networks should be able to extend their resource base by opportunistic but self-controlled expansive actions. To this end, we elaborate on a key aspect of an expansive network as a concrete example: Spectrum resource at the PHY layer. Evidently, future wireless networks need to provide efficient mechanisms to coexist in the licensed and unlicensed bands and operate in expansive mode. In this work, we first describe spectrum sharing issues and possibilities in 6G networks for expansive networks. We then present security implications of expansive networks, an important concern due to more open and coupled systems in expansive networks. We also discuss two key enablers, namely distributed ledger technology (DLT) and network intelligence via machine learning, which are promising to realize expansive networks for the spectrum sharing aspect.},

volume={16},
number={3},
pages={1602-1616},
abstract={In this article, with the rapid development of industrial Internet of Things, a large number of embedded devices, such as sensors and tag readers, have been widely deployed for gathering and sending data. These devices are commonly unreliable and vulnerable to many threats, because they are located in unattended areas which are vulnerable to device capture attacks. Such environments can be regarded as white-box attack contexts, in which the adversary has total visibility and full control of the implementations. White-box cryptography (WBC) aims to protect implementations of symmetric encryption algorithms in white-box attack contexts. Unfortunately, existing WBC schemes are vulnerable to various attacks, and most of them are insufficiently secure in strict white-box attack contexts. Based on the investigation of existing designs and the corresponding cryptanalysis, we propose a novel design approach for securing WBC schemes, which is named state-dependent selectable random substitutions (SDSRS). It uses SDSRSs to defeat various related white-box cryptanalytic approaches. With special considerations for IIoT systems, such as high performance for supporting real-time applications and small block size for fitting industrial protocols, a concrete WBC scheme designed with the proposed approach has been provided. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure. Additionally, experimental results indicate that the scheme performs well in practice, and it is significantly efficient in time and energy consumptions compared with existing secure white-box cryptographic schemes.},

abstract={RaptorQ is the most advanced fountain code proposed so far. Its properties make it attractive for forward error correction (FEC), offering high reliability at low overheads (i.e., for a small amount of repair information) and efficient encoding and decoding operations. Since RaptorQ's emergence, it has already been standardized by the IETF, and there is the expectation that it will be adopted by several other standardization bodies, in areas related to digital media broadcast, cellular networks, and satellite communications. The paper describes a new attack on RaptorQ that breaks the near ideal FEC performance, by carefully choosing which packets are allowed to reach the receiver. Furthermore, the attack was extended to be performed over secure channels with IPsec/ESP. The paper also proposes a few solutions to protect the code from the attack, which could be easily integrated into the implementations.},

abstract={Deep neural networks have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks: subtle perturbation can completely change prediction result. The vulnerability has led to a surge of research in this direction, including adversarial attacks on object detection networks. However, previous studies are dedicated to attacking anchor-based object detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack on anchor-free object detectors. It conducts category-wise, instead of previously instance-wise, attacks on object detectors, and leverages high-level semantic information to efficiently generate transferable adversarial examples, which can also be transferred to attack other object detectors, even anchor-based detectors such as Faster R-CNN. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and transferability.},

abstract={In emerging information networks, it is crucially important to provide efficient search on distributed documents while preserving their owners' privacy, for which privacy preserving indexes or PPI presents a possible solution. An understudied problem for the PPI techniques is how to provide differentiated privacy preservation in the presence of multi-keyword document search. The differentiation is necessary as terms and phrases bear innate differences in their semantic meanings. In this paper, we present ϵ-MPPI, the first work to provide the distributed document search with quantitatively differentiated privacy preservation. In the design of ϵ-MPPI, we identified a suite of challenging problems and proposed novel solutions. For one, we formulated the quantitative privacy computation as an optimization problem that strikes a balance between privacy preservation and search efficiency. We also addressed the challenging problem of secure ϵ-MPPI construction in the multi-domain information network which lacks mutual trusts between domains. Towards a secure ϵ-MPPIconstruction with practically acceptable performance, we proposed to optimize the performance of secure multi-party computations by making a novel use of secret sharing. We implemented the ϵ-MPPI construction protocol with a functioning prototype. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the prototype's effectiveness and efficiency based on a real-world dataset.},

abstract={This work describes the task of inventorying Baltic mixed forests at an individual tree level. The development of a practicable methodology for semi-automated identification of tree species was targeted. Data acquisition equipment and preprocessing software, explored forest area, processing approaches, obtained classification results as well as newly developed software are described. To resolve the core problem - tree species identification - a classification approach is proposed for processing multi-spectral imagery data from the vicinity of tree tops. A multi-class classifier is designed from multi-spectral data of interactively selected trees included in initial design (training) sets for two conifer and three deciduous species of interest. An approach for the stabilization of the classification results is proposed, based on improving the representativeness of the design sets by selection of trees from different locations, dismissing trees with overlapping crowns and anomalies, followed by the calculation of a spectral dissimilarity parameter of the design sets and dismissing the sets of trees of any species which are too similar. The best classification results were obtained using a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, species clusters were created by adding randomly selected trees from the whole analyzed forest area. Final classification of all trees was done by using a Bayes classifier designed on the basis of cluster properties. A procedure for increasing robustness of the clustering stage is proposed, based on performing multiple clustering attempts, each using a randomly sampled subset of a chosen design set for the classifier design, and making a decision about the class of each tree by the majority vote from the results of these attempts. This classification algorithm was tested against the set of trees, for which information was available from field work. It is shown that a mean classification error below 3% can be achieved and the maximum error rate was decreased substantially by applying the proposed approach for selection of representative design sets.},

abstract={Distributed link-flooding attacks constitute a new class of attacks with the potential to segment large areas of the Internet. Their distributed nature makes detection and mitigation very hard. This work proposes a novel framework for the analytical modeling and optimal mitigation of such attacks. The detection is modeled as a problem of relational algebra, representing the association of potential attackers (bots) to potential targets. The analysis seeks to optimally dissolve all but the malevolent associations. The framework is implemented at the level of online Traffic Engineering (TE), which is naturally triggered on link-flooding events. The key idea is to continuously re-route traffic in a manner that makes persistent participation to link-flooding events highly improbable for any benign source. Thus, bots are forced to adopt a suspicious behavior to remain effective, revealing their presence. The load-balancing objective of TE is not affected at all. Extensive simulations on various topologies validate our analytical findings.},

Developing countermeasures against such security threats is highly crucial. Accordingly, this paper first develops a learning-based trust verification framework to detect hardware Trojans. To tackle Trojan insertion, IP piracy and overproduction, logic locking schemes and in particular stripped functionality logic locking is discussed and its resiliency against the state-of-the-art attacks is investigated.},

abstract={The importance of the Internet for society is increasing. To ensure a functional Internet, its routers need to operate correctly. However, the need for router flexibility has led to the use of software-programmable network processors in routers, which exposes these systems to data plane attacks. Recently, hardware monitors have been introduced into network processors to verify the expected behavior of processor cores at run time. If instruction-level execution deviates from the expected sequence, an attack is identified, triggering processor core recovery efforts. In this manuscript, we describe a scalable network processor monitoring system that supports the reallocation of hardware monitors to processor cores in response to workload changes. The scalability of our monitoring architecture is demonstrated using theoretical models, simulation, and router system-level experiments implemented on an FPGAbased hardware platform. For a system with four processor cores and six monitors, the monitors result in a 6 percent logic and 38 percent memory bit overhead versus the processor's core logic and instruction storage. No slowdown of system throughput due to monitoring is reported.},

abstract={Despite continuous defense efforts, DDoS attacks are still very prevalent on the Internet. In such arms races, attackers are becoming more agile and their strategies are more sophisticated to escape from detection. Effective defenses demand in-depth understanding of such strategies. In this paper, we set to investigate the DDoS landscape from the perspective of the attackers. We focus on the dynamics of the attacking force, aiming to explore the strategies behind the scenes, if any. Our study is based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks across the globe in a seven-month period. Our results indicate that attackers deliberately schedule their controlled bots in a dynamic fashion, and such dynamics can be well captured by statistical distributions. Furthermore, different botnet families exhibit similar scheduling patterns, strongly suggesting their close relationship and potential collaborations. Such collaborations are further confirmed by bots rotating in multiple families, and such rotation patterns are examined and confirmed at various levels. These findings lay a promising foundation for predicting DDoS attacks in the future and aid mitigation efforts.},

volume={9},

pages={23876-23893},
abstract={Currently, increasingly ubiquitous location-based services are facilitating the activities of people in daily life. However, releasing real locations could lead to serious concerns about privacy. To remedy these issues, a number of location privacy protection mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed, e.g., spatial cloaking, dummy location generation, query caching, and perturbation. However, these LPPMs are vulnerable to inference attacks because of the incompleteness of the captured privacy risks caused by heterogeneous correlations in location data, e.g., semantical, temporal, and social correlations. Consequently, they cannot provide sufficient privacy guarantees due to the absence of embedded heterogeneous correlations in the design process of LPPM. To address these issues, we present QUAD, a framework for quantifying location privacy risks under heterogeneous correlations. QUAD has three features: 1) it enables the modeling and seamless fusion of multiple kinds of correlations that are available to adversaries; 2) it provides a probabilistic representation of the privacy risks faced under heterogeneous correlations; and 3) it achieves the quantification of privacy risks for multiple kinds of LPPMs that are widely used in the literature. To mitigate privacy threats, we propose a defense mechanism embedded with the quantified privacy risks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm that QUAD can capture more privacy risks than competitors, and the risks can be dramatically reduced by our defense mechanism.},

abstract={Privacy-preserving protocols and tools are increasingly adopted by Internet users nowadays. These mechanisms are challenged by the process of traffic classification (TC) which, other than being an important workhorse for several network management tasks, becomes a key factor in the assessment of their privacy level, both from offensive (malign) and defensive (benign) standpoints. In this paper, we propose TC of anonymity tools (and deeper, of their running services and applications) via a truly hierarchical approach. Capitalizing a public dataset released in 2017 containing anonymity traffic, we provide an in-depth analysis of TC and we compare the proposed hierarchical approach with a flat counterpart. The proposed framework is investigated in both the usual TC setup and its “early” variant (i.e., only the first segments of traffic aggregate are used to take a decision). Results highlight a general improvement over the flat approach in terms of all the classification metrics. Further performance gains are also accomplished by tuning the thresholds ensuring progressive censoring. Finally, fine-grain performance investigation allows us to demonstrate lower severity of errors incurred by the hierarchical approach (as opposed to the flat case) and highlight poorly classifiable services/applications of each anonymity tool, gathering useful feedback on their privacy level.},

abstract={Low Power Wireless (LPW) networks have recently been emerging as key candidates to offer affordable connectivity for the constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, they also raise major security concerns due to the inherent security vulnerabilities of built-in communication protocols. By exploiting these flaws, an adversary can attack sensors or actuators in an LPW network and force them to execute energy-hungry tasks such as verifying unauthenticated garbage messages repeatedly. This attack, namely energy depletion attack (EDA), can drain the batteries of the devices rapidly and lead to soaring network-wide energy expenditure. Consequently, the offense can leave the victims disabled, and even shut down the whole network due to the battery exhaustion of all the devices. In this paper, we investigate existing studies and provide a systematic review of EDAs and defenses in LPW networks. Through this work, we conclude that most existing LPW technologies are vulnerable to EDAs. This paper also indicates the security challenges in LPW networks related to EDAs along with the potential research directions. While LPW technologies have already hit the market with the promising deployment schedules, our attempt can inspire the research community to enhance the security of underlying protocols that will shape the connectivity of billions of devices in the future IoT ecosystem.},

abstract={Hadoop framework has been evolved to manage big data in cloud. Hadoop distributed file system and MapReduce, the vital components of this framework, provide scalable and fault-tolerant big data storage and processing services at a lower cost. However, Hadoop does not provide any robust authentication mechanism for principals’ authentication. In fact, the existing state-of-the-art authentication protocols are vulnerable to various security threats, such as man-in-the-middle, replay, password guessing, stolen-verifier, privileged-insider, identity compromization, impersonation, denial-of-service, online/off-line dictionary, chosen plaintext, workstation compromization, and server-side compromisation attacks. Beside these threats, the state-of-the-art mechanisms lack to address the server-side data integrity and confidentiality issues. In addition to this, most of the existing authentication protocols follow a single-server-based user authentication strategy, which, in fact, originates single point of failure and single point of vulnerability issues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant authentication protocol suitable for the Hadoop framework, which is called the efficient authentication protocol for Hadoop (HEAP). HEAP alleviates the major issues of the existing state-of-the-art authentication mechanisms, namely operating-system-based authentication, password-based approach, and delegated token-based schemes, respectively, which are presently deployed in Hadoop. HEAP follows two-server-based authentication mechanism. HEAP authenticates the principal based on digital signature generation and verification strategy utilizing both advanced encryption standard and elliptic curve cryptography. The security analysis using both the formal security using the broadly accepted real-or-random (ROR) model and the informal (non-mathematical) security shows that HEAP protects several well-known attacks. In addition, the formal security verification using the widely used automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications ensures that HEAP is resilient against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, the performance study contemplates that the overheads incurred in HEAP is reasonable and is also comparable to that of other existing state-of-the-art authentication protocols. High security along with comparable overheads makes HEAP to be robust and practical for a secure access to the big data storage and processing services.},

abstract={Security assurance is a rapidly evolving but well understood discipline in the software industry. Many firms have adopted the Security Development Lifecycle as a process to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their products before they are released. To do this, they rely on sound software security practices, tools and precise technical information available through a vast collection of publicly known vulnerabilities and exploits. Historically, secure development practices for hardware products have not developed as fast. Only a limited number of methodologies, standards, exploits, and testing tools exist to assist vendors with their security assurance goals. This paper presents a Hardware Security Development Lifecycle at the hardware technology level that has been used on commercial CPUs, chipsets, and SoCs. It describes how a structured flow of analysis and testing activities organized in five phases can accelerate the discovery of security issues in computer hardware products that could be exploited through software or physical attacks. We summarize lessons learned over several years of security evaluation experience that have resulted in a systematic method that can be adapted to make security assurance an integral part of hardware development cycles.},

abstract={Contact tracing has become a vital tool for public health officials to effectively combat the spread of new diseases, such as the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. Contact tracing is not new to epidemiologist rather, it used manual or semi-manual approaches that are incredibly time-consuming, costly and inefficient. It mostly relies on human memory while scalability is a significant challenge in tackling pandemics. The unprecedented health and socio-economic impacts led researchers and practitioners around the world to search for technology-based approaches for providing scalable and timely answers. Smartphones and associated digital technologies have the potential to provide a better approach due to their high level of penetration, coupled with mobility. While data-driven solutions are extremely powerful, the fear among citizens is that information like location or proximity associated with other personal data can be weaponised by the states to enforce surveillance. Low adoption rate of such apps due to the lack of trust questioned the efficacy and demanded researchers to find innovative solution for building digital-trust, and appropriately balancing privacy and accuracy of data. In this paper, we have critically reviewed such protocols and apps to identify the strength and weakness of each approach. Finally, we have penned down our recommendations to make the future contact tracing mechanisms more universally inter-operable and privacy-preserving.},

abstract={The wireless boundaries of networks are becoming increasingly important from a security standpoint as the proliferation of 802.11 WiFi technology increases. Concurrently, the complexity of 802.11 access point implementation is rapidly outpacing the standardization process. The result is that nascent wireless functionality management is left up to the individual provider's implementation, which creates new vulnerabilities in wireless networks. One such functional improvement to 802.11 is the virtual access point (VAP), a method of broadcasting logically separate networks from the same physical equipment. Network reconnaissance benefits from VAP identification, not only because network topology is a primary aim of such reconnaissance, but because the knowledge that a secure network and an insecure network are both being broadcast from the same physical equipment is tactically relevant information. In this work, we present a novel graph-theoretic approach to VAP identification which leverages a body of research concerned with establishing community structure. We apply our approach to both synthetic data and a large corpus of real-world data to demonstrate its efficacy. In most real-world cases, near-perfect blind identification is possible highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed VAP identification algorithm.},

abstract={With the rapid proliferation of new technologies and services in the wireless domain, spectrum scarcity has become a major concern. The allocation of the Industrial, Medical and Scientific (ISM) band has enabled the explosion of new technologies (e.g. Wi-Fi) due to its licence-exempt characteristic. The widespread adoption of Wi-Fi technology, combined with the rapid penetration of smart phones running popular user services (e.g. social online networks) has overcrowded substantially the ISM band. On the other hand, according to a number of recent reports, several parts of the static allocated licensed bands are under-utilized. This has brought up the idea of the opportunistic use of these bands through the, so-called, cognitive radios and cognitive radio networks. Cognitive radios have enabled the opportunity to transmit in several licensed bands without causing harmful interference to licensed users. Along with the realization of cognitive radios, new security threats have been raised. Adversaries can exploit several vulnerabilities of this new technology and cause severe performance degradation. Security threats are mainly related to two fundamental characteristics of cognitive radios: cognitive capability, and reconfigurability. Threats related to the cognitive capability include attacks launched by adversaries that mimic primary transmitters, and transmission of false observations related to spectrum sensing. Reconfiguration can be exploited by attackers through the use of malicious code installed in cognitive radios. Furthermore, as cognitive radio networks are wireless in nature, they face all classic threats present in the conventional wireless networks. The scope of this work is to give an overview of the security threats and challenges that cognitive radios and cognitive radio networks face, along with the current state-of-the-art to detect the corresponding attacks. In addition, future challenges are addressed.},

abstract={Data security, which is concerned with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, is still challenging the application of wireless mesh networks (WMNs). In this paper, we focus on a special type of denial-of-service attack, called selective forwarding or grey hole attack. When this attack is launched at the gateways of a WMN where data tend to aggregate, it could lead to severe damages due to loss of sensitive data. Most existing proposals that focus on detecting stand-alone attackers via channel overhearing are ineffective against collusive attackers. In this paper, we propose a forwarding assessment based detection (FADE) scheme to mitigate collaborative grey hole attacks. Specifically, FADE detects sophisticated attacks by means of forwarding assessments aided by two-hop acknowledgement monitoring. Moreover, FADE can coexist with contemporary link security techniques. We analyze the optimal detection threshold that minimizes the sum of false positive rate and false negative rate of FADE, considering the network dynamics due to degraded channel quality or medium access collisions. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the adaptability of FADE to network dynamics and its effectiveness in detecting collaborative grey hole attacks.},

abstract={The Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is an emerging paradigm at the cross-roads of Internet of Things (IoT), E-healthcare and synthetic biology. IoB Nt relies on innovating molecular communication between biologically synthesized nanodevices to facilitate in vivo drug delivery, remote monitoring and healthcare management via. the Internet. IoBNT therefore, requires robust security primitives to adequately address patient privacy concerns, increase physician confidence as well as limit (any) malicious operation resulting in bio-terrorism. The present work focused on securing the bio-cyber interfacing of IoB Nt technologies and considered three prevalent bio-electrical transduction techniques including bio-luminescence, redox modality and biological field effect transistors (BioFETs). Using the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms, the proposed security framework employed parameter profiling the distinct operating features of bio-cyber interfaces and aimed to identify anomalous operation. During validation, an optimal profiling accuracy ranging between 88-91 % was recorded. The corresponding time complexity, scalability and qualitative analysis of the proposed parameter profiling-based framework leads to us to recommend it for further adoption in improving IoBNT security.},

abstract={The Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) is used in GSM/UMTS telecommunication technologies for signalling and management of communication. It was designed on the concept of private boundary walled technology having mutual trust between few national/multinational operators with no inherent security controls in 1970s. Deregulation, expansion, and merger of telecommunication technology with data networks have vanquished the concept of boundary walls hence increasing the number of service providers, entry points, and interfaces to the SS7 network, which made it vulnerable to serious attacks. The SS7 exploits can be used by attackers to intercept messages, track a subscriber's location, tape/redirect calls, adversely affect disaster relief operations, drain funds of individuals from banks in combination with other methods and send billions of spam messages. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the SS7 attacks with detailed methods to execute attacks, methods to enter the SS7 core network, and recommends safeguards against the SS7 attacks. It also provides a machine learning based framework to detect anomalies in the SS7 network which is compared with rule based filtering. It further presents a conceptual model for the defense of network.},

abstract={DDoS attack is one of the major concerns for network and cloud service providers, due to its substantial impact on revenue/cost and especially on their reputation. Also, network administrators are looking for solutions to manage voluminous data traffic. SDN is an emerging networking paradigm that provides a flexible network management. Hence, SDN is being widely adopted for wired, wireless, and mobile networks. Apart from a single point of failure (the controller), an attacker can target SDN at various levels by DDoS attacks. Existing solutions either focus on a particular attack type or require cumbersome alterations in SDN infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive, yet effective and lightweight approach to detect various fundamentally different DDoS attacks in SDN. Our approach relies on sequential analysis. We employ a non-parametric change point detection technique called Cumulative Sum (CuSum). Our framework also includes an adaptive threshold scheme that adapts with the changing traffic pattern. Additionally, our framework can be tuned to suffice critical security requirements such as high detection rate and low false alarm rate. We evaluated the effectiveness of our solution using CAIDA Internet traces as well as DARPA intrusion detection evaluation dataset. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our mechanism. In particular, average false alarm rate in our experiments was under 11.64%. On average, our method is able to detect DDoS attacks within 4.15 seconds.},

abstract={Malicious actors are increasingly using TLS to evade deep packet inspection (DPI). In response, vendors and enterprises have turned to man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxies to enable security monitoring of encrypted traffic. This approach not only breaks the end-to-end authentication component of TLS but requires clients to trust a root certificate that allows the proxy to masquerade as any domain. This paper presents Locally Operated Cooperative Key Sharing (LOCKS), a novel system that enables local clients to share their TLS session keys with the enterprise security monitoring system, facilitating DPI without subverting authentication. We tested the performance and impact of our new approach to enterprise communications security. Specifically, we conducted tests on browser latency, user experience, and packet loss at the network security monitors. Latency change was statistically indistinguishable from normal network variation. While the workload of decrypting TLS added overhead to our security monitors, the impact was within manageable limits. Additionally, we deployed LOCKS in a real-world environment and performed initial alpha testing. A user study demonstrated no negative impact on usability.},

abstract={Traditional centralized data storage and processing solutions manifest limitations with regards to overall operational cost and the security and auditability of data. One of the biggest issues with existing solutions is the difficulty of keeping track of who has had access to the data and how the data may have changed over its lifetime; while providing a secure and easy-to-use mechanism to share the data between different users. The ability to electronically regulate data sharing within and across different organizational entities in the supply chain (SC) is an open issue that is only addressed partially by existing legal and regulatory compliance frameworks. In this article, we present Cydon, a decentralized data management platform that executes bespoke distributed applications utilizing a novel search and retrieve algorithm leveraging metadata attributes. Cydon utilizes a smart distributed ledger to offer an immutable audit trail and transaction history for all different levels of data access and modification within a SC and for all data flows within the environment. Results suggest that Cydon provides authorized and fast access to secure distributed data, avoids single points of failure by securely distributing encrypted data across different nodes while maintains an “always-on” chain of custody.},

abstract={We introduce a Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) storage system providing strong assurances of data retention and compliant migration, by leveraging trusted secure hardware in close data proximity. This is important because existing compliance storage products and research prototypes are fundamentally vulnerable to faulty or malicious behavior, as they rely on simple enforcement primitives that are ill-suited for their threat model. This is hard because tamper-proof processing elements are significantly constrained in both computation ability and memory capacity-as heat dissipation concerns under tamper-resistant requirements limit their maximum allowable spatial gate-density. We achieve efficiency by 1) ensuring the secure hardware is accessed sparsely, minimizing the associated overhead for expected transaction loads, and 2) using adaptive overhead-amortized constructs to enforce WORM semantics at the throughput rate of the storage server's ordinary processors during burst periods. With a single secure coprocessor, on commodity x86 hardware, the architecture can support unlimited read throughputs and over 2500 write transactions per second.},

abstract={Physical layer security offers an efficient means to decrease the risk of confidential information leakage through wiretap links. In this paper, we address the physical-layer security in a cooperative wireless subnetwork that includes a source-destination pair and multiple relays, exchanging information in the presence of a malevolent eavesdropper. Specifically, the eavesdropper is active in the network and transmits artificial noise (AN) with a multiple-antenna transmitter to confound both the relays and the destination. We first analyse the secrecy capacity of the direct source-to-destination transmission in terms of intercept probability (IP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP). A decode-and-forward incremental relaying (IR) protocol is then introduced to improve security of communications in the presence of the active eavesdropper. Within this context, and depending on the availability of channel state information, three different schemes (one optimal and two sub-optimal) are proposed to select a trusted relay and improve the achievable secrecy rate. For each one of these schemes, and for both selection and maximum ratio combining at the destination and eavesdropper, we derive new and exact closed-form expressions for the IP and SOP. Our analysis and simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed IR-based selection schemes for secure communication. They also confirm the existence of a floor phenomenon for the SOP in the absence of AN.},

The impact of the number of selected bands on classification accuracy was obtained thanks to SFFS, while a band importance measure was derived from intermediate sets of bands tested by GA.

abstract={Amplified and disrupting cyber-attacks might lead to severe security incidents with drastic consequences such as large property damage, sensitive information breach, or even disruption of the national economy. While traditional intrusion detection and prevention system might successfully detect low or moderate levels of attack, the cooperation among different organizations is necessary to defend against multi-stage and large-scale cyber-attacks. Correlating intrusion alerts from a shared database of multiple sources provides security analysts with succinct and high-level patterns of cyber-attacks - a powerful tool to combat with sophisticate attacks. However, sharing intrusion alert data raises a significant privacy concern among data holders, since publishing this information means a risk of exposing other sensitive information such as intranet topology, network services, and the security infrastructure. This paper discusses possible cryptographic approaches to tackle this issue. Organizers can encrypt their intrusion alert data to protect data confidentiality and outsource them to a shared server to reduce the cost of storage and maintenance, while, at the same time, benefit from a larger source of information for alert correlation process. Two privacy preserving alert correlation techniques are proposed under semi-honest model. These methods are based on attribute similarity and prerequisite/consequence conditions of cyber-attacks.},

abstract={In recent years, applications of machine learning have grown rapidly in various areas. With the accelerating rate of data generation, and recent developments in big data analytics, machine learning has become a de facto standard in many applications that benefited the society in many areas. However, with the increasing number and types of machine learning applications, it has become a target for an increasing number of malicious actors. Security challenges became more complex and diverse in machine-learning-based systems.In this paper, we present a concise survey and discussion of the mechanisms employed by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in machine learning algorithms or injecting malicious data. The paper focuses on most recent attacks reported in literature and discusses the methods proposed to counter these attacks and reduce their impact.},

abstract={The rapid developments of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart mobile devices in recent years have been dramatically incentivizing the advancement of edge computing. On the one hand, edge computing has provided a great assistance for lightweight devices to accomplish complicated tasks in an efficient way; on the other hand, its hasty development leads to the neglection of security threats to a large extent in edge computing platforms and their enabled applications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the most influential and basic attacks as well as the corresponding defense mechanisms that have edge computing specific characteristics and can be practically applied to real-world edge computing systems. More specifically, we focus on the following four types of attacks that account for 82% of the edge computing attacks recently reported by Statista: distributed denial of service attacks, side-channel attacks, malware injection attacks, and authentication and authorization attacks. We also analyze the root causes of these attacks, present the status quo and grand challenges in edge computing security, and propose future research directions.},

abstract={Machine learning algorithms are effective in several applications, but they are not as much successful when applied to intrusion detection in cyber security. Due to the high sensitivity to their training data, cyber detectors based on machine learning are vulnerable to targeted adversarial attacks that involve the perturbation of initial samples. Existing defenses assume unrealistic scenarios; their results are underwhelming in non-adversarial settings; or they can be applied only to machine learning algorithms that perform poorly for cyber security. We present an original methodology for countering adversarial perturbations targeting intrusion detection systems based on random forests. As a practical application, we integrate the proposed defense method in a cyber detector analyzing network traffic. The experimental results on millions of labelled network flows show that the new detector has a twofold value: it outperforms state-of-the-art detectors that are subject to adversarial attacks; it exhibits robust results both in adversarial and non-adversarial scenarios.},

abstract={In industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, where a plethora of IoT technologies coexist with consolidated industrial infrastructures, the integration of security mechanisms that provide protection against cyber-security attacks becomes a critical challenge. Due to the stealthy and persistent nature of some of these attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats, it is crucial to go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for the traceability of these attacks. In this sense, opinion dynamics poses a novel approach for the correlation of anomalies, which has been successfully applied to other network security domains. In this article, we aim to analyze its applicability in the IIoT from a technical point of view, by studying its deployment over different IIoT architectures and defining a common framework for the acquisition of data considering the computational constraints involved. The result is a beneficial insight that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach when applied to upcoming IIoT infrastructures.},

abstract={Security vulnerabilities have become significant concerns due to growing demand of Internet of Things (IoT) not only for home automation systems, but also for various industrial applications. Central security technologies are vulnerable to single-point failure that could reduce attack handling technology efficiency. Distributed security frameworks are used in resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT networks. Conventional security strategies are insufficient to protect the distributed and dynamic existence of IoT networks. Conversely, Software Define Network (SDN) and Blockchain are two emerging techniques expected to solve heterogeneous IoT network security. This analysis work therefore mainly seeks to examine IoT network features, security specifications, and challenges. Thereafter, well-known threats or attacks are analyzed in IoT. SDN and blockchain-based countermeasures are addressed for IoT network security with a case study. Finally, to enhance security and privacy , numerous open issues are discussed.},

abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) gave us the capability to connect real-world objects to the Internet, making our lives more convenient. However, hackers have been known to crack into these real-world systems causing more inconvenience to the people than making their lives easier. Smart cars are one of the technologies which make our lives easier, but if an attacker exploits its vulnerabilities, they can cause severe discomfort to the passengers and the people around. In recent years, there have been instances where Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) were attacked by hackers, which granted complete and total control of the car to the attacker, or where the network was jammed, which led to the loss of information. In this paper, we present the simulation of a DDoS attack in a virtual environment of OMNET++ on a network of connected autonomous/smart cars. We also discuss and show how this attack can affect the communication between the cars which are interacting with each other using the well-known IEEE 802.11p DSRC protocol. Related simulation results are presented and discussed.},

We set up a medium interaction honeypot offering telnet and SSH services. With this honeypot we captured data from attack sessions. This data was used for statistical and behavioural analysis, such as distributions of attacks and different attacker IPs, originating countries, employed anonymisation services, skill level of an adversary and commonly targeted embedded devices. Furthermore, machine learning techniques that are capable of identifying unique types of sessions based on issued commands and provided credentials are presented in this work.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT)-Cloud combines the IoT and cloud computing, which not only enhances the IoT's capability but also expands the scope of its applications. However, it exhibits significant security and efficiency problems that must be solved. Internal attacks account for a large fraction of the associated security problems, however, traditional security strategies are not capable of addressing these attacks effectively. Moreover, as repeated/similar service requirements become greater in number, the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services is seriously affected. In this paper, a novel architecture that integrates a trust evaluation mechanism and service template with a balance dynamics based on cloud and edge computing is proposed to overcome these problems. In this architecture, the edge network and the edge platform are designed in such a way as to reduce resource consumption and ensure the extensibility of trust evaluation mechanism, respectively. To improve the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services, the service parameter template is established in the cloud and the service parsing template is established in the edge platform. Moreover, the edge network can assist the edge platform in establishing service parsing templates based on the trust evaluation mechanism and meet special service requirements. The experimental results illustrate that this edge-based architecture can improve both the security and efficiency of IoT-Cloud systems.},

abstract={The potential to extract actionable insights from Big Data has gained increased attention of researchers in academia as well as several industrial sectors. The field has become interesting and problems look even more exciting to solve ever since organizations have been trying to tame large volumes of complex and fast arriving Big Data streams through newer computing paradigms. However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists. Deriving information from Big Data is also subject to challenges associated with data security and privacy. These and other challenges are discussed in context of the selected problems to illustrate the potential of Big Data analytics.},

IIoT links all types of industrial equipment through the network; establishes data acquisition, exchange, and analysis systems; and optimizes processes and services, so as to reduce cost and enhance productivity. The introduction of edge computing in IIoT can significantly reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and to some extent, protect privacy. This paper outlines the research progress concerning edge computing in IIoT. First, the concepts of IIoT and edge computing are discussed, and subsequently, the research progress of edge computing is discussed and summarized in detail. Next, the future architecture from the perspective of edge computing in IIoT is proposed, and its technical progress in routing, task scheduling, data storage and analytics, security, and standardization is analyzed. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of edge computing in IIoT in terms of 5G-based edge communication, load balancing and data offloading, edge intelligence, as well as data sharing security.

abstract={With the speedy growth of distributed networks such as Internet of Things (IoT), there is an increasing need to protect network security against various attacks by deploying collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs), which allow different detector nodes to exchange required information and data with each other. While due to the distributed architecture, insider attacks are a big threat for CIDSs, in which an attacker can reside inside the network. To address this issue, designing an appropriate trust management scheme is considered as an effective solution. In this work, we first analyze the development of CIDSs in the past decades and identify the major challenges on building an effective trust management scheme. Then we introduce a generic framework aiming to enhance the security of CIDSs against advanced insider threats by deriving multilevel trust. In the study, our results demonstrate the viability and the effectiveness of our framework.},

abstract={Multi-hop networks are expected to be an important part of 5G mobile systems. In a multi-hop cellular network (MCN), the nodes assist each other in relaying packets towards their destinations. The structures and operations of multi-hop networks make them particularly vulnerable to certain types of attack. Hence, security measures to counter these attacks are necessary. In this paper, we provide an overview of the secure routing protocols for multi-hop networks and classify them into MCN Type-1 and Type-0 categories for device-to-device communications, and the Internet-of-Things category for machine-to-machine communications. Our focus is on the applied cryptographic techniques and the security mechanisms in secure routing protocols. We propose an evaluation framework incorporating different security aspects, vulnerabilities, and levels of deployability to compare a number of secure routing protocols. Moreover, we review the secure routing paths in software-defined networking as a solution for existing challenges in multi-hop networks. Some open research problems are highlighted as possible directions for future studies.},

abstract={Today, the Internet security community largely emphasizes cyberspace monitoring for the purpose of generating cyber intelligence. In this paper, we present a survey on darknet. The latter is an effective approach to observe Internet activities and cyber attacks via passive monitoring. We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities. Last but not least, our survey identifies specific darknet areas, such as IPv6 darknet, event monitoring, and game engine visualization methods that require a significantly greater amount of attention from the research community.},

Given that cloud services are prevalent today, it is critical to devise systems that detect intrusions. One form of security breach in the cloud is when cyber-criminals compromise Virtual Machines (VMs) of unwitting users and, then, utilize user resources to run time-consuming, malicious, or illegal applications for their own benefit. This work proposes a method to detect unusual resource usage trends and alert the user and the administrator in real time. We experiment with three categories of methods: simple statistical techniques, unsupervised classification, and regression. So far, our approach successfully detects anomalous resource usage when experimenting with typical trends synthesized from published real-world web server logs and cluster traces. We observe the best results with unsupervised classification, which gives an average F1-score of 0.83 for web server logs and 0.95 for the cluster traces.},

abstract={The problem of extracting the highest possible amount of key-related information using the lowest possible number of measurements is one of the central questions in side-channel attacks against embedded implementations of cryptographic algorithms. To address it, this work proposes a novel framework enhancing side-channel collision attacks with divide-and-conquer attacks such as differential power analysis (DPA). An information-theoretical metric is introduced for the evaluation of collision detection efficiency. Improved methods of dimension reduction for side-channel traces are developed based on a statistical model of euclidean distance. Experimental results confirm that DPA-combined collision attacks are superior to both DPA-only and collision-only attacks. The new methods of dimension reduction lead to further complexity improvements. All attacks are treated for the case of AES-128 and are practically validated on a widespread 8-bit RISC microcontroller.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) decouples the control plane and the data plane and solves the difficulty of new services deployment. However, the threat of a single point of failure is also introduced at the same time. The attacker can launch DDoS attacks towards the controller through switches. In this paper, a DDoS attack detection method based on information entropy and deep learning is proposed. Firstly, suspicious traffic can be inspected through information entropy detection by the controller. Then, fine-grained packet-based detection is executed by the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish between normal traffic and attack traffic. Finally, the controller performs the defense strategy to intercept the attack. The experiments indicate that the accuracy of this method reaches 98.98%, which has the potential to detect DDoS attack traffic effectively in the SDN environment.},

abstract={Monitoring all the internal flows in a datacenter is important to protect a victim against internal distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Unused virtual machines (VMs) in a datacenter are used as monitors and flows are copied to the monitors from software defined networking (SDN) switches by adding some special rules. In such a system, a VM runs a machine learning method to detect DDoS behavior but it can only process a limited number/amount of flows. When the amount of flows is beyond the capacities of all monitor VMs, the system sub-samples each flow probabilistically. The sampling rate affects the DDoS detection rate of the monitors. Besides, the DDoS detection rates of different types of flows are different for the same sampling rate. A uniform sampling rate might not produce a good overall DDoS detection rate. Assigning different sampling rates to different flows may produce the best result. In this paper, we propose a flow grouping approach based on behavioral similarity among the VMs followed by hierarchical clustering of VMs. The sampling rate is uniform among all the flows in a group. We investigate the relationship between the sampling rate and the DDoS detection rate. Then, we formulate an optimization problem for finding an optimal sampling rate distribution and solve it using mix-integer linear programming. We conduct extensive experiments with Hadoop and Spark and present results that support the feasibility of our model.},

abstract={Research and processing development on satellite communications has strongly re-emerged in recent years. Following the prosperity of various wireless services provided by satellite communications, the security issue has raised growing concerns since the space information network is susceptible to be eavesdropped by illegal adversaries in such a large-scale wireless network. Recently, the physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as an alternative security paradigm that explores the randomness of the wireless channel to achieve confidentiality and authentication. The success story of the PLS technique now spans a decade and thrives to provide a layer of defense in satellite communications. With this position, a comprehensive survey of satellite communications is conducted in this article with an emphasis on PLS. We first briefly introduce essential background and the view of the satellite Internet of Things (IoT), as well as discuss related research challenges faced by the emerging integrated network architecture. Then, we revisit the most popular satellite channel model influenced by many factors and list the commonly used secrecy performance metrics. Also, we provide an exhaustive review of state-of-the-art research activity on PLS in satellite communications, which we categorize by different architectures including land mobile satellite communication networks, hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay networks, and satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. In addition, a number of open research problems are identified as possible future research directions.},

abstract={Malicious domain names are consistently changing. It is challenging to keep blacklists of malicious domain names up-to-date because of the time lag between its creation and detection. Even if a website is clean itself, it does not necessarily mean that it won't be used as a pivot point to redirect users to malicious destinations. To address this issue, this paper demonstrates how to use linkage analysis and open-source threat intelligence to visualize the relationship of malicious domain names whilst verifying their categories, i.e., drive-by download, unwanted software etc. Featured by a graph-based model that could present the inter-connectivity of malicious domain names in a dynamic fashion, the proposed approach proved to be helpful for revealing the group patterns of different kinds of malicious domain names. When applied to analyze a blacklisted set of URLs in a real enterprise network, it showed better effectiveness than traditional methods and yielded a clearer view of the common patterns in the data.},

abstract={The previous study has shown that universal adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks over a large set of input images with a single human-invisible perturbation. However, current methods for universal adversarial attacks are based on additive perturbation, which cause misclassification when the perturbation is directly added to the input images. In this paper, for the first time, we show that a universal adversarial attack can also be achieved via non-additive perturbation (e.g., spatial transformation). More importantly, to unify both additive and non-additive perturbations, we propose a novel unified yet flexible framework for universal adversarial attacks, called GUAP, which is able to initiate attacks by additive perturbation, non-additive perturbation, or the combination of both. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset with several deep neural network models including GoogLeNet, VGG and ResNet. The empirical experiments demonstrate that GUAP can obtain up to 99.24% successful attack rate on ImageNet dataset, leading to over 19% improvements than current state-of-the-art universal adversarial attacks. The code for reproducing the experiments in this paper is available at https://github.com/TrustAI/GUAP.},

abstract={Software defined networking (SDN) decouples the control plane from the data plane of forwarding devices. This separation provides several benefits, including the simplification of network management and control. However, due to a variety of reasons, such as budget constraints and fear of downtime, many organizations are reluctant to fully deploy SDN. Partially deploying SDN through the placement of a limited number of SDN devices among legacy (traditional) network devices, forms a so called hybrid SDN network. While hybrid SDN networks provide many of the benefits of SDN and have a wide range of applications, they also pose several challenges. These challenges have recently been addressed in a growing body of literature on hybrid SDN network structures and protocols. This paper presents a comprehensive up-to-date survey of the research and development in the field of hybrid SDN networks. We have organized the survey into five main categories, namely hybrid SDN network deployment strategies, controllers for hybrid SDN networks, protocols for hybrid SDN network management, traffic engineering mechanisms for hybrid SDN networks, as well as testing, verification, and security mechanisms for hybrid SDN networks. We thoroughly survey the existing hybrid SDN network studies according to this taxonomy and identify gaps and limitations in the existing body of research. Based on the outcomes of the existing research studies as well as the identified gaps and limitations, we derive guidelines for future research on hybrid SDN networks.},

abstract={As devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) increase in number and integrate with everyday lives, large amounts of personal information will be generated. With multiple discovered vulnerabilities in current IoT networks, a malicious attacker might be able to get access to and misuse this personal data. Thus, a logger that stores this information securely would make it possible to perform forensic analysis in case of such attacks that target valuable data. In this paper, we propose LogSafe, a scalable, fault-tolerant logger that leverages the use of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to store logs from IoT devices efficiently and securely. Using the security guarantees of SGX, LogSafe is designed to run on an untrusted cloud infrastructure and satisfies Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) security properties. Finally, we provide an exhaustive evaluation of LogSafe in order to demonstrate that it is capable of handling logs from a large number of IoT devices and at a very high data transmission rate.},

abstract={As computing systems are increasingly shared among different users or application domains, researchers have intensified their efforts to detect possible data leaks. In particular, many investigations highlight the vulnerability of systems w.r.t. covert and side channel attacks. However, the effort required to reproduce and compare different results has proven to be high. Therefore, we present a novel methodology for covert channel evaluation. In addition, we introduce the Experiment Orchestration Toolkit ExOT, which provides software tools to efficiently execute the methodology.Our methodology ensures that the covert channel analysis yields expressive results that can be reproduced and allow the comparison of the threat potential of different data leaks. ExOT is a software bundle that consists of easy to extend C++ libraries and Python packages. These libraries and packages provide tools for the generation and execution of experiments, as well as the analysis of the experimental data. Therefore, ExOT decreases the engineering effort needed to execute our novel methodology. We verify these claims with an extensive evaluation of four different covert channels on an Intel Haswell and an ARMv8 based platform. In our evaluation, we derive capacity bounds and show achievable throughputs to compare the threat potential of these different covert channels.},

year={2019},
volume={27},
number={5},
pages={1815-1829},
abstract={We consider the online shortest path routing (SPR) of a network with stochastically time varying link states under potential adversarial attacks. Due to the denial of service (DoS) attacks, the distributions of link states could be stochastic (benign) or adversarial at different temporal and spatial locations. Without any a priori, designing an adaptive and optimal DoS-proof SPR protocol to thwart all possible adversarial attacks is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we present the first such integral solution based on the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, where jamming is the adversarial strategy. By introducing a novel control parameter into the exploration phase for each link, a martingale inequality is applied in our formulated combinatorial adversarial MAB framework. The proposed algorithm could automatically detect the specific jammed and un-jammed links within a unified framework. As a result, the adaptive online SPR strategies with near-optimal learning performance in all possible regimes are obtained. Moreover, we propose the accelerated algorithms by multi-path route probing and cooperative learning among multiple sources, and study their implementation issues. Comparing to existing works, our algorithm has the respective 30.3% and 87.1% improvements of network delay for oblivious jamming and adaptive jamming given a typical learning period and a 81.5% improvement of learning duration under a specified network delay on average, while it enjoys almost the same performance without jamming. Lastly, the accelerated algorithms can achieve a maximal of 150.2% improvement in network delay and a 431.3% improvement in learning duration.},

In this work, we demonstrate a novel network isolation attack in SDN networks, called Network Harvesting, that lets an attacker can access to the user's network privileges without the awareness of victim and OpenFlow SDN architecture, which significantly increases persistence. We then present a defense, SpoofDefender, that prevents network isolation attacks or other spoofing attacks by leveraging SDN's data and control plane separation, global network view, and programmatic control of the network, while building upon IEEE 802.1x and encryption. In addition, we also implement SpoofDefender on ONOS 1.10.4 and Mininet with a real network, and extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed SpoofDefender is highly effective in terms of computation and communication costs.},

In order to deal with the single point of failure on SDN controller caused by DDoS attacks, we propose a framework for detection and defense of DDoS attacks in the SDN environment. Firstly, we deploy a trigger mechanism of DDoS attack detection on data plane to screen for abnormal flows in the network. Then, we use a combined machine learning algorithm based on K-Means and KNN to exploit the rate characteristics and asymmetry characteristics of the flows and to detect the suspicious flows determined by the detection trigger mechanism. Finally, the controller will take corresponding actions to defense against the attacks. In this paper, we propose a new framework of cooperative detection methods of control plane and data plane, which effectively improve the detection accuracy and efficiency, and prevent DDoS attacks on SDN.},

abstract={One of the key enablers of the digital society is a highly reliable information infrastructure that can ensure resiliency to a wide range of failures and attacks. In cloud networks, replicas of various content are located at geographically distributed data centers, thus inherently enhancing cloud network reliability through diversification and redundancy of user accessibility to the content. However, cloud networks rely on optical network infrastructure which can be a target of deliberate link cuts that may cause service disruption on a massive scale. This paper investigates the dependency between the extent of damage caused by link cuts and a particular replica placement solution, as a fundamental prerequisite of resilient cloud network design that lacks systematic theoretical quantification and understanding. To quantify the vulnerability of optical cloud networks based on anycast communication to targeted link cuts, we propose a new metric called Average Content Accessibility (ACA). Using this metric, we analyze the impact of the number and the placement of content replicas on cloud network resiliency and identify the best and the worst case scenarios for networks of different sizes and connectivity. We evaluate the efficiency of simultaneous and sequential targeted link cuts, the latter reassessing link criticality between subsequent cuts to maximize disruption. Comparison with Average Two-Terminal Reliability (A2TR), an existing robustness measure for unicast networks, shows great discrepancy in the vulnerability results, indicating the need for new measures tailored to anycast-based networks.},

SDN aims to efficiently transform network architecture and operations to be agile, and effectively enrich the functionality of underlying network elements, such as routers and switches, by decoupling the control plane from the data plane. In SDN, the network intelligence is centralized in a software entity so-called SDN controller, which enables network administrators to dynamically manage, secure, and optimize network resources and programmatically shape all entire network traffic pattern. Despite the impressive benefits SDN has brought to network architecture, it introduces new security challenges and prompts different implementation strategies to spread attack vectors.

We conduct the first study that surveys the literature related to social authentication. In this paper, we not only created a taxonomy for classifying all social authentication schemes deployed in online or physical social contexts and extensively analyzed their authentication features, but also built a novel framework for evaluating the effectiveness of all social authentication schemes, identified all the practical and theoretical attacks that may be mounted against such schemes, addressed possible defense strategies, and identified challenges, open questions, and future research opportunities. To measure their accuracy, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, as well as to identify the potential of knowledge-based and trust-based social authentication schemes, a comprehensive comparative assessment of the security, usability, and deployability was conducted. We hope, by providing a solid foundation for gaining sufficient understanding of the manners in which users' social interactions have been utilized in user authentication schemes and their corresponding security implications, we will guide future research in this domain.},

abstract={Generating adversarial examples in a black-box setting retains a significant challenge with vast practical application prospects. In particular, existing black-box attacks suffer from the need for excessive queries, as it is non-trivial to find an appropriate direction to optimize in the high-dimensional space. In this paper, we propose Projection & Probability-driven Black-box Attack (PPBA) to tackle this problem by reducing the solution space and providing better optimization. For reducing the solution space, we first model the adversarial perturbation optimization problem as a process of recovering frequency-sparse perturbations with compressed sensing, under the setting that random noise in the low-frequency space is more likely to be adversarial. We then propose a simple method to construct a low-frequency constrained sensing matrix, which works as a plug-and-play projection matrix to reduce the dimensionality. Such a sensing matrix is shown to be flexible enough to be integrated into existing methods like NES and BanditsTD. For better optimization, we perform a random walk with a probability-driven strategy, which utilizes all queries over the whole progress to make full use of the sensing matrix for a less query budget. Extensive experiments show that our method requires at most 24% fewer queries with a higher attack success rate compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the attack method is evaluated on the real-world online service, i.e., Google Cloud Vision API, which further demonstrates our practical potentials.},

abstract={Botnet is considered a dangerous threat that could harm internet users as it makes the compromised host becomes under the control of the botmaster and follow its commands to perform a wide range of malicious activities such as distributed denial of service (DDOS), spamming, identity theft, click fraud, and phishing attacks. Several kinds of botnets exist such as Remote access Trojans/Remote administration tool (RATs) which are malware packages that are designed as advanced persistent threats (APT) for targeted attacks, e.g. stealing sensitive business and personal information or damaging the victim machine. The severity of this kind of bots is that they can evade detection strategies and security countermeasures that are taken by users resulting in serious damages for the infected hosts. Two methods in detection techniques are commonly used either the detection of the botnet at the network level or Identifying botnet behavior at the host level. In network-based detection, the network traffic is captured and analyzed for detecting the infected hosts. On the one hand, when the network traffic is encrypted, the botnet detection becomes tedious. On the other hand, monitoring the network traffic may raise concerns about data privacy. In host-based detection, the system behavior of each host is monitored to detect any botnet-related suspicious behaviors. The main disadvantages of host-based methods are their vulnerability to host-resident and stealthy malware, as well as the difficulties presented in installing the monitored systems in each host in the network. Accordingly, several researches use a hybrid methodology for combining the advantages of both techniques. In this paper, a survey is introduced for the most common botnet types and their detection strategies.},

abstract={Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a distributed platform to enhance the security of Internet of Things (IoT). The history of communications is stored in blockchain which introduces auditability. On the flip side, new privacy risks are introduced as the entire history of IoT device communication is exposed to participants. We study the likelihood of classifying IoT devices by analyzing the temporal patterns of their transactions, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its kind. We apply machine learning algorithms on blockchain data to analyze the success rate of device classification. Our results demonstrate success rates over 90% in classifying devices. We propose three timestamp obfuscation methods, namely combining multiple packets into a single transaction, merging ledgers of multiple devices, and randomly delaying transactions, to reduce the success rate in classifying devices which reduce the classification success rates to as low as 24%.},

abstract={User privacy is an extremely important concern for mobile applications. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has penalized multiple mobile application developers, such as TikTok and BabyBus for violating privacy regulations. Privacy concerns are more critical for children, who do not comprehend the risks associated with transmitting private information like geospatial location. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is an online privacy regulation platform to monitor data usage by mobile applications designed for children. Existing research on detecting whether an application complies with certain privacy regulations is performed either by analyzing the application binary or by dynamic monitoring of network at runtime. However, as explained in related work, both methods have their respective demerits. We propose COPPTCHA, a Hardware performance counter (HPC)-based technique to detect whether a children's app abides by the COPPA regulations. HPCs are special purpose registers found in all processors that measure system level events. Since the proposed method is hardware-based, it is difficult to undermine it compared to software-based COPPA compliance detection. COPPTCHA has no hardware overhead, since HPC data collection is integral to all industry standard processors. The HPC readings of applications running on a smartphone are classified using machine learning based classifiers to detect COPPA compliance. Our experiments employing a Moto-G4 smartphone shows that COPPTCHA can detect COPPA-violating apps with ≥ 99% accuracy.},

abstract={The major function of sensor networks is to gather the data from various sensor nodes which are used to transmit the data at different base stations. Due to fault or presence of malicious node in the network, collected data might be wrong or hijacked. It is important and difficult to detect the unsafe work done by any malicious node. There are many factors involved such as packet delivery ratio, jamming signal, tempering, which help to defend against malicious node or to detect the malicious node. In this paper, malicious node detection based on packet delivery ratio (PDR) has been proposed. The packets in network must reach the destination in order to provide the reliability in network, but the malicious nodes may tamper some of the packets and make the communication fail. Total number of packets sent by the sender may or may not be received by the receiver and it depends on whether there is any malicious node present or not in the network. So one can use this delivered packet information and calculate the packet delivery ratio to find out the malicious node. Simulation in this paper shows that the proposed scheme finds the malicious nodes in the network in efficient and effective manner.},

abstract={With the widespread applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), e.g., smart city, business, healthcare, etc., the security of data and devices becomes a major concern. Although blockchain can effectively enhance the network security and achieve fault tolerance, the huge resource consumption and limited performance of data processing restrict its deployments in IoT scenarios. Observing the heterogeneity and resource constraints, we intend to make blockchain accommodate both wimpy and brawny IoT devices. In this article, we present Tornado, a high-performance blockchain system based on space-structured ledger and corresponding algorithms, to enable blockchain in IoT. Specifically, we first design a space-structured chain architecture with novel data structures for promoting the network scalability. To address the huge heterogeneity of IoT, a novel consensus mechanism named collaborative-proof of work is developed. Moreover, we propose the space-structured greedy heaviest-observed subtree (S2GHOST) protocol for improving the resource efficiency of IoT devices. Additionally, a dynamic weight assignment mechanism in S2GHOST contributes to reflect the trustworthiness of data and devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tornado can achieve a maximum throughput of 3464.76 transactions per second. The optimizations of propagation latency and resource efficiency are 68.14% and 30.56%, respectively.},

abstract={The advancement of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently, there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources-memory, power, and computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users. However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station) that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology, narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT, subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques “zonal thermal pattern analysis” and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system have been proposed towards green IoT.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of human body pose estimation from depth data. Previous works Based on random forests relied either on a classification strategy to infer the different body parts or on a regression approach to predict directly the joint positions. To permit the inference of very generic poses, those approaches did not consider additional information during the learning phase, e.g. the performed activity. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach to integrate additional information at training time that actually improves the pose prediction during the testing. Our main contribution is a multi-task forest that aims at solving a joint regression-classification task: each foreground pixel from a depth image is associated to its relative displacements to the 3D joint positions as well as the activity class. Integrating activity information in the objective function during forest training permits a better partitioning of the 3D pose space that leads to a better modelling of the posterior. Thereby, our approach provides an improved pose prediction, and as a by-product, can give an estimate of the performed activity. We performed experiments on a dataset performed by 10 people associated with the ground truth body poses from a motion capture system. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, poses are divided into 10 different activities for the training phase. Results on this dataset show that our multi-task forest provides improved human pose estimation compared to a pure regression forest approach.},

Client virtual machine (VM) instances running on the same physical machine are susceptible to side-channel and escape-to-hypervisor attacks. Timely detection/mitigation of intrusive behaviors of malicious processes using signature based intrusion detection technologies or system call level anomaly analysis due to high false alarm rate presents a challenging task. In this work, a behavioral modeling scheme is proposed to detect suspicious processes on the highest semantic level.

abstract={Software-Defined WSNs (SDWSNs) have attracted considerable attention as they can provide more flexible network management compared with traditional WSNs. However, they also bring a new security issue, i.e., a sensor node can be easily compromised and behave maliciously to perform arbitrary action, e.g., dropping received messages, that degrades the availability of SDWSNs without being detected. To address the security issue, we propose a Hierarchical Trust Management scheme, named HTM. In HTM, a reputation-based mechanism is designed and utilized for detecting sensor nodes' malicious behavior, such as black-hole attack (dropping all received packets), selective forwarding attack (dropping partially received packets and forwarding the rest), and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack (sending abundant but useless packets continuously). At each level of the hierarchical system, the trustworthy of each node is evaluated and the malicious behavior is detected. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that the HTM scheme is capable to detect malicious nodes that perform the aforementioned attacks.},

abstract={Mobile devices equipped with rich sensors, such as smartphones, watches, or vehicles, have been pervasively used all around the world. Their high penetration and powerful sensing ability enable them to carry out heavy sensing projects by splitting tasks into small pieces. Since ordinary participants can simply employ their mobile devices to sense and upload the required data, the mobile crowdsensing (MCS) technology is gaining great popularity. However, there are still some challenges in building a complete and sustainable MCS system. Researchers these years have proposed plenty of strategies to solve these challenges in order to improve the MCS technology. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive literature review on recent advances in MCS. Oriented to the data flowing in MCS projects, we survey researches from five popular aspects in three stages: 1) incentive mechanism; 2) security protection; and 3) privacy preserving, together with resource optimization in the data collection stage; the data analysis stage; and the data application stage. To provide the convenience to interested researchers, some available testbeds, simulators, and commercial service platforms are also summarized in this survey. As the MCS technology still needs further development, we discuss some lessons learned from introduced researches as well as future research directions at last.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest emerging networking paradigms enabling a large number of applications for the benefit of mankind. Advancements in embedded system technology and compressed IPv6 have enabled the support of IP stack in resource constrained heterogeneous smart devices. However, global connectivity and resource constrained characteristics of smart devices have exposed them to different insider and outsider attacks, which put users' security and privacy at risk. Various risks associated with IoT slow down its growth and become an obstruction in the worldwide adoption of its applications. In RFC 6550, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network (RPL) is specified by IETF's ROLL working group for facilitating efficient routing in 6LoWPAN networks, while considering its limitations. Due to resource constrained nature of nodes in the IoT, RPL is vulnerable to many attacks that consume the node's resources and degrade the network's performance. In this paper, we present a study on various attacks and their existing defense solutions, particularly to RPL. Open research issues, challenges, and future directions specific to RPL security are also discussed. A taxonomy of RPL attacks, considering the essential attributes like resources, topology, and traffic, is shown for better understanding. In addition, a study of existing cross-layered and RPL specific network layer based defense solutions suggested in the literature is also carried out.},

abstract={The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet, and as such it is widely relied upon by a large part of the world. Consequently, it can be abused for multiple purposes, with financial gain being perhaps the most obvious, and important. An important countermeasure to such criminal and malicious activity is to identify involved domains, in order to blacklist or otherwise disable them. In this paper we provide the results of studying existing work on detecting malicious domains and analyse the findings. We identify an approach which is promising but has received surprisingly little attention; Pre-registration detection. We identify the following gaps between the problem of domain abuse, and the described state-of-the-art: Existing work on Pre-registration is strictly focused on a single form of abuse, spam, hence it must be explored if Pre-registration detection can be applied to other forms of abuse as well. Existing work, on both Pre- and Post-registration detection, is focused on a few Top-Level domains (TLDs) and Registries, prompting for studies with other TLDs and Registries. There is relevant information, including Registrant-based features, that has not yet been used for Pre-registration detection - which also calls for investigation. Finally, a study of a real-world deployment of Pre- registration detection at a Registry has not yet been presented, despite the potential of the approach. We contribute with an analysis of existing work, by identifying the state-of-the-art, and by identifying important areas of future work.},

abstract={Alluxio is a popular distributed memory storage system, which becomes increasingly important in big data ecosystem by providing high performance storage for computing framework. We point out that there are security vulnerabilities in cache mechanism, data short-circuit read/write mechanism and consistency check mechanism of Alluxio, which may result in the failure of data availability and integrity. Firstly, we find that the lack of limitation of cached copies in the cache mechanism causes the malicious memory consumption attack. An adversary can craft a malicious job to consume the scarce memory storage at a low cost, which will significantly influence the performance of normal users with a degradation of 20%-59%. Secondly, we are aware that the lack of access control and integrity check on the data block will lead to target file tamper attack, in which a target file cached in memory will be modified and considered correctly as long as the size remains unchanged. The tampered file will be read and thus causes a wrong result. Finally, we discuss some corresponding countermeasures for defending these two kinds of memory cache attacks.},

The supervised methods used for this in the literature need data labeling, which is a time and cost-intensive procedure. In this paper, we propose Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for monitoring the progress of the rehabilitation, utilizing the kinematic data from a Wearable Sensor System (WSS). The WSS provides three-dimensional linear acceleration and angular velocity from multiple body parts such as the lower back and lower limbs during walking at any speed on level ground. Twelve patients with hip unilateral arthroplasty completed two weeks of gait training after the operation. The classification results of different Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placements revealed that the IMU placed at thigh achieved the highest accuracy. The proposed DCNN achieved up to 98% classification accuracy for the rehabilitation progress monitoring. This approach provides an objective and evidence-based way of understanding clinically important changes in human movement patterns in response to exercise therapy.},

abstract={Carriers are rolling out Internet of Things (IoT) services including various IoT devices and use scenarios. Compared with conventional non-IoT devices such as smartphones and tablets, IoT devices have limited network capabilities (e.g., low rates) and specific use scenarios (e.g., inside vehicles only). These specialized use scenarios lead to carries often offering cheaper device access fees for IoT devices. However, the aforementioned disparity of service charging between IoT and non-IoT devices may lead to security issues. In this work, we conduct the first empirical security study on cellular IoT service charging over two major US carriers and make three major contributions. First, we discover four security vulnerabilities and analyze their root causes, which help us identify two significant security threats, IoT masquerading and IoT use scenario abuse. Second, we devise three proof-of-concept attacks and assess their real-world impact. We determine that they can be exploited to allow adversaries to pay 43.75-80.00 percent less for cellular data services. Third, we analyze the challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities and develop an anti-abuse solution to mitigate attack incentives. The solution is standard-compliant and can be used immediately in practice. Our prototype and evaluation confirm its effectiveness.},

pages={2413-2420},
abstract={Today's standard object localization systems often do not meet the industry's demands regarding 2D and 3D accuracy for digital manufacturing applications. Two targets are considered: digital-based assistance and robotic inspection. 2D precision is necessary to provide accurate assistance whilst 3D precision is crucial to get an inspection as much close to the object's true state. In this letter, we propose a new pose estimation system which ensures highest both 2D and 3D precision. While most RGB-based solutions focus on obtaining best 2D accuracy, RGBD-based systems mainly use depth information to maximize 3D accuracy. Very few solutions propose a way to jointly optimize both constraints. Nonetheless, pose estimation should produce high accuracy as a slight 2D error can result in a large 3D error (and inversely). To address this problem, we present a new system which uses RGB-D to fully take advantage of the depth information. A new 3D primitive is proposed in order to minimize the effect of RGB-D noise on 3D coordinates accuracy. CNN Keypoint Detector (KPD) method is used to localize this new primitive in order to achieve pose estimation task. Finally, we propose a novel refinement method which ensures optimal precision as both RGB and depth information are fused. We show the results of our experimentation on widely-used and challenging Linemod and Occlusion datasets. We demonstrate that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art methods when taking into account both 3D and 2D accuracy.},

abstract={Live virtual machine (VM) migration is commonly used for enabling dynamic resource or fault management, or for load balancing in datacenters or cloud platforms. A service hosted by a VM may also be migrated to prevent its visibility to an external adversary who may seek to disrupt its operation by launching a DDoS attack against it. We first show that current systems cannot adequately hide a VM migration from an external adversary. The key reason for this is that a migration typically manifests a traffic pattern with distinguishable statistical properties. We introduce two new attacks that can allow an adversary to effectively track a migration in progress, by leveraging observations of these properties. As our primary contribution, we design and implement a stealth migration framework that causes migration traffic to be indistinguishable from regular Internet traffic, with a negligible latency overhead of approximately 0.37 seconds, on average.},

Furthermore, we show that such attacks can become even worse if sophisticated attackers exploit motion sensors to cluster the magnetometer or orientation data, improving the accuracy to as high as 98%. To mitigate such attacks, we propose a noise injection scheme that can effectively reduce the App sniffing accuracy to only 15% and at the same time has negligible effect on benign Apps.},

abstract={As the Internet has entered everyday life and become tightly bound to telephony, both in the form of Voice over IP technology as well as Internet-enabled cellular devices, several attacks have emerged that target both landline and mobile devices. We present a variation of an existing attack, that exploits smart phone devices to launch a DoS attack against a telephone device by issuing a large amount of missed calls. In that light, we conduct an excessive study of Phone CAPTCHA usage for preventing attacks that render telephone devices unusable, and provide information on the design and implementation of our system that protects landline devices. Subsequently, we propose the integration of Phone CAPTCHAs in smart phone software as a countermeasure against a series of attacks that target such devices. We also present various enhancements to strengthen CAPTCHAs against automated attacks. Finally, we conduct a user study to measure the applicability of our enhanced Phone CAPTCHAs.},

abstract={Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.},

Thus it is essential to begin assessing their cyber-risk profiles in order to rank and mitigate any vulnerabilities.

abstract={Nowadays, many computer and communication systems generate graph data. Graph data span many different domains, ranging from online social network data from networks like Facebook to epidemiological data used to study the spread of infectious diseases. Graph data are shared regularly for many purposes including academic research and for business collaborations. Since graph data may be sensitive, data owners often use various anonymization techniques that often compromise the resulting utility of the anonymized data. To make matters worse, there are several state-of-the-art graph data de-anonymization attacks that have proven successful in recent years. In this paper, we survey the graph data anonymization, de-anonymization, and de-anonymizability quantification techniques in the past decade. Specifically, we systematically classify, summarize, and analyze state-of-the-art graph data anonymization, de-anonymization, and de-anonymizability quantification techniques. For existing graph data anonymization techniques, we classify them into six categories and analyze their utility performance with respect to 15 fundamental graph utility metrics and seven high-level application utility metrics. For existing de-anonymization attacks, we classify them into two categories and examine their performance with respect to scalability, practicability, robustness, etc. We also analyze the resistance of existing graph anonymization techniques against existing graph de-anonymizaiton attacks. For existing de-anonymizability quantifications, we classify them according to whether they consider seed information or not, and analyze them in terms of their soundness. Our analysis demonstrates that: 1) most anonymization schemes can partially or conditionally preserve most graph utility while losing some application utility and 2) state-of-the-art anonymization schemes are vulnerable to several or all of the emerging structure-based de-anonymization attacks. The actual vulnerability of each anonymization algorithm depends on how much and which data utility it preserves. Based on our summarization and analysis, we discuss the research evolution, future directions, and challenges in the research area of graph data anonymization, de-anonymization, and de-anonymizability quantification.},

abstract={This paper discusses a white matter lesion (WML) segmentation scheme for fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. The method computes the volume of lesions with subvoxel precision by accounting for the partial volume averaging (PVA) artifact. As WMLs are related to stroke and carotid disease, accurate volume measurements are most important. Manual volume computation is laborious, subjective, time consuming, and error prone. Automated methods are a nice alternative since they quantify WML volumes in an objective, efficient, and reliable manner. PVA is initially modeled with a localized edge strength measure since PVA resides in the boundaries between tissues. This map is computed in 3-D and is transformed to a global representation to increase robustness to noise. Significant edges correspond to PVA voxels, which are used to find the PVA fraction α (amount of each tissue present in mixture voxels). Results on simulated and real FLAIR images show high WML segmentation performance compared to ground truth (98.9% and 83% overlap, respectively), which outperforms other methods. Lesion load studies are included that automatically analyze WML volumes for each brain hemisphere separately. This technique does not require any distributional assumptions/parameters or training samples and is applied on a single MR modality, which is a major advantage compared to the traditional methods.},

Recent studies have shown the vulnerability of popular computing environments, such as cloud computing, to these covert timing channels. In this work, we propose a new micro architecture-level framework, CC-Hunter, that detects the possible presence of covert timing channels on shared hardware. Our experiments demonstrate that Chanter is able to successfully detect different types of covert timing channels at varying bandwidths and message patterns.},

abstract={In the world of internet and communication technologies where our personal and business lives are inextricably tied to internet enabled services and applications, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to adversely affect the availability of these services and applications. Many frameworks have been presented in academia and industry to predict, detect and defend against DDoS attacks. The available solutions try to protect online services from DDoS attacks, but as yet there is no best-practice method that is widely-accepted in the community. Differentiating DDoS attacks from similar looking legitimate Flash Events (FE) wherein huge numbers of legitimate users try to access a specific internet based service or application, is another challenging issue in the field. This paper proposes a novel hybrid DDoS and FE detection scheme taking three isolated approaches including Kernel Online Anomaly Detection (KOAD), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Information Theory. We applied our proposed approach on simulated DDoS attacks, real FEs and normal network traffic. The results indicate that information theory works well in combination with machine learning algorithms to detect and discriminate DDoS and FE traffic in terms of both false positive and detection rates.},

Hence, finding an appropriate security solution to protect node authentication and sensor data integrity which are two of the most critical security issues has always attracted researchers. In which, the digital watermarking technique can be used to secure sensory data while keeping a reasonable computation cost. However, nowadays, node clone attacks can create a war of inside attacks which damages heavily to the performance of sensor networks. Hence, the confidentiality and integrity of sensor network entities are raised more challenges related to complexity and practical problems. This paper proposes a novel lightweight mixed secure scheme based on watermarking techniques to protect sensory data and defend against node clone attacks. Numerical results and security analysis will be provided in the paper to validate the advantage of the proposed security protocol.},

abstract={The salient features of cloud computing (such as on-demand self-service, resource pooling, broad network access, rapid elasticity, and measured service) are being exploited by attackers to launch the severe Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Generally, the DDoS attacks in such an environment have been implemented by flooding a huge volume (high-rate) of malicious traffic to exhaust the victim servers’ resources. Due to this huge volume of malicious traffic, such attacks can be easily detected. Thus, attackers are getting attracted towards the low-rate DDoS attacks, slowly. Low-rate DDoS attacks are difficult to detect due to their stealthy and low-rate traffic. In the recent years, many efforts have been devoted to defend against the low-rate DDoS attacks. By utilizing the salient features of cloud computing, it becomes easy for an attacker to launch sophisticated low-rate DDoS attacks. Thus, the study of various DDoS attacks and their corresponding defense approaches becomes essential to protect the cloud infrastructure from fatal effects of DDoS attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of all the possible variants of cloud DDoS attacks solutions with detailed insight into the characterization, prevention, detection, and mitigation mechanisms. The paper provides a detailed discussion on essential performance metrics to evaluate various defense solutions and their behavior in a cloud environment. The purpose of this survey paper is to excite the cloud security researchers to develop effective defense solutions against the various DDoS attacks. The research gaps and challenges are found, and described in the paper while future research directions are outlined.},

abstract={Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are among the most common distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks today. Despite considerable effort made by both research and industry, our recent interviews with over 100 potential DDoS victims in over 10 industry segments indicate that today's DDoS prevention is far from perfect. On one hand, few academical proposals have ever been deployed in the Internet; on the other hand, solutions offered by existing DDoS prevention vendors are not silver bullet to defend against the entire attack spectrum. Guided by such large-scale study of today's DDoS defense, in this paper, we present MiddlePolice, the first readily deployable and proactive DDoS prevention mechanism. We carefully architect MiddlePolice such that it requires no changes from both the Internet core and the network stack of clients, yielding instant deployability in the current Internet architecture. Further, relying on our novel capability feedback mechanism, MiddlePolice is able to enforce destination-driven traffic control so that it guarantees to deliver victim-desired traffic regardless of the attacker strategies. We implement a prototype of MiddlePolice and demonstrate its feasibility via extensive evaluations in the Internet, hardware testbed, and large-scale simulations.},

abstract={We propose a method for estimating the image and video noises of different types: white Gaussian (signal-independent), mixed Poissonian-Gaussian (signal-dependent), or processed (non-white). Our method also estimates the noise level function (NLF) of these types. We do so by classifying image patches based on their intensity and variance in order to find homogeneous regions that best represent the noise. We assume that the noise variance is a piecewise linear function of intensity in each intensity class. To find noise representative regions, noisy (signal-free) patches are first nominated in each intensity class. Next, clusters of connected patches are weighted, where the weights are calculated based on the degree of similarity to the noise model. The highest ranked cluster defines the peak noise variance, and other selected clusters are used to approximate the NLF. The more information we incorporate, such as temporal data and camera settings, the more reliable the estimation becomes. To account for the processed noise, (i.e., remaining after in-camera processing), we consider the ratio of low-to-high-frequency energies. We address noise variations along video signals using a temporal stabilization of the estimated noise. Objective and subjective simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other noise estimation techniques, both in accuracy and speed.},

abstract={In the era of the mobile Internet, the problem of personal information leakage is becoming more and more serious. It is possible that third-parities (e.g., advertising companies, telecom operators) can easily obtain private user information by analyzing the Internet traffic flows to (or from) users. In this paper, in order to examine the degree of information leakage via the URLs, we propose an efficient Internet metadata analytics framework called URLSight, which attempts to profile user behaviors by simply analyzing the Internet metadata embedded in the URLs. Our analysis is based on a large dataset which contains one-month URL logs generated by around 100 thousand mobile users. After parsing and contextualizing URLs, URLSight can extract all the key-value pairs and perform co-occurrence processing to eliminate information redundancy. We also implement the URLSight framework on the Apache Spark platform to improve its performance. The results show that URLSight can effectively extract user privacy from URLs. Last, we also discuss a few practical approaches to defend against URL information leakage.},

pages={35792-35804},
abstract={Traditional deception-based cyber defenses (DCD) often adopt the static deployment policy that places the deception resources in some fixed positions in the target network. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these deception resources has been greatly restricted by the static deployment policy, which also causes the deployed deception resources to be easily identified and bypassed by attackers. Moreover, the existing studies on dynamic deployment policy, which make many strict assumptions and constraints, are too idealistic to be practical. To overcome this limitation, an intelligent deployment policy used to dynamically adjust the locations of these deception resources according to the network security state is developed. Starting with formulating the problem of deception resources deployment, we then model the attacker-defender scenario and the attacker's strategy. Next, the preliminary screening method that can derive the effective deployment locations of deception resources based on threat penetration graph (TPG) is proposed. Afterward, we construct the model for finding the optimal policy to deploy the deception resources using reinforcement learning and design the Q-Learning training algorithm with model-free. Finally, we use the real-world network environment for our experiments and conduct in-depth comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Our evaluations on a large number of attacks show that our method has a high defense success probability of nearly 80%, which is more efficient than existing schemes.},

Through this paper, we have augmented traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems with a trust framework whose reduction and redemption values are a function of the severity of the incident, the degree of connectivity of nodes and the time elapsed. A lightweight implementation on the nodes coupled with a multithreaded approach on the central trust server has shown the capability to scale to larger networks with high traffic volumes and a varying proportion of suspicious traffic patterns.},

These enable Alice to search Bob's data without revealing Alice's search criteria, sacrifice bandwidth (she doesn't have to tap the entire stream), or deploy a trusted device in Bob's domain. Building on two fixed-string retrieval techniques in [3] and [15], we developed a novel private pattern matching method that searches freeform, arbitrary length strings in streaming plaintext and retrieves corresponding elements. We present our design that encodes regular expressions into private queries, uses an obfuscation method to limit frequency and graph quotient attacks by Bob, and we provide experimental evidence to verify the feasibility of the approach. Our pattern matching technique extends the range of applications for plaintext PIR.},

abstract={Benchmarking can drive the development of technologies by facilitating standardization of features for comparison of different methods. While hardware security has seen an exponential growth in innovation throughout the last decade, the lack of sufficient benchmarks for data-driven analysis is prominent. Researchers must currently rely on decades-old VLSI benchmarks, which in most cases were not designed with security evaluation in mind. Considering the present day computational power, these benchmarks lack in both quality and quantity for usage in hardware security topics such as obfuscation and hardware Trojans. Many advanced techniques, like statistical analysis and machine learning, require a large number of samples in order to sufficiently examine the feature space. In an attempt to resolve this issue, we have developed the first synthetic benchmark generation process flow. This paper describes our novel technique that utilizes linear optimization to generate an endless number of synthetic combinational benchmarks that are adaptable to user input constraints and divergent in quantifiable structural features from input reference benchmarks. Thus, our framework offers customization for generating richer and more challenging benchmarks for data-driven hardware security. Through experimentation, we verify that our benchmarks offers more structural variation than the current benchmark suites.},

abstract={Nowadays more and more IoT devices, including a large number of IoT servers, have been deployed on the Internet. The security of IoT servers has always been a challenge. In this paper, a new model named addressless IoT server is proposed, which allows people to use the large IPv6 address space to protect IoT server security. The server is allocated an IPv6 prefix instead of an address. When the authenticated client initiates communication, it uses an encryption mechanism to generate a specific destination address under the prefix. The server verifies the destination address when receiving the packet, and discards the packet if the verification fails. In this way, the model can prevent attackers from perceiving the server and launching scans or attacks, while remains compatible with the current Internet. The prototype is implemented and an extensive set of experiments are conducted in this paper. The results demonstrate that the model can better protect server security.},

abstract={Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples which are carefully crafted instances to cause the models to make wrong predictions. While adversarial examples for 2D images and CNNs have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to 3D data such as point clouds. Given many safety-critical 3D applications such as autonomous driving, it is important to study how adversarial point clouds could affect current deep 3D models. In this work, we propose several novel algorithms to craft adversarial point clouds against PointNet, a widely used deep neural network for point cloud processing. Our algorithms work in two ways: adversarial point perturbation and adversarial point generation. For point perturbation, we shift existing points negligibly. For point generation, we generate either a set of independent and scattered points or a small number (1-3) of point clusters with meaningful shapes such as balls and airplanes which could be hidden in the human psyche. In addition, we formulate six perturbation measurement metrics tailored to the attacks in point clouds and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms on the ModelNet40 3D shape classification dataset. Overall, our attack algorithms achieve a success rate higher than 99% for all targeted attacks.},

abstract={We are living in an era when online communication over social network services (SNSs) have become an indispensable part of people's everyday lives. As a consequence, online social deception (OSD) in SNSs has emerged as a serious threat in cyberspace, particularly for users vulnerable to such cyberattacks. Cyber attackers have exploited the sophisticated features of SNSs to carry out harmful OSD activities, such as financial fraud, privacy threat, or sexual/labor exploitation. Therefore, it is critical to understand OSD and develop effective countermeasures against OSD for building trustworthy SNSs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive survey, covering 1) the multidisciplinary concept of social deception; 2) types of OSD attacks and their unique characteristics compared to other social network attacks and cybercrimes; 3) comprehensive defense mechanisms embracing prevention, detection, and response (or mitigation) against OSD attacks along with their pros and cons; 4) datasets/metrics used for validation and verification; and 5) legal and ethical concerns related to OSD research. Based on this survey, we provide insights into the effectiveness of countermeasures and the lessons learned from the existing literature. We conclude our survey with in-depth discussions on the limitations of the state-of-the-art and suggest future research directions in OSD research.},

abstract={Until now, an effective defense method against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is yet to be offered by security systems. Incidents of serious damage due to DDoS attacks have been increasing, thereby leading to an urgent need for new attack identification, mitigation, and prevention mechanisms. To prevent DDoS attacks, the basic features of the attacks need to be dynamically analyzed because their patterns, ports, and protocols or operation mechanisms are rapidly changed and manipulated. Most of the proposed DDoS defense methods have different types of drawbacks and limitations. Some of these methods have signature-based defense mechanisms that fail to identify new attacks and others have anomaly-based defense mechanisms that are limited to specific types of DDoS attacks and yet to be applied in open environments. Subsequently, extensive research on applying artificial intelligence and statistical techniques in the defense methods has been conducted in order to identify, mitigate, and prevent these attacks. However, the most appropriate and effective defense features, mechanisms, techniques, and methods for handling such attacks remain to be an open question. This review paper focuses on the most common defense methods against DDoS attacks that adopt artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. Additionally, the review classifies and illustrates the attack types, the testing properties, the evaluation methods and the testing datasets that are utilized in the methodology of the proposed defense methods. Finally, this review provides a guideline and possible points of encampments for developing improved solution models of defense methods against DDoS attacks.},

abstract={The abuse of chat services by automated programs, known as chat bots, poses a serious threat to Internet users. Chat bots target popular chat networks to distribute spam and malware. In this paper, we first conduct a series of measurements on a large commercial chat network. Our measurements capture a total of 16 different types of chat bots ranging from simple to advanced. Moreover, we observe that human behavior is more complex than bot behavior. Based on the measurement study, we propose a classification system to accurately distinguish chat bots from human users. The proposed classification system consists of two components: 1) an entropy-based classifier; and 2) a Bayesian-based classifier. The two classifiers complement each other in chat bot detection. The entropy-based classifier is more accurate to detect unknown chat bots, whereas the Bayesian-based classifier is faster to detect known chat bots. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed classification system is highly effective in differentiating bots from humans.},

pages={384-391},
abstract={Low-rate Denial of Service (LDoS) attack can greatly degrade the performance of the attacked service by exploiting the security vulnerability in the adaptive mechanism of network protocol. This attack is destructive and awfully covert. For the low accuracy and high complexity of the existing algorithms, this paper proposes a method of attack detection based on WPD-EE. When LDoS attack occurs, TCP congestion control is forced to trigger frequently, which causes a large number of packet loss, resulting in strong periodic fluctuations and discrete characteristics of TCP traffic. Based on the characteristics caused by this LDoS attack, wavelet packet decomposition is carried out for TCP traffic sequence analysis, and then the decomposed node coefficients are reconstructed, so that each signal can reflect the information of TCP traffic influencing factors. Through the calculation of the difference of energy entropy to analyze whether the traffic sequence has discrete characteristics, so as to realize the effective detection of LDoS. Due to the advantages of wavelet packet analysis for more detailed high-frequency signal processing, the method proposed in this paper has high accuracy. In this paper, NS-2 experimental platform, WIDE2018 dataset and TestBed are used for multiple experiments. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy and low false positive rate, which has better advantages than the other related algorithms, and can detect LDoS attack effectively.},

abstract={In recent decades, a significant research effort has been devoted to the development of forensic tools for retrieving information and detecting possible tampering of multimedia documents. A number of counter-forensic tools have been developed as well in order to impede a correct analysis. Such tools are often very effective due to the vulnerability of multimedia forensics tools, which are not designed to work in an adversarial environment. In this scenario, developing forensic techniques capable of granting good performance even in the presence of an adversary aiming at impeding the forensic analysis, is becoming a necessity. This turns out to be a difficult task, given the weakness of the traces the forensic analysis usually relies on. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the advances made over the last decade in the field of adversarial multimedia forensics. We first consider the view points of the forensic analyst and the attacker independently, then we review some of the attempts made to simultaneously take into account both perspectives by resorting to game theory. Eventually, we discuss the hottest open problems and outline possible paths for future research.},

Therefore, in order to consolidate and solidify the security and privacy in 6G networks, we survey how security may impact the envisioned 6G wireless systems, possible challenges with different 6G technologies, and the potential solutions. We provide our vision on 6G security and security key performance indicators (KPIs) with the tentative threat landscape based on the foreseen 6G network architecture. Moreover, we discuss the security and privacy challenges that may encounter with the available 6G requirements and potential 6G applications. We also give the reader some insights into the standardization efforts and research-level projects relevant to 6G security. In particular, we discuss the security considerations with 6G enabling technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), physical layer security, distributed AI/ML, visible light communication (VLC), THz, and quantum computing. All in all, this work intends to provide enlightening guidance for the subsequent research of 6G security and privacy at this initial phase of vision towards reality.},

abstract={Fine-grained access control is used to assign unique access privilege to a particular user for accessing the relevant information. Recently, Yu et al. and Ruj et al. proposed a couple of fine grained access control schemes using public key cryptography. These schemes exploit and maneuver the concept of KP-ABE and a cryptographic technique based on bilinear pairing on elliptive curve groups. In this paper, we first show that though these schemes are efficient, but both schemes suffer from some fatal weakness such as vulnerability against an insider attack, specifically key abuse attacks by the genuine users. Therefore, a user with lower access privilege can access the secret data sent for a user of higher access privilege. This contradicts the basic objective of fine grained access control. Also, information sent for a particular user can be revealed to an adversary. In order to remedy that weakness, we propose some simple countermeasures to prevent key-abuse insider attack while the merits of existing fine grained access control scheme are left unchanged. Further, our scheme is unconditionally secure against various attacks such as man-in-the-middle attack, replay attack and denial of service attack. While providing these extra security features, our scheme incurs no such extra communication, computation or storage overhead as compared to the existing schemes.},

Among the various factors affecting the security of a process plant, the layout of the plant may play a significant role, since the different parts of the installation may be more or less easily reached by a terrorist attack and present different potentials for causing a major accident, including the possibility of domino effects. The present work will focus on the influence of the layout of a process plant on its security and on its possible impact on the external environment: the different approaches will be critically examined to extract the essential information concerning this issue, in order to derive some general guidelines to support the choice of a layout contributing not only to the safety but also to the security of the installation. Study cases, relevant to some existing Italian installations, will be then examined to assess the efficacy of their layout from the security point of view.},

abstract={Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios and applications are envisioned to be supported by emerging 5G networks. In this context, complex routing schemes for pervasive infrastructures are highly simplified, as every hardware element may stablish its own communication link with a 5G base station. However, this situation also introduces new risks, especially in the security field where innovative cyber-physical attacks and distributed denial of service attacks are becoming more popular and dangerous each day. Thus, data authentication, protection and anonymization in those new applications and schemes is a key challenge to be addressed. Besides, most devices in future IoT systems will be resource constrained, so traditional solutions based on private keys stored in devices' memory and computationally heavy cryptographic algorithms will turn unsecure, inefficient or, directly, impossible to run. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new mechanism to protect, authenticate and anonymize data in IoT systems supported by future 5G networks. The proposed solution employs both digital watermarking techniques and lightweight cryptographic technologies. To generate keys in a secure and simple manner, physical unclonable functions are employed. Besides, to reduce as much as possible the computational cost of algorithms, chaotic dynamics will be considered. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution an experimental validation based on simulation techniques is also carried out.},

pages={53096-53122},
abstract={This paper presents the first, novel, dynamic, resilient, and consistent Blockchain COngestion ContrOL (BCOOL) system for vehicular networks that fills the gap of trustworthy Blockchain congestion prediction systems. BCOOL relies on the heterogeneity of Machine Learning, Software-Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization that is customized in three hybrid cloud/edge-based On/Offchain smart contract modules and ruled by an efficient and reliable communication protocol. BCOOL’s first novel module aims at managing message and vehicle trustworthiness using a novel, dynamic and hybrid Blockchain Fog-based Distributed Trust Contract Strategy (FDTCS). The second novel module accurately and proactively predicts the occurrence of congestion, ahead of time, using a novel Hybrid On/Off-Chain Multiple Linear Regression Software-defined Contract Strategy (HOMLRCS). This module presents a virtualization facility layer to the third novel K-means/Random Forest-based On/Off-Chain Dynamic Service Function Chaining Contract Strategy (KRF-ODSFCS) that dynamically, securely and proactively predicts VNF placements and their chaining order in the context of SFCs w.r.t users’ dynamic QoS priority demands. BCOOL exhibits a linear complexity and a strong resilience to failures. Simulation results show that BCOOL outperforms the next best comparable strategies by 80% and 100% reliability and efficiency gains in challenging data congestion environments. This yields to fast, reliable and accurate congestion prediction decisions, ahead of time, and optimizes transaction validation processing time. Globally, the Byzantine resilience, complexity and attack mitigation strategies along with simulation results prove that BCOOL securely predicts the congestion and provides real-time monitoring, fast and accurate SFC deployment decisions while lowering both capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX/OPEX) costs.},

abstract={With the remarkable success of deep learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied as dominant tools to various machine learning domains. Despite this success, however, it has been found that DNNs are surprisingly vulnerable to malicious attacks; adding a small, perceptually indistinguishable perturbations to the data can easily degrade classification performance. Adversarial training is an effective defense strategy to train a robust classifier. In this work, we propose to utilize the generator to learn how to create adversarial examples. Unlike the existing approaches that create a one-shot perturbation by a deterministic generator, we propose a recursive and stochastic generator that produces much stronger and diverse perturbations that comprehensively reveal the vulnerability of the target classifier. Our experiment results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the classifier adversarially trained with our method yields more robust performance over various white-box and black-box attacks.},

abstract={We establish the correlated networks of the listed companies, funds and their main holders and find that such networks are typical scale-free networks. The scale-free indices of the In-degree assets and Out-degree assets of the vertices indicate that the vertices, which represent the super-scale companies newly listed on the stock markets in 2006 and 2007, not only make the networks resources' re-arrangement, but also make the status of the previous In-hub vertices lower relatively. Then we study the 3-clique-communities of the networks by Directed Clique Percolation Method and the results are consistent with the fluctuations of scale-free indices. The super-scale companies newly listed on the stock markets can become the hub vertices quickly and strengthen the mutual investment relationships among the previous listed companies and funds. The large investment relationship between the large companies and their main holders are researched by removal method. We find that the mutual investment relationships among the large companies and funds are closer than the generally investments relationships every year, and the state-owned enterprises listing on the stock markets in 2006 and 2007 have succeeded to undergo the economic crisis and developed healthily. Finally, the robustness of the networks has been studied through three approaches, and the worldwide economic crisis is just the example of the random failure on the whole networks. The results show that the Chinese stock markets have good robustness at this condition. However, the networks show the obviously vulnerability if the stock markets meet the intentional attack.},

abstract={Historically, attackers have sought to manipulate programs through the corruption of return addresses, function pointers, and other control flow data. However, as protections like ASLR, stack canaries, and no-execute bits have made such attacks more difficult, data-oriented exploits have received increasing attention. Such exploits try to subvert a program by reading or writing non-control data, without introducing any foreign code or violating the program’s legitimate control flow graph. Recently, a data-oriented exploitation technique called memory cartography was introduced, in which an attacker navigates between allocated memory regions using a precompiled map to disclose sensitive program data. The efficacy of memory cartography is dependent on inter-region pointers being located at constant offsets within memory regions; thus, cartographic attacks are difficult to launch against memory regions like heaps and stacks that have nondeterministic layouts. In this paper, we lower the barrier to successful attacks against nondeterministic memory, demonstrating that pointers between regions of memory often possess unique “signatures” that allow attackers to identify them with high accuracy. These signatures are accurate even when the pointers reside in non-deterministic memory areas. In many real-world programs, this allows an attacker that is capable of reading bytes from a single heap to access all of process memory. Our findings underscore the importance of memory isolation via separate address spaces.},

This is generally performed by anonymization techniques such as triple suppression and generalization. Nevertheless, these techniques have the drawback of reducing the utility of the released datasets. This paper presents semantic anatomization, a novel anonymization technique, that retains all quasi-identifier and sensitive values in the RDF graph. Due to an aggregating mechanism and the exploitation of the semantics contained in ontologies, this technique preserves data correlation and supports high quality analysis from anonymized graphs. We demonstrate the potential of semantic anatomization on large graphs generated from our own extension of the well-established Lehigh university benchmark.},

abstract={Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, widely used for its perceived anonymity property, and has surged in popularity in recent years. Bitcoin publishes the complete transaction history in a public ledger, under pseudonyms of users. This is an alternative way to prevent double-spending attack instead of central authority. Therefore, if pseudonyms of users are attached to their identities in real world, the anonymity of Bitcoin will be a serious vulnerability. It is necessary to enhance anonymity of Bitcoin by a coin mixing service or other modifications in Bitcoin protocol. But in a coin mixing service, the relationship among input and output addresses is not hidden from the mixing service provider. So the mixing server still has the ability to track the transaction records of Bitcoin users. To solve this problem, We present a new coin mixing scheme to ensure that the relationship between input and output addresses of any users is invisible for the mixing server. We make use of a ring signature algorithm to ensure that the mixing server can't distinguish specific transaction from all these addresses. The ring signature ensures that a signature is signed by one of its users in the ring and doesn't leak any information about who signed it. Furthermore, the scheme is fully compatible with existing Bitcoin protocol and easily to scale for large amount of users.},

abstract={Software Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SDWSN) is realised by infusing Software Defined Network (SDN) model in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Reason for that is to overcome the challenges of WSN. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning play an important role in our society, give rise to systems that can manage themselves. WSNs have been used in various industrial applications, where reliability and network performance are critical success factors. Many advanced AI techniques can be utilised to improve the performance and reliability of these applications. Investigating the AI algorithms applied to SDN may bring improved network management, security or routing in SDWSN which may result in a more reliable network. We look at machine learning algorithms applied in SDN and discuss the possibility of using these AI in SDWSN to address the WSN challenges and improve its performance and reliability.},

abstract={Wireless networks are widely deployed in the present scenario. A type of wireless network, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous system of mobile nodes where a collection of mobile hosts with wireless network interfaces form a temporary network without the aid of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. The success of MANET strongly depends on its security. Security is an essential service for wireless network communications especially in mission-critical applications like military applications. A variety of attacks such as Warmhole, Blackhole, Byzantine, Rushing/Flooding, Anonymity/Location Disclosure, Denial of Service etc have been identified and some solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, existing published solutions typically concentrate on particular type of attacks and are incapable of identifying threats, which occur as a result of combination of these attacks. As overall security level is determined by the system's weakest point, a distributed security scheme that uses an integrated approach to address a combination of these attacks is very much necessary. The work in progress aims to investigate the possible combination of attacks that can be addressed by integrating some of the existing work on mobile ad hoc networks security, which addresses a portion of the security concerns individually. The analysis of attacks and existing mechanisms that would help to design an integrated approach for security services is presented in this paper.},

abstract={We propose a simple yet efficient steganalytic algorithm for watermarks embedded by two state-of-the-art 3D watermarking algorithms by Cho et al. The main observation is that while in a clean model the means/variances of Cho et al.’s normalized histogram bins are expected to follow a Gaussian distribution, in a marked model their distribution will be bimodal. The proposed algorithm estimates the number of bins through an exhaustive search and then the presence of a watermark is decided by a tailor made normality test or a $t$ -test. We also propose a modification of Cho et al.’s watermarking algorithms with the watermark embedded by changing the histogram of the radial coordinates of the vertices. Rather than targeting a continuous statistics such as the mean or variance of the values in a bin, the proposed watermarking modifies a discrete statistic, which here is the height of the histogram bin, to achieve watermark embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the modified algorithm offers not only better resistance against the steganalytic attack we developed, but also an improved robustness/capacity trade-off.},

abstract={The burgeoning technology of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is attracting the traditional Location-Based Service (LBS) and Location Service (LS) to deploy due to its nature characters such as low latency and location awareness. Although this transplant will avoid the location privacy threat from the central cloud provider, there still exist the privacy concerns in the LS of MEC scenario. Location privacy threat arises during the procedure of the fingerprint localization, and the previous studies on location privacy are ineffective because of the different threat model and information semantic. To address the location privacy in MEC environment, we designed LoPEC, a novel and effective scheme for protecting location privacy for the MEC devices. By the proper model of the Radio Access Network (RAN) access points, we proposed the noise-addition method for the fingerprint data, and successfully induce the attacker from recognizing the real location. Our evaluation proves that LoPEC effectively prevents the attacker from obtaining the user's location precisely in both single-point and trajectory scenarios.},

abstract={As cloud services using the virtualized technique are emerging and developing rapidly, protection of cloud services is a key issue. Most research efforts focus on reducing the attack surface observed by the external attackers, which is an impractical solution for a complex system like virtualized infrastructure. In order to deceive the attackers and waste their time and efforts, three attack surface expansion approaches for moving target defense are proposed in this paper. These three approaches provide different protection capability with different system complexity by using decoy virtual machines that co-exist with the real virtual machines in the same physical host. The probability that the external attacker successfully exploits the valid assets is theoretically analyzed. Simulation results show the attackers' success rate can be significantly reduced by adding decoy virtual machines. Simulation results also show that the greater the knowledge about the attackers' capability, the better protection the proposed approaches can provide.},

abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) is the key outcome of extensive research efforts over the past few decades toward transforming the Internet infrastructure to be more programmable, configurable, and manageable. However, critical cyber-threats in the SDN-based cloud environment are rising rapidly, in which distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one of the most damaging cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to tackle DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud environment. We first introduce a new hybrid machine learning model based on support vector machine and self-organizing map algorithms to improve the traffic classification. Then, we propose an enhanced history-based IP filtering scheme ($eHIPF$ ) to improve the attack detection rate and speed. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism that combines both the hybrid machine learning model and the $eHIPF$ scheme to make a DDoS attack defender for the SDN-based cloud environment. The testbed is implemented in an SDN-based cloud with service function chaining. Through practical experiments, the proposed DDoS attack defender is proven to outperform existing mechanisms for DDoS attack classification and detection. The comprehensive experiments conducted with various DDoS attack levels prove that the proposed mechanism is an effective, innovative approach to defend DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud.},

pages={2544-2552},
abstract={Comparing to well protected data frames, Wi-Fi management frames (MFs) are extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Since MFs are transmitted without encryption or authentication, attackers can easily launch various attacks by forging the MFs. In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method. We observe about 8 times improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking frames.},

abstract={Constructing adversarial examples in a black-box threat model injures the original images by introducing visual distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack approach that can directly minimize the induced distortion by learning the noise distribution of the adversarial example, assuming only loss-oracle access to the black-box network. To quantify visual distortion, the perceptual distance between the adversarial example and the original image, is introduced in our loss. We first approximate the gradient of the corresponding non-differentiable loss function by sampling noise from the learned noise distribution. Then the distribution is updated using the estimated gradient to reduce visual distortion. The learning continues until an adversarial example is found. We validate the effectiveness of our attack on ImageNet. Our attack results in much lower distortion when compared to the state-of-the-art black-box attacks and achieves 100% success rate on InceptionV3, ResNet50 and VGG16bn. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the convergence of our model. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alina-1997/visual-distortion-in-attack.},

abstract={A software defined networking (SDN)-enabled smart city is a new paradigm that can effectively improve the cost efficiency and flexibility of data management through data-control separation. However, it faces significant security threats such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which jeopardize the security and availability of data and services by overloading the system with excessive traffic from distributed sources. To improve the DDoS defense capability and enhance the security of data management in SDN-enabled smart cities, this paper proposes a DDoS attack Defense strategy based on Traffic Classification (DDTC). We use software defined network function virtualization (SDNFV) architecture and traffic classification strategy, to improve the flexibility and reduce the load of SDN against DDoS attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed DDTC can not only launch DDoS attacks detection quickly, but also accurately track the sources of DDoS attacks. More importantly, it can reduce the risk of attack on the controller of SDN and improve the effectiveness of the system.},

year={2019},

pages={69363-69378},
abstract={Android pattern lock is still popularly used for mobile user authentication. Unfortunately, however, many concerns have been raised regarding its security and usability. User-created patterns tend to be simply structured or reduced to a small set. Complex patterns are hard to memorize. Input patterns are susceptible to various attacks, such as guessing attacks, smudge attacks, and shoulder surfing attacks. This paper presents a novel mechanism based on the pattern lock, in which behavioral biometrics are employed to address these problems. Our basic idea starts from turning the lock pattern into public knowledge rather than a secret and leveraging touch dynamics. Users do not need to create their own lock patterns or memorize them. Instead, our system shows a public pattern along with guidance on how to draw it. All the user needs to do for authentication is to draw the pattern as shown. For adversaries, the above-mentioned attacks are rendered useless by this new mechanism. Specifically, we study how to generate the public patterns and how to perform authentication. We considered segments, angles, directions, and turns as units for constructing the lock patterns, and established the public pattern criteria. The results are utilized to generate four public patterns in our experiment. For authentication, we achieved equal error rates (EERs) as low as 2.66% (sitting), 3.53% (walking), and 5.83% (combined). Furthermore, the results of our additional experiments demonstrated that our system preserved performance over time (F1-score = 89.88%, SD = 4.60%), and was sufficiently secure against camera-based recording attacks (FAR = 3.25%).},

pages={582-597},
abstract={Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 1030. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we tested.},

abstract={Cloud computing is now known as the most cost-effective platform for delivering big data and artificial intelligence services over the Internet to enterprises and cloud consumers. However, despite many recent security developments, many cloud consumers continue to express great concern about using these platforms because they still have significant vulnerabilities. Typically, Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks exploit the pay-as-you-go billing mechanisms used by cloud service providers, so that a cloud customer is forced to pay an extra fee for the additional resources triggered by the attack activities. In our previous work, we already proposed an system to mitigate such EDoS attacks. Overall, this previous work presented an effective system for detecting abnormal events; however, the false-alarm rates still remain relatively high and detection rates are low, because abnormal events could be caused by the cloud customer. Furthermore, our previous work still consumes a large number of computing resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an enhanced scheme to detect and mitigate EDoS attacks efficiently and reliably. Our proposed scheme is composed of online and offline phases, implementing a gated recurrent unit, which not only can capture complex temporal dependence relations in the data, but also can reduce the vanishing gradient problems in time series. First, to reflect the normal patterns, our proposed scheme learns accurate representations of multivariate time series. Next, these representations are used to reconstruct input data. Finally, the reconstruction probabilities not only can be used to find anomalies, but also can provide interpretations. The proposed scheme also introduces a self-adjusting threshold to reduce error rates, whereas existing solutions normally use a hard threshold to analyze the anomalies, which causes increasing error rates. Our comprehensive analysis of the results shows outstanding performance compared to other solutions and our previous work.},

abstract={As a consequence of the numerous cyber attacks over the last decade, both the consideration and use of cyberspace has fundamentally changed, and will continue to evolve. Military forces all over the world have come to value the new role of cyberspace in warfare, building up cyber commands, and establishing new capabilities. Integral to such capabilities is that military forces fundamentally depend on the rapid exchange of information in order for their decision-making processes to gain superiority on the battlefield; this compounds the need to develop network- enabled capabilities to realize network-centric warfare. This triangle of cyber offense, cyber defence, and cyber dependence creates a challenging and complex system of interdependencies. Alongside, while numerous technologies have not improved cyber security significantly, this may change with upcoming new concepts and systems, like decentralized ledger technologies (Blockchains) or quantum-secured communication. Following these thoughts, the paper analyses the development of both cyber threats and defence capabilities during the past 10 years, evaluates the current situation and gives recommendations for improvements. To this end, the paper is structured as follows: first, general conditions for military forces with respect to "cyber" are described, including an analysis of the most likely courses of action of the West and their seemingly traditional adversary in the East, Russia. The overview includes a discussion of the usefulness of the measures and an overview of upcoming technologies critical for cyber security. Finally, requirements and recommendations for the further development of cyber defence are briefly covered.},

In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the social network graph topology and the achievable privacy. We observe three metrics, namely degree distribution, clustering coefficient and mixing time, and show that they give fundamental insights on the privacy degree of the OSN. We propose how to exploit these insight for the design of future privacy-friendly OSN.},

abstract={Home surveillance cameras have been widely used in recent years, however, what comes next is the increasing events of users' privacy disclosure. Most cameras use video compression technologies such as H.26X and MPEG to reduce the stream size during transmission on the purpose to transfer higher definition(HD) video with limited bandwidth. Although traffic is encrypted, these video differential encoding techniques can cause traffic patterns to change as users' behavior changes. Therefore, it is very meaningful to mine user privacy behavior hidden behind the surveillance traffic based on traffic statistical features. In this paper, we collected a large amount of surveillance video traffic, including 9 kinds of daily life behaviors, such as watching TV, switching door, sweeping the floor, etc. According to frequency distribution sequences of packet length, probability transition matrix of packet length and other statistical features, we used a variety of models to classify users' daily life behaviors. The results show that the random forest classifier and the AlexNet classifier can achieve a macro-averaging F1-score of 97.23% and 97.89% respectively. The performance of our approach reveals that the users' daily routine can be accurately constructed only through video traffic, which is a potentially huge security issue for the users.

abstract={One of the most important fields in discrete mathematics is graph theory. Graph theory is discrete structures, consisting of vertices and edges that connect these vertices. Problems in almost every conceivable discipline can be solved using graph models. The field graph theory started its journey from the problem of Konigsberg Bridges in 1735. This paper is a guide for the applied mathematician who would like to know more about network security, cryptography and cyber security based of graph theory. The paper gives a brief overview of the subject and the applications of graph theory in computer security, and provides pointers to key research and recent survey papers in the area.},

abstract={Conficker is the most recent widespread, well-known worm/bot. According to several reports, it has infected about 7 million to 15 million hosts and the victims are still increasing even now. In this paper, we analyze Conficker infections at a large scale, about 25 million victims, and study various interesting aspects about this state-of-the-art malware. By analyzing Conficker, we intend to understand current and new trends in malware propagation, which could be very helpful in predicting future malware trends and providing insights for future malware defense. We observe that Conficker has some very different victim distribution patterns compared to many previous generation worms/botnets, suggesting that new malware spreading models and defense strategies are likely needed. We measure the potential power of Conficker to estimate its effects on the networks/hosts when it performs malicious operations. Furthermore, we intend to determine how well a reputation-based blacklisting approach can perform when faced with new malware threats such as Conficker. We cross-check several DNS blacklists and IP/AS reputation data from Dshield and FIRE and our evaluation shows that unlike a previous study which shows that a blacklist-based approach can detect most bots, these reputation-based approaches did relatively poorly for Conficker. This raises a question of how we can improve and complement existing reputation-based techniques to prepare for future malware defense? Based on this, we look into some insights for defenders. We show that neighborhood watch is a surprisingly effective approach in the case of Conficker. This suggests that security alert sharing/correlation (particularly among neighborhood networks) could be a promising approach and play a more important role for future malware defense.},

abstract={Thanks to the popularity of mobile devices numerous location-based services (LBS) have emerged. While several privacy-preserving solutions for LBS have been proposed, most of these solutions do not consider the fact that LBS are typically cloud-based nowadays. Outsourcing data and computation to the cloud raises a number of significant challenges related to data confidentiality, user identity and query privacy, fine-grained access control, and query expressiveness. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for outsourcing LBS to the cloud. The framework supports multi-location queries with fine-grained access control, and search by location attributes, while providing semantic security. In particular, the framework implements a new model that allows the user to govern the trade-off between precision and privacy on a dynamic per-query basis. We also provide a security analysis to show that the proposed scheme preserves privacy in the presence of different threats. We also show the viability of our proposed solution and scalability with the number of locations through an experimental evaluation, using a real-life OpenStreetMap dataset.},

pages={2522-2537},
abstract={The ability of hackers to infiltrate computer systems using computer attack programs and bots led to the development of Captchas or Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. The text Captcha is the most popular Captcha scheme given its ease of construction and user friendliness. However, the next generation of hackers and programmers has decreased the expected security of these mechanisms, leaving websites open to attack. Text Captchas are still widely used, because it is believed that the attack speeds are slow, typically two to five seconds per image, and this is not seen as a critical threat. In this paper, we introduce a simple, generic, and fast attack on text Captchas that effectively challenges that supposition. With deep learning techniques, our attack demonstrates a high success rate in breaking the Roman-character-based text Captchas deployed by the top 50 most popular international websites and three Chinese Captchas that use a larger character set. These targeted schemes cover almost all existing resistance mechanisms, demonstrating that our attack techniques are also applicable to other existing Captchas. Does this work then spell the beginning of the end for text-based Captcha? We believe so. A novel image-based Captcha named Style Area Captcha (SACaptcha) is proposed in this paper, which is based on semantic information understanding, pixel-level segmentation, and deep learning techniques. Having demonstrated that text Captchas are no longer secure, we hope that our proposal shows promise in the development of image-based Captchas using deep learning techniques.},

To advance named entity recognition research in network security field, we introduce a large-scale Dataset for Named Entity Recognition in Threat Intelligence (DNRTI). To this end, we collect more than 300 pieces of threat intelligence. The data in DNRTI is all annotated by experts in threat intelligence interpretation using 13 object categories. The fully annotated DNRTI contains 175220 words. To build a baseline for named entity recognition in the threat intelligence field, we evaluate some deep learning model on DNRTI. Experiments demonstrate that DNRTI well represents the key information in threat intelligence and are quite challenging.},

The exercises follow a Red vs. Blue team format, in which the Red team conducts malicious activities against emulated networks and systems that have to be defended by Blue teams of learners. Although this exercise format is popular and used worldwide by numerous organizers in practice, it has been sparsely researched. We contribute to the topic by describing the general exercise life cycle, covering the exercise's development, dry run, execution, evaluation, and repetition. Each phase brings several challenges that exercise organizers have to deal with. We present lessons learned that can help organizers to prepare, run and repeat successful events systematically, with lower effort and costs, and avoid a trial-and-error approach that is often used.},

abstract={With the widespread growth in applications for resource limited Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), the need for reliable and efficient security mechanisms for them has increased manifold but its implementation is a non-trivial task. Limitations in processing speed, battery power, bandwidth and memory constrain the applicability of existing cryptography Algorithms for WSNs. Several security mechanisms, such as TinySec, have been introduced to address the need for security in WSNs. The cost of security, however, still mostly remains an unknown variable. To provide a better understanding of this cost we have studied three encryption algorithms, AES, RC5 and RC6. We have measured and compared their memory and energy consumption on Mica2 sensor motes. The results of our experiments provide insight into the suitability of different security algorithms for use in WSN environments and could be used by WSN designers to construct the security architecture of their systems in a way that both satisfies the requirements of the application and reasonably uses the constrained sensor resources.},

abstract={The ZigBee specification builds upon IEEE 802.15.4 low-rate wireless personal area standards by adding security and mesh networking functionality. ZigBee networks may be secured through 128-bit encryption keys and by MAC address access control lists, yet these credentials are vulnerable to interception and spoofing via free software tools available over the Internet. This work proposes a multi-factor PHY-MAC-NWK security framework for ZigBee that augments bit-level security using radio frequency (RF) PHY features. These features, or RF fingerprints, can be used to differentiate between dissimilar or like-model wireless devices. Previous PHY-based works on mesh network device differentiation predominantly exploited the signal turn-on region, measured in nanoseconds. For an arbitrary benchmark of 90% or better classification accuracy, this work shows that reliable PHY-based ZigBee device discrimination can be achieved at SNR ≥ 8 dB. This is done using the entire transmission preamble, which is less technically challenging to detect and is over 1000 times longer than the signal turn-on region. This work also introduces a statistical, pre-classification feature ranking technique for identifying relevant features that dramatically reduces the number of RF fingerprint features without sacrificing classification performance.},

abstract={Microservice Architectures (MSA) structure applications as a collection of loosely coupled services that implement business capabilities. The key advantages of MSA include inherent support for continuous deployment of large complex applications, agility and enhanced productivity. However, studies indicate that most MSA are homogeneous, and introduce shared vulnerabilites, thus vulnerable to multi-step attacks, which are economics-of-scale incentives to attackers. In this paper, we address the issue of shared vulnerabilities in microservices with a novel solution based on the concept of Moving Target Defenses (MTD). Our mechanism works by performing risk analysis against microservices to detect and prioritize vulnerabilities. Thereafter, security risk-oriented software diversification is employed, guided by a defined diversification index. The diversification is performed at runtime, leveraging both model and template based automatic code generation techniques to automatically transform programming languages and container images of the microservices. Consequently, the microservices attack surfaces are altered thereby introducing uncertainty for attackers while reducing the attackability of the microservices. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our solution, with an average success rate of over 70% attack surface randomization.},

abstract={The long-term evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced (LTE-A) network provides advanced services for billions of users with its higher bandwidths, better spectrum efficiency, and lower latency than legacy cellular networks. But it still suffers from new security threats due to its all IP-based heterogeneous architecture. Therefore, there is a critical need to perform a rapid and accurate network security measurement in the LTE/LTE-A network. To achieve LTE/LTE-A network security measurement, security-relevant data (in short security data) collection and data analysis for attack detection are required as prerequisites. However, most of the existing work only focuses on data collection and analysis for a certain type of LTE/LTE-A attacks. Little work has been done to comprehensively perform data collection and analysis for detecting various attacks on the LTE/LTE-A network. Different from previous work, in this paper, we review the security data collection and data analysis methods in terms of various attacks in order to provide the basis of security measurement in the LTE/LTE-A network. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks according to the LTE/LTE-A network structure. Then, we propose a number of criteria for evaluating the performance of data collection and analysis methods. And we lay our emphasis on the survey of data collection and analysis methods for significant active attack detection in the LTE/LTE-A network. All the reviewed methods are analyzed and discussed based on the proposed evaluation criteria. Furthermore, current open issues and future research challenges are presented with a view to stimulating future research. Finally, an adaptive data collection and data analysis model for security measurement in the LTE/LTE-A network is proposed.},

abstract={This paper presents an overview of device identification techniques and the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) standard used for the Internet of things to reduce the IoT attack surface. The ongoing diversity and the sheer increase in the number of connected IoT devices have crumpled security efforts. There is a need to reconsider and redesign the underlying concept of developing security systems to resolve IoT security challenges. In this backdrop, device profiling and identification have emerged as an exciting technique that helps to reduce IoT device attack surface. One of the known approaches for device identification is to fingerprint a device. There are many ways to fingerprint the device, mostly using device network flows or device local attributes. The device identification ensures the authenticity of the device attached to the network, like user authentication. Since IoT devices mostly work using machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, this requires identifying each device properly. But there is no unified approach for device identification for the ever-growing world of IoT devices and applications. One of the major steps forward in this direction is the development of the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) standard that defines the role of a device within the network. It limits the device to execute the primary task only, which will help to reduce the attack surface. Since the inception of MUD, many security frameworks use this standard for IoT security. However, there is a need to scrutinize the security frameworks based on the MUD, to find out the claimed effectiveness of the standard in IoT security. This paper initially identifies and classifies the potential vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Then, the study provides an overview of the research that focuses on device identification techniques and analyzes their role in IoT security. Finally, the research presents an overview of MUD technology, its implementation scenarios, the limitation of the latest MUD standard, and its applications in the industry. The prime aim of this work is to examine the MUD benefits in IoT security along with the weaknesses and challenges while implementing this standard along with future directions.},

abstract={As the convenience and cost benefits of natural user interface (NUI) technologies are hastening their wide adoption, computing devices equipped with such interfaces are becoming ubiquitous. Used for a broad range of applications, from accessing email and bank accounts to home automation and interacting with a healthcare provider, such devices require, more than ever before, a secure yet convenient user authentication mechanism. This paper introduces a new taxonomy and presents a survey of “point-of-entry” user-device authentication mechanisms that employ a natural user interaction. The taxonomy allows a grouping of the surveyed techniques based on the sensor type used to capture user input, the actuator a user applies during interaction, and the credential type used for authentication. A set of security and usability evaluation criteria are then proposed based on the Bonneau, Herley, Van Oorschot, and Stajano framework. An analysis of a selection of techniques and, more importantly, the broader taxonomy elements they belong to, based on these evaluation criteria, are provided. This analysis and taxonomy provide a framework for the comparison of different authentication alternatives given an application and a targeted threat model. Similarly, the taxonomy and analysis also offer insights into possibly unexplored, yet potentially rewarding, research avenues for NUI-based user authentication that could be explored.},

abstract={Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in social network analysis. A common set of techniques for link prediction rely on similarity metrics which use the topology of the observed subnetwork to quantify the likelihood of unobserved links. Recently, similarity metrics for link prediction have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks whereby observations about the network are adversarially modified to hide target links. We propose a novel approach for increasing robustness of similarity-based link prediction by endowing the analyst with a restricted set of reliable queries which accurately measure the existence of queried links. The analyst aims to robustly predict a collection of possible links by optimally allocating the reliable queries. We formalize the analyst's problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game in which they first choose the reliable queries, followed by an adversary who deletes a subset of links among the remaining (unreliable) queries by the analyst. The analyst in our model is uncertain about the particular target link the adversary attempts to hide, whereas the adversary has full information about the analyst and the network. Focusing on similarity metrics using only local information, we show that the problem is NP-Hard for both players, and devise two principled and efficient approaches for solving it approximately. Extensive experiments with real and synthetic networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract={The mobile ecosystem on top of the telephone networks and the Internet is a dominant computing paradigm and the most growing and rapidly changing technology nowadays. Many works regarding its security and trustworthiness aspects have been conducted, and many specific solutions have been proposed. Recently, as a reaction to surveillance, smartphone systems providers have included encryption on the phones. This action immediately triggered government law enforcement agencies to criticize it. This is reminiscent of the 90's cryptowars as the Internet became popular. It is therefore expected that a policy debate and policy decision making process is to take place for a while now. To engage in a policy debate it is important to understand the role of encryption availability at the hands of the smartphone user, and understand its bright side (advantages) and dark side (threats), and compare the two. Without evaluating the advantages of encryption on the phone, the policy debate will miss important components (and may be then reduced to a “shouting match” between opposing teams). This work is a step in this direction, elaborating on the bright side. The methodology we employ involves surveying a wide range of security concerns and possible readily available existing solutions to them, and a differential analysis of what can be done with cryptography on the phone vs. what can be done without it. This cumulative advantage is the positive value of encryption at the hands of the smartphone user. We hope this work will encourage further investigations of this nature using this methodology (we do not claim to be fully exhaustive and have all analysis components right), since we believe this debate is possibly crucial stage in the mobile phone evolution.},

One of the most popular and serious attack in wireless sensor network is the wormhole attack. It is an especially severe attack on routing protocols for specially appointed systems in which two or additionally colluding attackers record packets at one location, and tunnel them to another location for a replay at that remote location. When this attack targets routing control packets, the nodes that are near the attackers are guarded from any option route with more than maybe a couple bounces to the remote area. All routes are along these lines coordinated to the wormhole set up by the attackers. In this work paper make the literature review of detection and prevention of black hole and wormhole attack. Also proposed the trust based mechanism for detection of wormhole attack that is already simulated for black hole attack. Simulation results are used with the NS-2 simulator and attack has been evaluated in term of packet delivery ratio, throughput, delay and routing overhead compare to a network without or with attack. And results shows that performance will be increase.},

abstract={Cyber-security is the practice of protecting computing systems and networks from digital attacks, which are a rising concern in the Information Age. With the growing pace at which new attacks are developed, conventional signature based attack detection methods are often not enough, and machine learning poses as a potential solution. Adversarial machine learning is a research area that examines both the generation and detection of adversarial examples, which are inputs specially crafted to deceive classifiers, and has been extensively studied specifically in the area of image recognition, where minor modifications are performed on images that cause a classifier to produce incorrect predictions. However, in other fields, such as intrusion and malware detection, the exploration of such methods is still growing. The aim of this survey is to explore works that apply adversarial machine learning concepts to intrusion and malware detection scenarios. We concluded that a wide variety of attacks were tested and proven effective in malware and intrusion detection, although their practicality was not tested in intrusion scenarios. Adversarial defenses were substantially less explored, although their effectiveness was also proven at resisting adversarial attacks. We also concluded that, contrarily to malware scenarios, the variety of datasets in intrusion scenarios is still very small, with the most used dataset being greatly outdated.},

abstract={We are focusing on a new and yet uncovered way for malicious apps to gain profit. They claim to be dating apps. However, their sole purpose is to lure users into purchasing premium/VIP services to start conversations with other (likely fake female) accounts in the app. We call these apps as fraudulent dating apps. This paper performs a systematic study to understand the whole ecosystem of fraudulent dating apps. Specifically, we have proposed a three-phase method to detect them and subsequently comprehend their characteristics via analyzing the existing account profiles. Our observation reveals that most of the accounts are not managed by real persons, but by chatbots based on predefined conversation templates. We also analyze the business model of these apps and reveal that multiple parties are actually involved in the ecosystem, including producers who develop apps, publishers who publish apps to gain profit, and the distribution network that is responsible for distributing apps to end users. Finally, we analyze the impact of them to users (i.e., victims) and estimate the overall revenue. Our work is the first systematic study on fraudulent dating apps, and the results demonstrate the urge for a solution to protect users.},

abstract={The security issue impacting the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has recently attracted significant attention from the research community. To this end, several surveys were put forward addressing various IoT-centric topics, including intrusion detection systems, threat modeling, and emerging technologies. In contrast, in this paper, we exclusively focus on the ever-evolving IoT vulnerabilities. In this context, we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys, which address various dimensions of the IoT paradigm. This aims at facilitating IoT research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light on IoT vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives, attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective related to IoT vulnerabilities, including their technical details and consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally, motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the IoT paradigm, this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale IoT exploitations by drawing upon more than 1.2 GB of macroscopic, passive measurements' data. This aims at practically highlighting the severity of the IoT problem, while providing operational situational awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large. Insightful findings, inferences and outcomes in addition to open challenges and research problems are also disclosed in this paper, which we hope would pave the way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related to the imperative topic of IoT security.},

This paper shares post-graduate research that utilised Attack Tree Analysis, Soft Systems Thinking and Red Teaming techniques to contextualise the cybersecurity risks to this paradigm.

abstract={Various attacks may disclose sensitive information such as passwords of mobile devices. Residue-based attacks exploit oily or heat residues on the touch screen, computer vision based attacks analyze the hand movement on a keyboard, and sensor based attacks measure a device's motion difference via motion sensors as different keys are tapped. A randomized soft keyboard may defeat these attacks. However, a randomized key layout is counter-intuitive and users may be reluctant to adopt it. In this paper, we introduce a novel and intuitive input system, secure finger mouse, which uses a mobile device's camera sensing the fingertip movement, moves an on-screen cursor and performs clicks by sensing click gestures. We design a randomized mouse acceleration algorithm so that the adversary cannot infer keys clicked on the soft keyboard by observing the finger movement. The secure finger mouse can defeat attacks including residue, computer vision and motion based attacks too. We perform both theoretical analysis and real-world experiments to demonstrate the security and usability of the secure fingertip mouse.},

abstract={In recent years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become valuable assets to both the commercial and military communities with applications ranging from industrial control on a factory floor to reconnaissance of a hostile border. A typical WSN topology that applies to most applications allows sensors to act as data sources that forward their measurements to a central sink or base station (BS). The unique role of the BS makes it a natural target for an adversary that desires to achieve the most impactful attack possible against a WSN. An adversary may employ traffic analysis techniques such as evidence theory to identify the BS based on network traffic flow even when the WSN implements conventional security mechanisms. This motivates a need for WSN operators to achieve improved BS anonymity to protect the identity, role, and location of the BS. Location anonymity assessments depend on an adversary's ability to achieve accurate range estimates to map intercepted traffic to the target network's topology. These range estimates may suffer from a variety of errors depending on the specific RF propagation environment in which the target system operates. BS anonymity estimates in turn may be degraded depending on the severity of the ranging errors. In this paper we examine the effect of Gaussian distributed ranging errors on BS anonymity using evidence theory analysis and simulation.},

pages={288-306},
abstract={Governments around the world are demanding more access to encrypted data, but it has been difficult to build a system that allows the authorities some access without providing unlimited access in practice. In this paper, we present new techniques for maximizing user privacy in jurisdictions that require support for so-called “exceptional access” to encrypted data. In contrast to previous work on this topic (e.g., key escrow), our approach places most of the responsibility for achieving exceptional access on the government, rather than on the users or developers of cryptographic tools. As a result, our constructions are very simple and lightweight, and they can be easily retrofitted onto existing applications and protocols. Critically, we introduce no new third parties, and we add no new messages beyond a single new Diffie-Hellman key exchange in protocols that already use Diffie-Hellman. We present two constructions for crumpling cryptographic keys to make it possible-although arbitrarily expensive-for a government to recover the plaintext for targeted messages. Our symmetric crumpling technique uses a hash-based proof of work to impose a linear cost on the adversary for each message she wishes to recover. Additionally, our public-key crumpling method uses a novel application of Diffie-Hellman over modular arithmetic groups to create an extremely expensive puzzle that the adversary must solve before she can recover even a single message. Our initial analysis shows that we can impose an upfront cost in the range of $100M to several billion dollars and a linear cost between $1K-$1M per message. We show how our constructions can easily be adapted to common tools including PGP, Signal, SRTP, full-disk encryption, and file-based encryption.},

abstract={Cyber attacks are currently blooming, as the attackers reap significant profits from them and face a limited risk when compared to committing the “classical” crimes. One of the major components that leads to the successful compromising of the targeted system is malicious software. It allows using the victim's machine for various nefarious purposes, e.g., making it a part of the botnet, mining cryptocurrencies, or holding hostage the data stored there. At present, the complexity, proliferation, and variety of malware pose a real challenge for the existing countermeasures and require their constant improvements. That is why, in this paper we first perform a detailed meta-review of the existing surveys related to malware and its detection techniques, showing an arms race between these two sides of a barricade. On this basis, we review the evolution of modern threats in the communication networks, with a particular focus on the techniques employing information hiding. Next, we present the bird's eye view portraying the main development trends in detection methods with a special emphasis on the machine learning techniques. The survey is concluded with the description of potential future research directions in the field of malware detection.},

abstract={Voice assistant devices function as interaction gateways in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) smart home. By using voice assistants, users are able to control smart homes via speech commands. However, voice assistants introduce potential security risks and privacy disclosures. For example, malicious actors could impersonate genuine users to send smart home speech commands. Speaker/user verification thus becomes a critical issue for smart home security. This article proposes a secure method for speaker verification in IoT smart homes using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. Specifically, we utilize the radar to capture both vocal cord vibration (VCV) and lip motion (LM) as multimodal biometrics for identifying speakers. Traditional voice-based speaker verification methods are vulnerable to impostor attacks, such as replay attacks and voice synthesis attacks, that use recorded or imitated voice audio to spoof the system. Our approach is able to protect IoT smart homes from these attacks by continuously detecting the liveness of the user using mmWave sensing and deep learning techniques. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve high verification accuracy and be more robust against imposter attacks.},

abstract={In 3GPP LTE, the physical layer is divided into data and signaling, where the signaling (or control information) enables efficient data exchange/resource scheduling. The LTE uplink contains a physical channel known as the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH), which carries uplink control information such as message acknowledgements, scheduling requests, and channel status information from user equipment (UE) to LTE base stations (eNodeB). The PUCCH is located on the edges of the system bandwidth in a static location. The static allocation of the PUCCH presents a dilemma: an adversary can disrupt the uplink channel with minimal effort and only needs to know the PUCCH's spectrum allocation. In this paper we (i) take a closer look at the purpose and specification of the PUCCH, (ii) we propose various strategies to be used for the detection of interference specifically on the PUCCH, and (iii) we outline strategies for mitigating 'protocol-aware' interference on the PUCCH. Some of the mitigation strategies, such as control information duplication, can be implemented with minimal changes to LTE eNodeBs and UEs, while other countermeasures require augmentations to both eNodeB and UE hardware or software.},

pages={1361-1375},
abstract={When remote command injection attacks succeed at the entry points of a cloud (servers exposed to the outside Internet), attackers targeting a specific asset in the cloud will pursue further exploration to find their targets. Attack targets, such as database servers, are often running on separate machines, forcing an extra step for a successful attack. However, compromising two or three machines is all an attacker needs to reach an isolated database through a simple attack path. The goal of this paper is to investigate the possibility of frustrating attackers by constructing a cloud network architecture that hides the path to a target asset in the network, utilizing multiple moving decoy virtual machines and confusing firewall configurations. A deceiving cloud network architecture can significantly delay attacks (by stretching the attack path from a handful of steps to thousands), providing time for system administrators to intervene and resolve the intrusion. This paper introduces the concept of misery digraphs, which provide a theoretical foundation for creating intrusion deception in clouds. This paper describes the necessary steps to convert a cloud to one that includes a misery digraph, and evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of using the approach with Amazon Web Services. Our simulation results demonstrate that for a cloud implementing misery digraphs with a simple attack path of length five, there is a 91% probability that an attack requires at least 1000 steps to reach the target.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) providers serve better IoT services each year while producing more IoT gateways and devices to expand their services. However, the security of the IoT ecosystem remains an afterthought for most IoT providers. This action results in many cybersecurity breaches in the field, most likely due to the lack of access control mechanisms. In this paper, we propose BorderChain, an access control framework based on blockchain for IoT endpoints. The security protocol guarantees two properties. First, our proposal assures IoT users and services that they communicate with approved IoT gateways as endpoints, holding verified IoT devices that they need. Second, BorderChain also generates access tokens that the IoT service and users can use to query IoT resources legitimately inside the IoT domains. As a result, the protocol can convince IoT domain owners that the system will only authorize IoT requests that they approve. We realize our protocol in the form of a smart contract to allow many IoT entities such as IoT domain owners, IoT devices, IoT gateways, IoT vendors, IoT services, IoT users, and Internet Service Provider (ISP) to collaborate in a unified environment. We then implement entities in BorderChain as Node JS applications connecting to the Ethereum blockchain as our peer-to-peer platform.

abstract={Opportunistic Networks is a new concept that is increasingly gaining ground since it appears as a concrete example of the Internet of Things, Internet of Vehicles, Industrial Internet of Things, and the Internet of Everything with Mobile ad hoc Networks’ characteristics. An Opportunistic Network starts with a Seed OppNet that sets up the network; expands from the Seed OppNet to an extended Seed OppNet through devices’ discovery. The characteristics of Opportunistic Networks make OppNets more challenging than any other networks. So, a deep understanding of OppNets’ characteristics and demands is an unavoidable precondition before proposing any OppNets related scheme. However, under OppNets’ constraints, the relevance of the Opportunistic Networks related articles in literature is yet to be established. Also, most surveys tackling Opportunistic Networks do not give a complete insight into what Opportunistic Networks stand for. This work reviews state of the art on Opportunistic Networks providing three main contributions. First, resorting to the primary definition of Opportunistic Networks, it elucidates what OppNets are, pointing out the particularities of an OppNet, its domains of applications, and challenges. Second, it provides a comprehensive review that encompasses most Opportunistic Networks’ research areas: routing, intrusion detection, authentication, privacy protection, data aggregation, and the technology for OppNets, organising them in a taxonomy. Third, it evaluates the role of the Seed OppNet in Opportunistic Networks related schemes. Any proposed OppNets related scheme, to be relevant to OppNets’ research, should include OppNets’ characteristics and demands.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices have connected millions of houses around the globe via the internet. In the recent past, threats due to hardware Trojan (HT) in the integrated circuits (IC) have become a serious concern, which affects IoT edge devices (IoT-ED). In this paper, the possibility of the IoT-ED with embedded HT that can cause serious security, privacy, and availability problems to the IoT based Home Area Network (HAN) has been discussed. Conventional network attack detection techniques work at the network protocol layers, whereas IoT-ED with HT can lead to the peculiar manifestation of attack at the physical and/or firmware level. On the other hand, in the IC design, most of the HT-based attack detection techniques require design time intervention, which is expensive for many of the IoT-ED and cannot guarantee 100% immunity. The argument in this paper is that the health of modern IoT-ED requires a final line of defense against possible HT-based attacks that goes undetected during IC design and test. The approach is to utilize power profiling (PP) and network traffic (NT) data without intervening into the IC design to detect malicious activity in HAN. The proposed technique is to effectively identify multiple attacks concurrently and to differentiate between different types of attacks. The IoT-ED behaviors for five different types of random attacks have been studied, including covert channel, DoS, ARQ, power depletion, and impersonation attacks. Data fusion has been leveraged by combining the PP and NT data and is able to detect, without design time intervention, each of the five attacks individually with up to 99% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed technique can also detect all the attacks concurrently with 92% accuracy. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work where multiple HT based attacks are concurrently detected in IoT-ED without requiring any design time intervention.},

abstract={This article presents a new and efficient method based on power analysis, hierarchical recognition of instructions, and machine learning for reverse engineering of the instructions of PIC16F690 as an 8-bit microcontroller and LPC1768, which includes an ARM Cortex-M3 core as a 32-bit platform. Both dynamic and static power consumption were considered and analyzed. The instructions were classified in different Hamming weight groups using ensemble classification algorithms along with the Kullback-Leibler feature selection method to improve the recognition rate of opcodes and operands of real instructions. Results demonstrated 99.5% and 93.3% average success rate in recovering test instructions and real codes of PIC16F690, respectively. This work also presents promising results in reverse engineering of the instructions of LPC1768 with an overall recognition rate of 98% for test codes and 80.2% for real codes.

abstract={Smart city progress from classical homogenous technologies with limited facility to heterogeneous interconnected network with immense capabilities. Furthermore, there is a good concern in expanding the scope of application in the smart city. The primary objective of the smart city is to achieve optimization and reinforce the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications by cleverer usage of urban resources. The QoS in the network is measured using several factors like end-end delay, energy consumption, packet loss and throughput. Several pitfalls are experienced in the existing routing innovation. In this proposal, a new technology-based routing structure is proposed. Road Side Units (RSU) will allow the planners to deploy the application without unfamiliar tools for data process and gathering. Data forwarding, acquisition and diffusion are simplified by RSU. K-Nearest Neighbor is used for finding the nearest neighbor nodes and it is optimized using Whale optimization Algorithm (WOA). The evaluation outcomes prove that the intended routing plot provides much spectacle than existing protocols for real time applications.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are resource-constrained devices with limitations such as low computation power, low communication capabilities, low bandwidths, high latency, and short-lived power. Therefore, securing communication among these devices is a key challenge for various sensitive applications. However, the conventional encryption and decryption algorithms, known as ciphers, cannot be implemented because of their inherent complexities of implementation and power requirements. One of the promising options available is to implement light-weight ciphers for these resource-constrained devices. Moreover, the choice of lightweight encryption tool has a great dependency on the type of IoT devices being used in an application. In this paper, a lightweight cellular automata (CA)-based cipher, named as Lightweight CA Cipher (LCC), has been proposed for IoT applications. In the proposed method, encryption is done at the perception layer, where the sensor nodes are deployed and decryption is done at the network layer where gateway devices are installed. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient than some of the existing ciphers like DES, 3DES when randomness, execution time, and implementation simplicity are considered as prime requirements. This cipher passes the randomness tests as prescribed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and it also passes all the DIEHARD tests and it establishes the security feature of LCC. Though it is specially designed for resource-constrained environments, it can be scaled up for a large number of sensor nodes.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is considered as a collection of heterogeneous devices, such as sensors, Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and actuators, which form a huge network, enabling non-internet components in the network to produce a better world of services, like smart home, smart city, smart transportation, and smart industries. On the other hand, security and privacy are the most important aspects of the IoT network, which includes authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, and access control. Additionally, traditional network security cannot be directly used in IoT networks due to its limitations on computational capabilities and storage capacities. Furthermore, authentication is the mainstay of the IoT network, as all components undergo an authentication process before establishing communication. Therefore, securing authentication is essential. In this paper, we have focused on IoT security particularly on their authentication mechanisms. Consequently, we highlighted enormous attacks and technical methods on the IoT authentication mechanism. Additionally, we discussed existing security verification techniques and evaluation schemes of IoT authentication. Furthermore, analysis against current existing protocols have been discussed in all parts and provided some recommendation. Finally, the aim of our study is to help the future researcher by providing security issues, open challenges and future scopes in IoT authentication.},

abstract={Determining indoor location using image based methods has the promise to be fast and intuitive. Nonetheless, a practical implementation needs to operate without knowledge of true camera pose and focal length, and be discriminating enough to identify location from multiple indoor locations that appear similar.In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient method based on matching established planes in an environment to a query images. This greatly reduces the necessary computation, and improves accuracy by enforcing geometry on local feature descriptors. Accuracy is further improved by computing matching score based on number of matching pixels rather than descriptors as commonly done. Using a database of over 2000 planes and over 120 query images, we show our algorithm maintains accuracy over 86% even for challenging environments with multiple similar locations, and outperforms a feature based method by 10 - 40%.},

abstract={Email is one of the most expedient approach to transfer messages among people all over the world. Its features, specifically reliability, quickness, and low cost makes it popular and useful among people in most parts of businesses and society. On the other hand, this popularity also created new harmful actions, such as email attacks (spam) in cyberspace. Spam is arguably one of the main reasons of drowning the WWW with many copies of similar messages generated through anonymous senders, which yields to time/space wasting of the email account holder and also a large virus and malware threat to Email providers. In spite of employing various filters to handle spam problem such as machine learning and content-based filtering, spammers are still able to bypass these defense mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the use of string matching algorithms for spam email detection. Particularly this work examines and compares the efficiency of six well-known string matching algorithms, namely Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Levenshtein Distance (LD), Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, Bi-gram, and TFIDF on two various datasets which are Enron corpus and CSDMC2010 spam dataset. We observed that Bi-gram algorithm performs best in spam detection in both datasets.},

However, these works assumed a constant approach for selecting the images to be morphed (pairing) across their training and testing data. A realistic variation in the pairing protocol in the training data can result in challenges and opportunities for a stable attack detector. This work extensively study this issue by building a novel database with three different pairing protocols and two different morphing approaches. We study the detection generalization over these variations for single image and differential attack detection, along with handcrafted and CNN-based features. Our observations included that training an attack detection solution on attacks created from dissimilar face images, in contrary to the common practice, can result in an overall more generalized detection performance. Moreover, we found that differential attack detection is very sensitive to variations in morphing and pairing protocols.},

abstract={Social engineering has posed a serious security threat to infrastructure, user, data and operations of cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are many conceptual deficiencies (such as inconsistent conceptual intensions, a vague conceptual boundary, confusing instances, overgeneralization and abuse) of the term making serious negative impacts on the understanding, analysis and defense of social engineering attacks. In this paper, an in-depth literature survey is conducted, the original meaning of social engineering in cybersecurity is traced, the conceptual evolution and technical development are analysed systematically, and the conceptual problems are discussed. Based on above work, this paper attempts to address these conceptual deficiencies by proposing a more compatible and precise definition of social engineering in cybersecurity (SEiCS). This definition eliminates the conceptual inconsistencies, covers the mainstream conceptual connotations, clarifies the conceptual boundary, mitigates the overgeneralization and abuse, etc. Five analysis tables (i.e., the comparative analysis of the SEiCS definition vs. mainstream conceptual intensions in the conceptual evolution, the comparative analysis of the SEiCS definition vs. typical definitions in the literature, the analysis of confusing “social engineering cases”, the analysis of popular social engineering attack scenarios, and the analysis of social-engineering-based attacks) are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed definition.},

These challenges, which are not addressed adequately in the related literature, are investigated in this paper. Accordingly, practical solutions to mitigate such attacks are also proposed. Discussed challenges are clarified by means of conducting extensive experiments on an actual cloud data center testbed. Moreover, mitigation schemes have been implemented and examined in details.

pages={1790-1803},
abstract={Database-driven Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is the de-facto technical paradigm adopted by Federal Communications Commission for increasing spectrum efficiency, which allows licensed spectrum to be opportunistically used by secondary users. In database-driven DSS, a geo-location database administrator (DBA) maintains spectrum availability information over its service region in the form of a Radio Environment Map (REM), where the received signal strength from the primary user at every location is either directly measured via spectrum sensing or estimated via statistical spatial interpolation. Crowdsourcing-based spectrum sensing is a promising approach for periodically collecting spectrum measurements over a large geographic area but is unfortunately vulnerable to false spectrum measurements. Despite a large body of prior work on secure cooperative spectrum sensing, how to construct an accurate REM in the presence of false measurements remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce ST-REM, a novel spatiotemporal approach for securely constructing an REM in the presence of false spectrum measurements. Inspired by the self-label techniques developed for semi-supervised learning, ST-REM iteratively constructs an REM from a small number of spectrum measurements from trusted anchor sensors and many more measurements from mobile users. During each iteration, the DBA evaluates the trustworthiness of each measurement by jointly considering its spatial fitness with other trusted measurements and the mobile user's long-term behavior. By gradually incorporating the most trustworthy spectrum measurements, the DBA is able to construct a REM with high accuracy. Extensive simulation studies using a real spectrum measurement dataset confirm the efficacy and efficiency of ST-REM.},

abstract={This review summarises the status of silent speech interface (SSI) research. SSIs rely on non-acoustic biosignals generated by the human body during speech production to enable communication whenever normal verbal communication is not possible or not desirable. In this review, we focus on the first case and present latest SSI research aimed at providing new alternative and augmentative communication methods for persons with severe speech disorders. SSIs can employ a variety of biosignals to enable silent communication, such as electrophysiological recordings of neural activity, electromyographic (EMG) recordings of vocal tract movements or the direct tracking of articulator movements using imaging techniques. Depending on the disorder, some sensing techniques may be better suited than others to capture speech-related information. For instance, EMG and imaging techniques are well suited for laryngectomised patients, whose vocal tract remains almost intact but are unable to speak after the removal of the vocal folds, but fail for severely paralysed individuals. From the biosignals, SSIs decode the intended message, using automatic speech recognition or speech synthesis algorithms. Despite considerable advances in recent years, most present-day SSIs have only been validated in laboratory settings for healthy users. Thus, as discussed in this paper, a number of challenges remain to be addressed in future research before SSIs can be promoted to real-world applications. If these issues can be addressed successfully, future SSIs will improve the lives of persons with severe speech impairments by restoring their communication capabilities.},

abstract={With an enormous range of applications, the Internet of Things (IoT) has magnetized industries and academicians from everywhere. IoT facilitates operations through ubiquitous connectivity by providing Internet access to all the devices with computing capabilities. With the evolution of wireless infrastructure, the focus from simple IoT has been shifted to smart, connected and mobile IoT (M-IoT) devices and platforms, which can enable low-complexity, low-cost and efficient computing through sensors, machines, and even crowdsourcing. All these devices can be grouped under a common term of M-IoT. Even though the positive impact on applications has been tremendous, security, privacy and trust are still the major concerns for such networks and insufficient enforcement of these requirements introduces non-negligible threats to M-IoT devices and platforms. Thus, it is important to understand the range of solutions which are available for providing a secure, privacy-compliant, and trustworthy mechanism for M-IoT. There is no direct survey available, which focuses on security, privacy, trust, secure protocols, physical layer security and handover protections in M-IoT. This paper covers such requisites and presents comparisons of state-the-art solutions for IoT which are applicable to security, privacy, and trust in smart and connected M-IoT networks. Apart from these, various challenges, applications, advantages, technologies, standards, open issues, and roadmap for security, privacy and trust are also discussed in this paper.},

abstract={Radiolocation within indoor environments is a challenge due to the dynamic variations caused by movement of objects and the complex multipath radio propagation. Therefore techniques that are suitable for indoor scenarios need to be robust to the multipath effects, which leads to additional power consumption and complexity. For instance, Ultra-wideband transmission can overcome multipath impact at the expense of requiring at least three access points in range with high bandwidth transmission. Such approaches are not feasible in commodity and low power IoT device tracking using legacy transmitter devices, such as WiFi or Bluetooth. Therefore, the proposed approach to address this problem is to selectively use Angle of Arrival (AoA) capabilities in access points, with the need for only two, to adaptively take measurements as compatible devices move around the environment in order to update radio maps used for optimising this process. In doing so important inferences about the dynamic environment can be exploited to adapt the measurement intervals to reduce the measurements and processing required and conserve power.},

abstract={Increased peripheral performance is causing strain on the memory subsystem of modern processors. For example, available DRAM throughput can no longer sustain the traffic of a modern network card. Scrambling to deliver the promised performance, instead of transferring peripheral data to and from DRAM, modern Intel processors perform I/O operations directly on the Last Level Cache (LLC). While Direct Cache Access (DCA) instead of Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a sensible performance optimization, it is unfortunately implemented without care for security, as the LLC is now shared between the CPU and all the attached devices, including the network card.In this paper, we reverse engineer the behavior of DCA, widely referred to as Data-Direct I/O (DDIO), on recent Intel processors and present its first security analysis. Based on our analysis, we present NetCAT, the first Network-based PRIME+PROBE Cache Attack on the processor's LLC of a remote machine. We show that NetCAT not only enables attacks in cooperative settings where an attacker can build a covert channel between a network client and a sandboxed server process (without network), but more worryingly, in general adversarial settings. In such settings, NetCAT can enable disclosure of network timing-based sensitive information. As an example, we show a keystroke timing attack on a victim SSH connection belonging to another client on the target server. Our results should caution processor vendors against unsupervised sharing of (additional) microarchitectural components with peripherals exposed to malicious input.},

abstract={In this paper, we examine the use of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for a variant of one of the most popular and profitable games in the world: the card game Magic: The Gathering (M:TG). The game tree for M:TG has a range of distinctive features, which we discuss here; it has incomplete information through the opponent's hidden cards and randomness through card drawing from a shuffled deck. We investigate a wide range of approaches that use determinization, where all hidden and random information is assumed known to all players, alongside MCTS. We consider a number of variations to the rollout strategy using a range of levels of sophistication and expert knowledge, and decaying reward to encourage play urgency. We examine the effect of utilizing various pruning strategies in order to increase the information gained from each determinization, alongside methods that increase the relevance of random choices. Additionally, we deconstruct the move generation procedure into a binary yes/no decision tree and apply MCTS to this finer grained decision process. We compare our modifications to a basic MCTS approach for M:TG using fixed decks, and show that significant improvements in playing strength can be obtained.},

abstract={Mobile ad-hoc networks are a new field in networking because it works as an autonomous network. Application of mobile ad-hoc networks are increasing day by day in recent year now a days. So it important is increasing to provide suitable routing protocol and security from attacker. Mobile ad-hoc network now a days faces many problems such as small bandwidth, energy, security, limited computational and high mobility. The main problem in mobile ad-hoc networks is that wireless networks, Infrastructure wireless networks have larger bandwidth, larger memory, power backup and different routing protocol easily applies. But in case of mobile ad-hoc networks some of these application failed due to mobility and small power backup so it is required such type of routing protocol which is take small energy during the transfer of packet. So we see that still there are many challenging works in mobile ad-hoc networks remained and to research in this area related to routing protocol, security issues, solving energy problem and many more which is feasible to it. Our research most probably will be dedicated to Authentication in mobile ad-hoc network.},

We show that (a) the number of non-compute devices dominates the number of compute devices with open ports in a campus network; (b) 58.9% or more devices do not keep up-to-date firmware and 51.3% or more do not have a user defined password; and (c) the number of devices together with the diversity of device ages and vendors make the protection of IoT devices a difficult problem.

abstract={For large-scale data transmission of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), aggregate signature is an effective approach. It can compress the signatures of different senders to save bandwidth. In order to maintain the autonomous management of IIoT, massive sensing data are sent to the data center for intelligent analysis. The reliability of data is an important guarantee of the autonomous management of IIoT. Tracing abnormal senders is a challenge when hiding their real identity. Therefore, we design the first permissioned blockchain-based anonymous and traceable aggregate signature (PBATAS) scheme for IIoT. Smart contracts are used to authenticate anonymous sources and share cryptographic materials among entities, providing reliable regulatory support for IIoT. The regulator can quickly trace the abnormal data sources recorded on the blockchain, which is practical for the anonymous IIoT environment. Through the formal security proof of conditional anonymity, unforgeability, traceability, and resistance to coalition attacks, the proposed PBATAS is provably secure. Performance analysis demonstrates that PBATAS is effective.},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are designed to provide traffic safety by enabling vehicles to broadcast information-such as speed, location and heading-through inter-vehicular communications to proactively avoid collisions. However, the attacks targeting these networks might overshadow their advantages if not protected against. One powerful threat against VANETs is vehicular botnets. In our earlier work, we demonstrated several vehicular botnet attacks that can have damaging impacts on the security and privacy of VANETs. In this paper, we present SHIELDNET, the first detection mechanism against vehicular botnets. Similar to the detection approaches against Internet botnets, we target the vehicular botnet communication and use several machine learning techniques to identify vehicular bots. We show via simulation that SHIELDNET can identify 77 percent of the vehicular bots. We propose several improvements on the VANET standards and show that their existing vulnerabilities make an effective defense against vehicular botnets infeasible.},

abstract={A plethora of recent work has shown that convolutional networks are not robust to adversarial images: images that are created by perturbing a sample from the data distribution as to maximize the loss on the perturbed example. In this work, we hypothesize that adversarial perturbations move the image away from the image manifold in the sense that there exists no physical process that could have produced the adversarial image. This hypothesis suggests that a successful defense mechanism against adversarial images should aim to project the images back onto the image manifold. We study such defense mechanisms, which approximate the projection onto the unknown image manifold by a nearest-neighbor search against a web-scale image database containing tens of billions of images. Empirical evaluations of this defense strategy on ImageNet suggest that it very effective in attack settings in which the adversary does not have access to the image database. We also propose two novel attack methods to break nearest-neighbor defense settings and show conditions under which nearest-neighbor defense fails. We perform a series of ablation experiments, which suggest that there is a trade-off between robustness and accuracy between as we use features from deeper in the network, that a large index size (hundreds of millions) is crucial to get good performance, and that careful construction of database is crucial for robustness against nearest-neighbor attacks.},

abstract={Security professionals, government agencies, and corporate organizations have found an inherent need to prevent or mitigate attacks from insider threats. Accordingly, active research on insider threat detection has been conducted to prevent and mitigate adverse effects such as leakage of valuable information that may be caused by insiders. Along with the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT), new security challenges arise in the existing security frameworks. Attack surfaces are significantly enlarged which could cause a severe risk in terms of company insider threat management. In this work, we provide a generalization of aspects of insider threats with IoT and analyze the surveyed literature based on both private and public sources. We then examine data sources considering IoT environments based on the characteristics and the structure of IoT (perceptual, network, and application layers). The result of reviewing the study shows that using the data source of the network and application layer is more suitable than the perceptual layer in the IoT environment. We also categorized each layer's data sources according to their features, and we investigated research objectives and methods for each category. Finally, the potential for utilization and limitations under the IoT environment are presented at the end of each layer examination.},

abstract={Vehicular Networks (VANET) are the largest real life application of ad-hoc networks where nodes are represented via fast moving vehicles. As VANET is characterised with several unique features such as the high mobility, random distribution and short connection times, etc. establishing security becomes very challenging, and identifying security threats and possible attacks become very critical. Thus, identifying, managing and exploiting risk across the different components of VANET have become increasingly important to ensure the success and the robustness of the VANET components and its applications. As VANET include different contexts, the risk posed by particular attack may have different impact, i.e., the risk caused by an attack in rural and urban area may have different consequences on the network. To this end, we propose a novel context-based risk assessment methodology to identify attacks in different contexts of VANET. The main aim of the paper is twofold: 1) First, we identified vulnerabilities, threats and attacks on important assets in VANET, and (2) secondly, we proposed a novel context-based risk assessment approach in VANET to identify the risks encountered by attacks in VANET in various contexts.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an analysis of HTTP traffic in a large-scale environment which uses network flow monitoring extended by parsing HTTP requests. In contrast to previously published analyses, we were the first to classify patterns of HTTP traffic which are relevant to network security. We described three classes of HTTP traffic which contain brute-force password attacks, connections to proxies, HTTP scanners, and web crawlers. Using the classification, we were able to detect up to 16 previously undetectable brute-force password attacks and 19 HTTP scans per day in our campus network. The activity of proxy servers and web crawlers was also observed. Symptoms of these attacks may be detected by other methods based on traditional flow monitoring, but detection using the analysis of HTTP requests is more straightforward. We, thus, confirm the added value of extended flow monitoring in comparison to the traditional method.},

abstract={This article proposes an algorithm which allows Alice to simulate the game played between her and Eve. Under the condition that the set of detectors that Alice assumes Eve to have is sufficiently rich (e.g. CNNs), and that she has an algorithm enabling to avoid detection by a single classifier (e.g adversarial embedding, gibbs sampler, dynamic STCs), the proposed algorithm converges to an efficient steganographic algorithm. This is possible by using a min max strategy which consists at each iteration in selecting the least detectable stego image for the best classifier among the set of Eve's learned classifiers. The algorithm is extensively evaluated and compared to prior arts and results show the potential to increase the practical security of classical steganographic methods. For example the error probability Perr of XU-Net on detecting stego images with payload of 0.4 bpnzAC embedded by J-Uniward and QF 75 starts at 7.1% and is increased by +13.6% to reach 20.7% after eight iterations. For the same embedding rate and for QF 95, undetectability by XU-Net with J-Uniward embedding is 23.4%, and it jumps by +25.8% to reach 49.2% at iteration 3.},

abstract={The fifth-generation and beyond mobile networks should support extremely high and diversified requirements from a wide variety of emerging applications. It is envisioned that more advanced radio transmission, resource allocation, and networking techniques are required to be developed. Fulfilling these tasks is challenging since network infrastructure becomes increasingly complicated and heterogeneous. One promising solution is to leverage the great potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which has been explored to provide solutions ranging from channel prediction to autonomous network management, as well as network security. As of today, however, the state of the art of integrating AI into wireless networks is mainly limited to use a dedicated AI algorithm to tackle a specific problem. A unified framework that can make full use of AI capability to solve a wide variety of network problems is still an open issue. Hence, this paper will present the concept of intelligence slicing where an AI module is instantiated and deployed on demand. Intelligence slices are applied to conduct different intelligent tasks with the flexibility of accommodating arbitrary AI algorithms. Two example slices, i.e., neural network based channel prediction and anomaly detection based industrial network security, are illustrated to demonstrate this framework.},

volume={6},

pages={75327-75341},
abstract={Massive amounts of misinformation have been spreading over social media during the 2016 U.S. election season, causing wide public concern about our information ecosystem. How does fact checking compete with misinformation for user attentions? How do misinformation and fact checking differ in their spreading patterns? And what strategies are used by social bots to promote the spread of misinformation? In this paper, we address these research questions by analyzing datasets collected by Hoaxy. We answer the first question by conducting: 1) a survival analysis shows that about 70% of claims will be fact-checked in one week and about 800 tweets with claim links are posted during this period, on average and 2) a cross-correlation analysis shows that the sharing of fact-checking articles typically lags that of misinformation by about one day. Regarding the second question, we answer it from three points of view: 1) we find that false claims can become more popular than the corresponding debunking; 2) when looking at the distribution of types of tweets, we find that fact checking tends to spread in a conversational way; and 3) bot behavior analysis shows that the most active accounts sharing misinformation behave more like social bots. To better understand how social bots spread misinformation, we conduct case studies to answer the third question. By presenting strategies such as the production of a large number of original tweets, the alternating and hijacking of hashtags, and the injection of content into conversations, we demonstrate how social bots take advantages of the recommendation features of Twitter to amplify the spread of misinformation.},

Part of this process is the deployment of an advanced metering infrastructure, which provides novel high-frequency two-way communication between consumers and producers. But as useful as the access to high-frequency measurements may be for energy suppliers, this also poses a major threat to the privacy of the customers. In this survey we present approaches to the problem of customer privacy-protection in the smart grid. We show that the privacy problem in smart grids can be further divided into the problems metering for billing and metering for operations.

abstract={The future Internet of Things (IoT) will have a deep economical, commercial and social impact on our lives. The participating nodes in IoT networks are usually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber attacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the security and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional cryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes render the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security spectrum of the IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to provide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, can be leveraged to cope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review the security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions for the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security solutions that call for ML and DL approaches. Finally, we discuss in detail the existing ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT networks.

abstract={Network functions virtualization (NFV), along with software-defined networking (SDN), drives a new change in networking infrastructure with respect to designing, deploying, and managing various network services. In particular, NFV has potential to significantly reduce the hardware cost, greatly improve operational efficiency, and dramatically shorten the development lifecycle of network service. It also makes network functions and services much more adaptive and scalable. Despite the promising advantages of NFV, security remains to be one of the vital concerns and potential hurdle, as attack surface becomes unclear and defense line turns to be blurred in the virtualization environment. This survey is therefore devoted to analyzing NFV from a security perspective. We first analyze security threats of five well-defined NFV use cases, with an objective to establishing a comprehensive layer-specific threat taxonomy. Second, we conduct in-depth comparative studies on several security mechanisms that are applied in traditional scenarios and in NFV environments. The purpose is to analyze their implicit relationships with NFV performance objectives in terms of feasibility, agility, effectiveness, and so on. Third, based on the established threat taxonomy and the analyzed security mechanisms, we provide a set of recommendations on securing NFV based services, along with the analysis on the state-of-the-art security countermeasures. A resulting holistic security framework is intended to lay a foundation for NFV service providers to deploy adaptive, scalable, and cost-effective security hardening based on their particular needs. Some future research directions are finally discussed.},

abstract={The use of mobile phones in public places opens up the possibilities of remote side channel attacks on these devices. We present a video-based side channel attack to decipher passwords on mobile devices. Our method uses short video clips ranging from 5 to 10 s each, which can be taken unobtrusively from a distance and do not require the keyboard or the screen of the phone to be visible. By relating the spatiotemporal movements of the user's hand during typing and an anchor point on any visible part of the phone, we predict the typed password with high accuracy. The results on a dataset of 375 short videos of password entry process on a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone show an exponential reduction in the search space compared to a random guess. For each key-press corresponding to a character in the passwords, our method was able to reduce the search space to an average of 2-3 keys compared to ~30 keys if one has to guess the key randomly. Thus, this paper reaffirms threats to smartphone users' conventional login in public places and highlights the threats in scenarios such as hiding the screen that otherwise gives the impression of being safe to the users.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of aggregating local binary descriptors for large scale image retrieval in mobile scenarios. Binary descriptors are becoming increasingly popular, especially in mobile applications, as they deliver high matching speed, have a small memory footprint and are fast to extract. However, little research has been done on how to efficiently aggregate binary descriptors. Direct application of methods developed for conventional descriptors, such as SIFT, results in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper we introduce and evaluate several algorithms to compress high-dimensional binary local descriptors, for efficient retrieval in large databases. In addition, we propose a robust global image representation; Binary Robust Visual Descriptor (B-RVD), with rank-based multi-assignment of local descriptors and direction-based aggregation, achieved by the use of L1-norm on residual vectors. The performance of the B-RVD is further improved by balancing the variances of residual vector directions in order to maximize the discriminatory power of the aggregated vectors. Standard datasets and measures have been used for evaluation showing significant improvement of around 4% mean Average Precision as compared to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={With the fast development of cloud computing, cloud demand has exploded. In order to meet the primary performance needs of cloud users, cloud service providers need to carry out load balancing policy for virtual machines (VMs), which exacerbates the co-residence threats. In this paper, we try to solve the problem from the perspective of VM management, that is to say, we optimize the VM management policy to reduce the chances that ordinary VMs resident with the malicious VMs. In previous researches, the basic idea is to make the attack as difficult as possible during the placement, but there is little discussion about how to retrieve after the attacker successfully co-resident. Compared with them, for the first time we introduce the concept of Familiarity to mark cloud users and their VMs, and then design a secure VM placement algorithm and a secure load balancing algorithm. These algorithms not only make the co-residence difficult but can handle the security issue after it happens. After evaluation, our algorithms can well achieve the expectations.},

abstract={All of four major U.S. operators have rolled out nationwide Wi-Fi calling services. They are projected to surpass VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and other VoIP services in terms of mobile IP voice usage minutes in 2018. They enable mobile users to place cellular calls over Wi-Fi networks based on the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) technology. Compared with conventional cellular voice solutions, the major difference lies in that their traffic traverses untrustful Wi-Fi networks and the Internet. This exposure to insecure networks may cause the Wi-Fi calling users to suffer from security threats. Its security mechanisms are similar to the VoLTE, because both of them are supported by the IMS. They include SIM-based security, 3GPP AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement), IPSec (Internet Protocol Security), etc. However, are they sufficient to secure Wi-Fi calling services? Unfortunately, our study yields a negative answer. In this work, we explore security issues of the operational Wi-Fi calling services in three major U.S. operators' networks using commodity devices. We disclose that current Wi-Fi calling security is not bullet-proof. We uncover four vulnerabilities which stem from improper standard designs, device implementation issues and network operation slips. By exploiting them, we devise two proof-of-concept attacks: user privacy leakage and telephony harassment or denial of voice service (THDoS); they can bypass the security defenses deployed on both mobile devices and network infrastructure. We have confirmed their feasibility and simplicity using real-world experiments, as well as assessed their potential damages and proposed recommended solutions.},

abstract={Botnets continue to be one of the most severe security threats plaguing the Internet. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of cloud-hosted botnets along with the increasing popularity of cloud platforms, which attracted not only various applications/services, but also botnets. However, even the latest botnet detection mechanisms (e.g., machine learning based) fail to meet the requirement of accurate and expeditious detection in data centers, because they often demand intensive resources to support traffic monitoring and collection, which is hardly practical considering the traffic volume in data centers. Furthermore, they provide little understanding on different phases of the bot activities, which is essential for identifying the malicious intent of bots in their early stages. In this paper, we propose BotSifter, an SDN based scalable, accurate and runtime bot detection framework for data centers. To achieve detection scalability, BotSifter utilizes centralized learning with distributed detection by distributing detection tasks across the network edges in SDN. Furthermore, it employs a variety of novel mechanisms for parallel detection of C&C channels and botnet activities, which greatly enhance the detection robustness. Evaluations demonstrate that BotSifter can achieve highly accurate detection for a large variety of botnet variants with diverse C&C protocols.},

abstract={Sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are usually battery-operated and resource-constrained. The sensor nodes are often deployed in remote areas where the batteries cannot easily be recharged or replaced. Consequently, power becomes a limited resource in WSNs. Thus, energy consumption of the sensor nodes is among parameters of paramount importance. Subsequently, source location privacy (SLP) routing schemes must be energy-efficient and overall cost-effective. Angle-based routing schemes can cost-effectively protect the SLP. The goal of this study is to propose a new path node offset angle routing algorithm to improve the packet transmission cost of two existing SLP routing schemes. The proposed algorithm considers path node offset angles, arbitrary factors, and contrived regions to compute relatively short but greatly randomized routing paths. The routes offer a reduced number of packet forwarding events in the near-sink region and eventually diminish the packet transmission cost. Performance analysis results verify that the proposed path node offset angle routing algorithm effectively improves the packet transmission cost of the schemes and guarantees strong SLP protection throughout the WSN domain. Furthermore, the routing algorithm is capable of alleviating the energy-hole problem.},

abstract={With the growth of cloud computing, many businesses, both small and large, are opting to use cloud services compelled by a great cost savings potential. This is especially true of public cloud computing which allows for quick, dynamic scalability without many overhead or long-term commitments. However, one of the largest dissuasions from using cloud services comes from the inherent and unknown danger of a shared platform such as the hyper visor. An attacker can attack a virtual machine (VM) and then go on to compromise the hyper visor. If successful, then all virtual machines on that hyper visor can become compromised. This is the problem of negative externalities, where the security of one player affects the security of another. This work shows that there are multiple Nash equilibria for the public cloud security game. It also demonstrates that we can allow the players' Nash equilibrium profile to not be dependent on the probability that the hyper visor is compromised, reducing the factor externality plays in calculating the equilibrium. Finally, by using our allocation method, the negative externality imposed onto other players can be brought to a minimum compared to other common VM allocation methods.},

abstract={Nowadays, more and more business and individuals tune to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications to rapidly access various software capabilities through the Internet. The more SaaS adoption evolves, the more software service providers compete for fast development to cope with the market pace. This trend pushes security after functionality-needs in the priority list. This, in turn, results in delivering applications with potential security risk. The risk is further elevated due to the lack of visibility, control, and regulatory enforcements over consumers' data associated with such applications. Motivated by the raised necessity to consider security-needs at the same priority as functionality-needs, this paper proposes a comprehensive platform to interweave security activities and services from inception through deployment and beyond. Such activities and services are based on information flow control. The platform specifically envisions these activities to devote security into every phase of the development lifecycle of SaaS applications and offer different style of defenses as security services. It promotes for shared security responsibility to gain twofold benefits: a) it helps service providers to protect their SaaS applications from prevalent security threats; b) it enables SaaS consumers to choose a protected application to process their sensitive data with a trust in its security.},

However, the majority of works evaluating the security degree of smartphones neglects steganography, which can be mainly used to: i) exfiltrate confidential data via camouflage methods, and ii) conceal valuable or personal information into innocent looking carriers. Therefore, this paper surveys the state of the art of steganographic techniques for smartphones, with emphasis on methods developed over the period 2005 to the second quarter of 2014. The different approaches are grouped according to the portion of the device used to hide information, leading to three different covert channels, i.e., local, object and network. Also, it reviews the relevant approaches used to detect and mitigate steganographic attacks or threats. Lastly, it showcases the most popular software applications to embed secret data into carriers, as well as possible future directions.},

abstract={Nowadays, large volumes of multimedia data are outsourced to the cloud to better serve mobile applications. Along with this trend, highly correlated datasets can occur commonly, where the rich information buried in correlated data is useful for many cloud data generation/dissemination services. In light of this, we propose to enable a secure and efficient cloud-assisted image sharing architecture for mobile devices, by leveraging outsourced encrypted image datasets with privacy assurance. Different from traditional image sharing, we aim to provide a mobile-friendly design that saves the transmission cost for mobile clients, by directly utilizing outsourced correlated images to reproduce the image of interest inside the cloud for immediate dissemination. First, we propose a secure and efficient index design that allows the mobile client to securely find from encrypted image datasets the candidate selection pertaining to the image of interest for sharing. We then design two specialized encryption mechanisms that support secure image reproduction from encrypted candidate selection. We formally analyze the security strength of the design. Our experiments explicitly show that both the bandwidth and energy consumptions at the mobile client can be saved, while achieving all service requirements and security guarantees.},

abstract={The tactile internet (TI) is believed to be the prospective advancement of the internet of things (IoT), comprising human-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication. TI focuses on enabling real-time interactive techniques with a portfolio of engineering, social, and commercial use cases. For this purpose, the prospective $5^{th}$ generation (5G) technology focuses on achieving ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) services. TI applications require an extraordinary degree of reliability and latency. The $3^{rd}$ generation partnership project (3GPP) defines that URLLC is expected to provide 99.99% reliability of a single transmission of 32 bytes packet with a latency of less than one millisecond. 3GPP proposes to include an adjustable orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, called 5G new radio (5G NR), as a new radio access technology (RAT). Whereas, with the emergence of a novel physical layer RAT, the need for the design for prospective next-generation technologies arises, especially with the focus of network intelligence. In such situations, machine learning (ML) techniques are expected to be essential to assist in designing intelligent network resource allocation protocols for 5G NR URLLC requirements. Therefore, in this survey, we present a possibility to use the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) technique, which is one of the ML techniques, for 5G NR URLLC requirements and summarizes the corresponding achievements for URLLC. We provide a comprehensive discussion of MAC layer channel access mechanisms that enable URLLC in 5G NR for TI. Besides, we identify seven very critical future use cases of FRL as potential enablers for URLLC in 5G NR.},

abstract={Millions of sensors continuously produce and transmit data to control real-world infrastructures using complex networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT devices are limited in computational power, including storage, processing, and communication resources, to effectively perform compute-intensive tasks locally. Edge computing resolves the resource limitation problems by bringing computation closer to the edge of IoT devices. Providing distributed edge nodes across the network reduces the stress of centralized computation and overcomes latency challenges in the IoT. Therefore, edge computing presents low-cost solutions for compute-intensive tasks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables effective network management by presenting a global perspective of the network. While SDN was not explicitly developed for IoT challenges, it can, however, provide impetus to solve the complexity issues and help in efficient IoT service orchestration. The current IoT paradigm of massive data generation, complex infrastructures, security vulnerabilities, and requirements from the newly developed technologies make IoT realization a challenging issue. In this research, we provide an extensive survey on SDN and the edge computing ecosystem to solve the challenge of complex IoT management. We present the latest research on Software-Defined Internet of Things orchestration using Edge (SDIoT-Edge) and highlight key requirements and standardization efforts in integrating these diverse architectures. An extensive discussion on different case studies using SDIoT-Edge computing is presented to envision the underlying concept. Furthermore, we classify state-of-the-art research in the SDIoT-Edge ecosystem based on multiple performance parameters. We comprehensively present security and privacy vulnerabilities in the SDIoT-Edge computing and provide detailed taxonomies of multiple attack possibilities in this paradigm. We highlight the lessons learned based on our findings at the end of each section. Finally, we discuss critical insights toward current research issues, challenges, and further research directions to efficiently provide IoT services in the SDIoT-Edge paradigm.},

abstract={Semagrams are a subset of steganography. When a message is transmitted in a non-textual format, (i.e., in the visual content of an image), it is referred to as a semagram. While semagrams are relatively easy to create (as shown in published papers covering hiding techniques), detecting a hidden message in or embedded as an image-based semagram is a greater magnitude of difficultly than typical digital steganography. US Patents issued based on semagram technology show that this feature has been exploited in the copyright/watermarking world to increase protection. In a semagram, the image is the message and they work well for simple messages and dead drops. Attacks on semagrams are primarily visual examinations of artifacts. In the counter-espionage world, the rule of the thumb is that there is always a message hidden in an image or graphic, it is simply up to the steganalyst to find it. In short, detecting semagrams is a matter of recognizing patterns of patterns that represent a hidden message within an image. This presentation provides a brief summary of the technology underlying semagrams, present a short non-technical discussion of the technology used in the attack on semagrams, followed by a discussion on current work and planned future implementations of the proven semagram detection ANN. It will focus on extending the ANN to other domains (e.g., non-visual spectrums, multi/cross spectrum correlation, scene identification, image classification) and efforts to improve the processing speed and throughput via parallel/distributed methods.},

An analyzing attack on optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol which is proactive, we propose a reputation base mechanism for prevention attacks. The mechanism is useful for securing the OLSR protocol against the denial of service attack (i.e. node isolation attack). Our mechanism is capable of finding whether a node is presenting correct network topology information or not by confirming its HELLO message. The experimental simulation results show the protocol is able to achieve routing security mechanism with increasing throughput, packet delivery frequency and control overhead. Our proposed mechanism is light weight because the protocol doesn't include with high computational complexity for securing OLSR protocol against the node isolation attacks in MANETs. This mechanism brings few modifications and still compatible with the OLSR protocol. In order to evaluate network parameters by using network simulator (NS-2) tool.},

abstract={We describe the application in security of shells of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals (ChLCs). Such shells have a diameter in the microns range and can be gathered in hundreds in a surface area as small as a nail's head. Because of their structural properties, a bundle of them reflects light, creating colorful patterns that we argue to be unique and computationally hard to predict. We argue also that the bundle itself is unclonable. These are typical properties of Physically Unclonable Functions, a family to which shells of ChLCs belong too. Herein we discuss their physical and security properties and their potential use in object authentication.},

pages={330-335},
abstract={The information-centric networking, which aims to solve the demand for distributing a large amount of content on the Internet, has proved to be a promising example for various network solutions, such as the Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). However, some problems are introduced when the named data networking is combined with V-NDN, such as the cache pollution. In order to solve the cache pollution attack, we propose a mechanism based on cache partition, which divides the cache of nodes into two parts and stores the content of different popularity respectively. We monitor the interest packets received by each node and get the corresponding popularity of each content. According to the popularity of the content, the content is stored in the corresponding cache. In addition, when the popularity of the content changes, we add the name of the content to the monitoring list to determine whether it is an attack content. This paper simulates the cache partition mechanism under different request frequencies and different forwarding strategies. The experimental results show that the average hit rate of node cache can be increased by 14% and the user request delay can be reduced by 30% when the node is attacked. At the same time, the number of Interest packets requested by normal users in the whole network has also been greatly reduced, which greatly reduces the traffic within the network. Experiments show that the cache partition mechanism can effectively resist the attack of cache pollution.},

abstract={Within the next few years, billions of IoT devices will densely populate our cities. In this paper we describe a new type of threat in which adjacent IoT devices will infect each other with a worm that will rapidly spread over large areas, provided that the density of compatible IoT devices exceeds a certain critical mass. In particular, we developed and verified such an infection using the popular Philips Hue smart lamps as a platform. The worm spreads by jumping directly from one lamp to its neighbors, using only their built-in ZigBee wireless connectivity and their physical proximity. The attack can start by plugging in a single infected bulb anywhere in the city, and then catastrophically spread everywhere within minutes. It enables the attacker to turn all the city lights on or off, to permanently brick them, or to exploit them in a massive DDOS attack. To demonstrate the risks involved, we use results from percolation theory to estimate the critical mass of installed devices for a typical city such as Paris whose area is about 105 square kilometers: The chain reaction will fizzle if there are fewer than about 15,000 randomly located smart lamps in the whole city, but will spread everywhere when the number exceeds this critical mass (which had almost certainly been surpassed already). To make such an attack possible, we had to find a way to remotely yank already installed lamps from their current networks, and to perform over-the-air firmware updates. We overcame the first problem by discovering and exploiting a major bug in the implementation of the Touchlink part of the ZigBee Light Link protocol, which is supposed to stop such attempts with a proximity test. To solve the second problem, we developed a new version of a side channel attack to extract the global AES-CCM key (for each device type) that Philips uses to encrypt and authenticate new firmware. We used only readily available equipment costing a few hundred dollars, and managed to find this key without seeing any actual updates. This demonstrates once again how difficult it is to get security right even for a large company that uses standard cryptographic techniques to protect a major product.},

abstract={Electroencephalographic signals are known to be nonstationary and easily affected by artifacts; therefore, their analysis requires methods that can deal with noise. In this work, we present a way to robustify the popular common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm under a maxmin approach. In contrast to standard CSP that maximizes the variance ratio between two conditions based on a single estimate of the class covariance matrices, we propose to robustly compute spatial filters by maximizing the minimum variance ratio within a prefixed set of covariance matrices called the tolerance set. We show that this kind of maxmin optimization makes CSP robust to outliers and reduces its tendency to overfit. We also present a data-driven approach to construct a tolerance set that captures the variability of the covariance matrices over time and shows its ability to reduce the nonstationarity of the extracted features and significantly improve classification accuracy. We test the spatial filters derived with this approach and compare them to standard CSP and a state-of-the-art method on a real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) data set in which we expect substantial fluctuations caused by environmental differences. Finally we investigate the advantages and limitations of the maxmin approach with simulations.},

The lack of physical boundaries and the dependence on third party's infrastructural security mechanisms often undermine the confidence in the overall security level of virtualized applications. Integrating software instances of common security middleboxes into cloud networks helps overcome most suspicions, but leads to inefficient solutions. In this paper, we describe the vision behind the ASTRID project. The novelty of our concept lies in decoupling detection algorithms from monitoring and inspection tasks, seeking better integration with virtualization frameworks. We briefly elaborate on the overall conceptual architecture and the foundation of its implementation components. Additionally, we give insights on the expected impacts and opportunities brought by this novel paradigm over the existing approaches.},

pages={658-672},
abstract={In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), nodes usually cooperate and forward each other's packets in order to enable out of range communication. However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.},

Cyberspace poses unique challenges and opportunities; we distinguish new elements that may be used for targeting inter alia for active defence purposes, namely cyber objects and cyber identities. Constructive or disruptive cyber operations aimed at these non-physical elements provide new ways of attaining effects. Assessing the outcome of these cyber operations is, however, challenging for planners. Intertwined network infrastructure and the global nature of cyberspace add to the complexity, but these difficulties can be overcome. In principle, the targeting cycle is suitable for cyber operations, yet, with an eye to (a) the effectiveness of offensive and defensive operations, and (b) legal obligations, special attention will be required regarding effects in general, and collateral damage assessment in particular.},

pages={98-110},
abstract={Due to limited computational power and energy resources, aggregation of data from multiple sensor nodes done at the aggregating node is usually accomplished by simple methods such as averaging. However such aggregation is known to be highly vulnerable to node compromising attacks. Since WSN are usually unattended and without tamper resistant hardware, they are highly susceptible to such attacks. Thus, ascertaining trustworthiness of data and reputation of sensor nodes is crucial for WSN. As the performance of very low power processors dramatically improves, future aggregator nodes will be capable of performing more sophisticated data aggregation algorithms, thus making WSN less vulnerable. Iterative filtering algorithms hold great promise for such a purpose. Such algorithms simultaneously aggregate data from multiple sources and provide trust assessment of these sources, usually in a form of corresponding weight factors assigned to data provided by each source. In this paper we demonstrate that several existing iterative filtering algorithms, while significantly more robust against collusion attacks than the simple averaging methods, are nevertheless susceptive to a novel sophisticated collusion attack we introduce. To address this security issue, we propose an improvement for iterative filtering techniques by providing an initial approximation for such algorithms which makes them not only collusion robust, but also more accurate and faster converging.},

volume={26},

pages={3303-3316},
abstract={Due to the unprecedented growth of unedited videos, finding highlights relevant to a text query in a set of unedited videos has become increasingly important. We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) “viralets”, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including users' comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.).1Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.},

abstract={Adversarial examples are maliciously tweaked images that can easily fool machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, but they are normally not visually distinguishable for human beings. One of the main approaches to solve this problem is to retrain the networks using those adversarial examples, namely adversarial training. However, standard adversarial training might not actually change the decision boundaries but cause the problem of gradient masking, resulting in a weaker ability to generate adversarial examples [39]. Therefore, it cannot alleviate the problem of black-box attacks, where adversarial examples generated from other networks can transfer to the targeted one. In order to reduce the problem of black-box attacks, we propose a novel method that allows two networks to learn from each others' adversarial examples and become resilient to black-box attacks. We also combine this method with a simple domain adaptation to further improve the performance.},

abstract={The desire to preserve privacy in cyberspace drives research in the area of anonymous networks. Any entity operating in cyberspace is susceptible to debilitating cyber attacks. As part of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, the United States acknowledges that the speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult. Indeed, today's Internet is an incredibly effective, uncontrolled weapon for eavesdropping and spying. Therefore, anonymity and privacy are increasingly important issues. A plethora of existing or proposed anonymous networks achieve diverse levels of anonymity against a variety of adversarial attacks. However, no known taxonomy provides a comprehensive classification of the varied set of wired, wireless, and hybrid anonymous communications networks. We develop a novel cubic taxonomy to facilitate the systematic definition and classification of anonymity in anonymous communications networks. Three key anonymity components: anonymity property, adversary capability, and network type are thoroughly explored. More importantly, an in-depth description of a new tree-based taxonomy for the state-of-the-art in wireless anonymous protocols is offered. For completeness, a tree-based taxonomy of wired and hybrid anonymous protocols are also provided. Lastly, several evolving anonymity metrics which quantify anonymity preservation, degradation, and elimination in existing and future anonymous networks are examined. Hence, this paper explores extant and emerging issues in anonymous networks via an intuitive taxonomy and surveys anonymous protocols and quantifiable metrics essential for any entity determined to assure anonymity and preserve privacy in cyberspace against an adversary.},

pages={3694-3708},
abstract={Low Entropy Masking Schemes (LEMS) have attracted wide attention due to their implementations simplicity and relatively good performance in protecting cryptographic implementations against Side-Channel-Attacks (SCAs). To achieve desired security, it is necessary (but not sufficient) to find proper low entropy mask sets to protect all sensitive secret-dependant intermediate variables. However, one crucial problem concerning this intuitive idea is that what `proper' mask sets should be. To formally capture such crucial qualification, we introduce the notion of balancedness to characterize this natural attribute of mask sets themselves. Considering that this notion is limited to characterize first-order security, we generalize it to d-dimension balancedness to accommodate dth-order security, then we exhibit lower and upper bounds on d-dimension balancedness for any d. With the help of these essential definitions, we prove that no balanced low entropy mask set really exists, which implies that LEMS implementations always have vulnerabilities in theory due to the unbalancedness of underlying mask sets. In order to further demonstrate the practical implications of balancedness, we show 4 different kinds of attacks on three state-of-the-art LEMS implementations. Specifically, the distribution attack proposed in this paper is a general first-order attack on LEMS. The results demonstrate that unbalanced mask sets actually do lead to serious vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Leakage of user location and traffic patterns is a serious security threat with significant implications on privacy as reported by recent surveys and identified by the US Congress Location Privacy Protection Act of 2014. While mobile phones can restrict the explicit access to location information to applications authorized by the user, they are ill-equipped to protect against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we show that a zero-permissions Android app can infer vehicular users' location and traveled routes, with high accuracy and without the users' knowledge, using gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer information. We modeled this problem as a maximum likelihood route identification on a graph. The graph is generated from the OpenStreetMap publicly available database of roads. Our route identification algorithms output both a ranked list of potential routes as well a ranked list of route-clusters. Through extensive simulations over 11 cities, we show that for most cities with probability higher than 50% it is possible to output a short list of 10 routes containing the traveled route. In real driving experiments (over 980 Km) in the cities of Boston (resp. Waltham), Massachusetts, we report a probability of 30% (resp. 60%) of inferring a list of 10 routes containing the true route.},

abstract={Although neural network-based classifiers outperform humans in a range of tasks, they are still prone to manipulation through adversarial perturbations. Prior research has resulted in the identification of effective defense mechanisms for many reported attack methods, however a defense against the C&W attack, as well as a holistic defense mechanism capable of countering multiple different attack methods, are still missing. All attack methods reported so far share a common goal. They aim to avoid detection by limiting the allowed perturbation magnitude, and still trigger incorrect classification. As a result, small perturbations cause classification to shift from one class to another. We coined the term activation spaces to refer to the hyperspaces formed by the activation values of the different network layers. We then use activation spaces to capture the differences in spatial dynamics between normal and adversarial examples, and form a novel adversarial example detector. We induce a set of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, one per activation space, and leverage those classifiers to assign a sequence of class labels to each input of the neural network. We then calculate the likelihood of each observed label sequence and show that sequences associated with adversarial examples are far less likely than those of normal examples. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed detector against the C&W attack using two image classification datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) achieving an AUC of 0.97 for the CIFAR-10 dataset. We further show how our detector can be easily augmented with previously suggested defense methods to form a holistic multi-purpose defense mechanism.},

abstract={The proliferation of smart phones and ubiquitous Internet access enable the emergence of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) as an effective policy to increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace. The adoption of BYOD, however, gives rise to a number of security threats, including sensitive information infiltration and exfiltration, DoS attacks and privacy violation. This work proposes a framework to address precisely this issue. The main focus of the paper is on exploring the viability of BYOD in supporting collaboration among team members, in a heterogeneous mobile computing environments. The basic tenet of this work is to leverage artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision tree (DT) machine learning (ML) techniques to identify any attempts for access to sensitive information by nonlegitimate users and to facilitate the framework to baffle their access, in order to protect the data. The goal becomes even more challenging, incorporating the demands for low latency and high accuracy of the framework. The main contributions of the include the formulation of the BYOD unauthorized access control problem, a framework that uses ANN and DT ML techniques to detect anomalous behaviors and to identify unauthorized access to resources on BYOD devices. The proposed security techniques are implemented and evaluated, using a real dataset.},

abstract={Developing highly efficient routing protocols for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) is a challenging task. In order to fulfill multiple routing requirements, such as low packet delay, high packet delivery rate, and effective adaptation to network topology changes with low control overhead, and so on, new ways to approximate solutions to the known NP-hard optimization problem of routing in MANETs have to be investigated. Swarm intelligence (SI)-inspired algorithms have attracted a lot of attention, because they can offer possible optimized solutions ensuring high robustness, flexibility, and low cost. Moreover, they can solve large-scale sophisticated problems without a centralized control entity. A successful example in the SI field is the ant colony optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic. It presents a common framework for approximating solutions to NP-hard optimization problems. ACO has been successfully applied to balance the various routing related requirements in dynamic MANETs. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and comparison of various ACO-based routing protocols in MANETs. The main contributions of this survey include: 1) introducing the ACO principles as applied in routing protocols for MANETs; 2) classifying ACO-based routing approaches reviewed in this paper into five main categories; 3) surveying and comparing the selected routing protocols from the perspective of design and simulation parameters; and 4) discussing open issues and future possible design directions of ACO-based routing protocols.},

The knowledge of this attack can be exploited by several applications both in security and in network equipment manufacturing sectors.},

The purpose of this current paper is to revisit the topic of computer and network security, and see what changes, especially in types of attacks, have been brought about in 30 years. This paper starts by presenting a review of the state of computer and network security in 1986, along with how certain facets of it have changed. Next, it talks about today's security environment, and finally discusses some of today's many computer and network attack methods that are new or greatly updated since 1986. Many references for further study are provided. The classes of attacks that are known today are the same as the ones known in 1986, but many new methods of implementing the attacks have been enabled by new technologies and the increased pervasiveness of computers and networks in today's society. The threats and specific types of attacks faced by the computer community 30 years ago have not gone away. New threat methods and attack vectors have opened due to advancing technology, supplementing and enhancing, rather than replacing the long-standing threat methods.},

abstract={Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest mobile communication standard and has a pivotal role in our information society: LTE combines performance goals with modern security mechanisms and serves casual use cases as well as critical infrastructure and public safety communications. Both scenarios are demanding towards a resilient and secure specification and implementation of LTE, as outages and open attack vectors potentially lead to severe risks. Previous work on LTE protocol security identified crucial attack vectors for both the physical (layer one) and network (layer three) layers. Data link layer (layer two) protocols, however, remain a blind spot in existing LTE security research. In this paper, we present a comprehensive layer two security analysis and identify three attack vectors. These attacks impair the confidentiality and/or privacy of LTE communication. More specifically, we first present a passive identity mapping attack that matches volatile radio identities to longer lasting network identities, enabling us to identify users within a cell and serving as a stepping stone for follow-up attacks. Second, we demonstrate how a passive attacker can abuse the resource allocation as a side channel to perform website fingerprinting that enables the attacker to learn the websites a user accessed. Finally, we present the A LTE R attack that exploits the fact that LTE user data is encrypted in counter mode (AES-CTR) but not integrity protected, which allows us to modify the message payload. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show how an active attacker can redirect DNS requests and then perform a DNS spoofing attack. As a result, the user is redirected to a malicious website. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the real-world applicability of all three attacks and emphasizes the threat of open attack vectors on LTE layer two protocols.},

abstract={Over the past decade, the Web has been transformed from a collection of static HTML pages to a complex, distributed computing platform, as evidenced of the success are sites such as Facebook and YouTube. This transformation has been enabled primarily by the continuous development of Web applications. Inevitably-due to the Internet architecture-Web applications must rely on the servers so as to process and store confidential or user sensitive information. However, anyone who gains access to the server whether is a curious administrator, an attacker or even the government may obtain the data stored on the server or the server's database. This paper investigates ways to improve client-side security, through encryption, to keep user data private in the face of threats of various Web server compromises. A Web Application for online-note taking named Note Locker has been developed for this purpose by combining not only multiple security mechanisms but also modern Web development techniques to achieve confidentiality, integrity and a high level of user experience. The application is developed using open source products and eliminates possible attacks such as eavesdropping, sniffing, wiretapping, man-in-the-middle, and session hijacking of sensitive data by encrypting the data on the client side before sent for storage on the server.},

In this paper, we suggest a hierarchical approach for MSNM with two main benefits: it minimizes the amount of data to be transferred through the network, and it provides privacy capabilities. We test the feasibility as well as the detection performance of the proposal within an experimental environment, obtaining detection results that are similar to non-hierarchical MSNM, but exhibiting a considerable reduction in the amount of information sent through the network.},

Then we propose a framework for differentially privacy-preserving social media data outsourcing for the first time in literature. Within our framework, social media data service providers can outsource perturbed datasets to provide users differential privacy while offering high data utility to social media data consumers. Our differential privacy mechanism is based on a novel notion of E - text indistinguishability, which we propose to thwart the text-based user-linkage attack. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets confirm that our framework can enable high-level differential privacy protection and also high data utility.},

abstract={A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a dynamic ad hoc network without any fixed infrastructure. Since it is dynamic in nature, it can configure and vary locations by itself, on the move. Since devices in a MANET are autonomous and can move in any direction, they change links with other devices very often. One of the principal challenges in building a MANET is to properly route traffic in order to constantly maintain the information needed by equipping each device. Those kinds of networks can be self-operated or may be linked to the larger internet. They may have one or more - and different - transceivers between nodes, resulting in highly dynamic and autonomous topology. The primary focus is on attacks on MANET, followed by malicious node-detection through a polynomial reduction algorithm. Though scientists have evaluated algorithms for detecting and rectifying malicious nodes, the issue still lingers. As a result of record growth in technology, unknown vulnerabilities are also surfacing. Therefore, to prevent attacks on MANET, it is imperative to propose novel ideas. In this paper, an ns-2 simulator is used to ambush malicious nodes in MANET.},

To deal with these challenges, various efforts are being made to transform the existing power grid into a so-called smart grid. Part of this process is the deployment of an advanced metering infrastructure, which provides novel high-frequency two-way communication between consumers and producers. But as useful as the access to high-frequency measurements may be for energy suppliers, this also poses a major threat to the privacy of the customers. In this survey we present approaches to the problem of customer privacy-protection in the smart grid. We show that the privacy problem in smart grids can be further divided into the problems metering for billing and metering for operations.

abstract={Through decentralized ledger, Bitcoin rebuilds trust and achieves payment verification. However, the verification of Bitcoin transactions requires nodes to download the whole blockchain, which is infeasible for resource-constraint devices. Traditional schemes tried to transfer most of the storage and computation tasks from a lightweight client to a full node. Nevertheless, these schemes would severely violate users' privacy since they would leak transaction ID and public-key address when a lightweight client queries the full node. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving approach to secure queries of simplified payment verification (SPV) clients. Specifically, we design a d-differentially private mechanism based on trusted hardware such that semi-honest adversaries cannot acquire the real access pattern during shards retrieval phase. Data-oblivious primitives are adopted to prevent the internal search pattern leakage owing to side-channel attacks. Our scheme is more secure than traditional SPV schemes, and it is proved to satisfy d-differential privacy definition. Our prototype implementation with the Bitcoin blockchain dataset shows its practicality.},

abstract={While neural networks demonstrate stronger capabilities in pattern recognition nowadays, they are also becoming larger and deeper. As a result, the effort needed to train a network also increases dramatically. In many cases, it is more practical to use a neural network intellectual property (IP) that an IP vendor has already trained. As we do not know about the training process, there can be security threats in the neural IP: the IP vendor (attacker) may embed hidden malicious functionality, i.e neural Trojans, into the neural IP. We show that this is an effective attack and provide three mitigation techniques: input anomaly detection, re-training, and input preprocessing. All the techniques are proven effective. The input anomaly detection approach is able to detect 99.8% of Trojan triggers although with 12.2% false positive. The re-training approach is able to prevent 94.1% of Trojan triggers from triggering the Trojan although it requires that the neural IP be reconfigurable. In the input preprocessing approach, 90.2% of Trojan triggers are rendered ineffective and no assumption about the neural IP is needed.},

abstract={Motion is a crucial source of information for a variety of tasks in social interactions. The process of how humans recognize complex articulated movements such as gestures or face expressions remains largely unclear. There is an ongoing discussion if and how explicit low-level motion information, such as optical flow, is involved in the recognition process. Motivated by this discussion, we introduce a computational model that classifies the spatial configuration of gradient and optical flow patterns. The patterns are learned with an unsupervised learning algorithm based on translation-invariant nonnegative sparse coding called VNMF that extracts prototypical optical flow patterns shaped, for example, as moving heads or limb parts. A key element of the proposed system is a lateral inhibition term that suppresses activations of competing patterns in the learning process, leading to a low number of dominant and topological sparse activations. We analyze the classification performance of the gradient and optical flow patterns on three real-world human action recognition and one face expression recognition data set. The results indicate that the recognition of human actions can be achieved by gradient patterns alone, but adding optical flow patterns increases the classification performance. The combined patterns outperform other biological-inspired models and are competitive with current computer vision approaches.},

abstract={A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an independent and self-configurable network without any fixed infrastructure. Compared to traditional network, MANETs have unique characteristics such as wireless shared radio medium, limited communication range, highly dynamic topology, power constraints and lack of trusted centralized authority. When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge. In this paper, we briefly introduce routing protocols, examine the behavior of various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at the network layer of MANET and provide comprehensive survey of the existing defense approaches to these attacks.},

abstract={JavaScript-based malware attacks have increased in recent years and currently represent a signicant threat to the use of desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets. While static and runtime methods for malware detection have been proposed in the literature, both on the client side, for just-in-time in-browser detection, as well as offline, crawler-based malware discovery, these approaches encounter the same fundamental limitation. Web-based malware tends to be environment-specific, targeting a particular browser, often attacking specic versions of installed plugins. This targeting occurs because the malware exploits vulnerabilities in specific plugins and fails otherwise. As a result, a fundamental limitation for detecting a piece of malware is that malware is triggered infrequently, only showing itself when the right environment is present. We observe that, using fingerprinting techniques that capture and exploit unique properties of browser configurations, almost all existing malware can be made virtually impssible for malware scanners to detect. This paper proposes Rozzle, a JavaScript multi-execution virtual machine, as a way to explore multiple execution paths within a single execution so that environment-specific malware will reveal itself. Using large-scale experiments, we show that Rozzle increases the detection rate for offline runtime detection by almost seven times. In addition, Rozzle triples the effectiveness of online runtime detection. We show that Rozzle incurs virtually no runtime overhead and allows us to replace multiple VMs running different browser configurations with a single Rozzle-enabled browser, reducing the hardware requirements, network bandwidth, and power consumption.},

Generally speaking, texture areas would be assigned low cost, while smooth areas with high cost. However, the prior methods are still not precise enough to capture image details. In this paper, we present a novel scheme of defining cost function for adaptive steganography at the microscale. The proposed scheme is designed by using a “microscope” to highlight fine details in an image so that distortion definition can be more refined. Experiments show that by adopting our scheme, the current steganographic methods (WOW, UNIWARD, HILL) will achieve better performances on resisting the state-of-the-art steganalysis.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely adopted in various areas such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, many works show that DNNs for image classification are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are generated by adding small-magnitude perturbations to the original inputs. In this paper, we show that DNNs for Chinese text classification are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. We propose a marginal attack method to generate adversarial examples that could fool the DNNs. This method adopts the Naïve Bayes principle to filter sensitive words and it only adds a small number of sensitive words at the end of the original text. The generated adversarial example could fool a variety of Chinese text classification DNNs, such that the text would be classified to incorrect category with high probability. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the attack performance and the results show that the success ratio of the attacks could reach almost 100% by adding only five sensitive words.},

abstract={Crypto-ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts user files, deletes the original data, and asks for a ransom to recover the hijacked documents. It is a cyber threat that targets both companies and residential users, and has spread in recent years because of its lucrative results. Several articles have presented classifications of ransomware families and their typical behaviour. These insights have stimulated the creation of detection techniques for antivirus and firewall software. However, because the ransomware scene evolves quickly and aggressively, these studies quickly become outdated. In this study, we surveyed the detection techniques that the research community has developed in recent years. We compared the different approaches and classified the algorithms based on the input data they obtain from ransomware actions, and the decision procedures they use to reach a classification decision between benign or malign applications. This is a detailed survey that focuses on detection algorithms, compared to most previous studies that offer a survey of ransomware families or isolated proposals of detection algorithms. We also compared the results of these proposals.},

abstract={Authentication is an important issue in wireless communications because the open nature of the wireless medium provides more security vulnerabilities. Recently, Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) attracts many research interests because it provides information-theory security and low complexity. Although many researchers focus on the PLA and exploit its potential in enhancing wireless security, the literature is surprisingly sparse with no comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art PLA and the key fundamentals involved. Thus, this article provides a detailed survey of features and techniques that can be used in the PLA. We categorize the existing PLA schemes into two categories: passive and active schemes. In the passive schemes, a receiver authenticates the transmitter based on the physical-layer features of the received signals. We further divide the passive schemes into two sub-categories: device-based features and channel-based features. In the active schemes, a transmitter generates a tag based on a secret key and embeds it into a source message. Then, a receiver authenticates the transmitter based on the tag whether it exists in the received signal. We further divide active schemes into two sub-categories: non-covert schemes and covert schemes. Moreover, we also provide some future research directions.},

abstract={Ride-hailing service has become a popular means of transportation due to its convenience and low cost. However, it also raises privacy concerns. Since riders' mobility information including the pick-up and drop-off location is tracked, the service provider can infer sensitive information about the riders such as where they live and work. To address these concerns, we propose location privacy preserving techniques that efficiently match riders and drivers while preserving riders' location privacy. We first propose a baseline solution that allows a rider to select the driver who is the closest to his pick-up location. However, with some side information, the service provider can launch location inference attacks. To overcome these attacks, we propose an enhanced scheme that allows a rider to specify his privacy preference. Novel techniques are designed to preserve rider's personalized privacy with limited loss of matching accuracy. Through trace-driven simulations, we compare our enhanced privacy preserving solution to existing work. Evaluation results show that our solution provides much better ride matching results that are close to the optimal solution, while preserving personalized location privacy for riders.},

Of the different strategies used to launch these attacks, the HTTP Unbearable Load King (HULK) DDoS attack method has been known to have devastating consequences when pulled off, because it is made to evade most firewall rules by its form of execution. The ZigBee network, which has existing security features to guard against cyber-attacks, will require extra measures to augment the AES-128 encryption standard it currently implements. This work investigates the HULK threat against a ZigBee network, with a goal to implement a security method that uses the machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are tested to identify the best algorithm in detecting anomalies in traffic to fortify the ZigBee network framework.},

abstract={Wireless communications employing multi-carrier transmissions, like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SCFDMA) may involve the use of a large number of subcarriers. In Internet of Things (IoT) contexts, however, the use of such technologies implies the fast management of large amounts of samples on devices with limited memory and computational resources. The adoption of physical layer authentication protocols in IoT may suffer from this fact, especially when they exploit machine learning algorithms yielding a significant computational burden. For instance, the complexity of Nearest Neighbor classifiers strictly depends on the training set dimension, which is directly proportional to the number of used subcarriers. In order to deal with this issue, we start from a naive approach based on random sampling of the input data to extract features, and then consider more advanced data dimension reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We show that PCA is able to guarantee the best trade-off between authentication performance and complexity, while the application of t-SNE is effective when one wants to reduce data to a very small number of features.},

volume={12},

pages={1900-1915},
abstract={Skin texture without obvious features is different from other hard biometrics on the skin, such as fingerprints and palmprints. Skin texture gives an impression that it is not distinctive like other soft biometric traits. It was proposed for personal identification a decade ago but did not draw attention from the biometric community, partially due to the success of other biometric technologies for commercial applications. However, in some forensic cases, e.g., identifying masked terrorists in images, skin texture may be the only option. Faces, tattoos, and skin marks are not always available for identification. To address these forensic needs, researchers have recently attempted to visualize blood vessels hidden in color images. Their performance is highly sensitive to image quality. Skin texture that is easily captured even in low-resolution images, such as that of the forearm skin, is suitable for these forensic applications. To study the distinctiveness of low-resolution skin texture, in this paper, an algorithm composed of a positive sample generation scheme, dynamic and directional grids, a large feature set generation scheme, and partial least squares regression has been proposed. More than 6300 inner forearm and thigh images collected from a laboratory environment and from the internet with large pose, viewpoint, and illumination variations were employed in this paper. The proposed algorithm was compared with the state-of-the-art texture recognition methods, and skin texture was compared with blood vessels, a hard biometric trait, extracted from color and infrared images. The results showed that the proposed algorithm performed significantly better than did the texture recognition methods, and skin texture outperformed blood vessels in all of the experiments, achieving encouraging performance.},

abstract={Smart devices equipped with powerful sensing, computing and networking capabilities have proliferated lately, ranging from popular smartphones and tablets to Internet appliances, smart TVs, and others that will soon appear (e.g., watches, glasses, and clothes). One key feature of such devices is their ability to incorporate third-party apps from a variety of markets. This poses strong security and privacy issues to users and infrastructure operators, particularly through software of malicious (or dubious) nature that can easily get access to the services provided by the device and collect sensory data and personal information. Malware in current smart devices -mostly smartphones and tablets- have rocketed in the last few years, in some cases supported by sophisticated techniques purposely designed to overcome security architectures currently in use by such devices. Even though important advances have been made on malware detection in traditional personal computers during the last decades, adopting and adapting those techniques to smart devices is a challenging problem. For example, power consumption is one major constraint that makes unaffordable to run traditional detection engines on the device, while externalized (i.e., cloud-based) techniques rise many privacy concerns. This article examines the problem of malware in smart devices and recent progress made in detection techniques. We first present a detailed analysis on how malware has evolved over the last years for the most popular platforms. We identify exhibited behaviors, pursued goals, infection and distribution strategies, etc. and provide numerous examples through case studies of the most relevant specimens. We next survey, classify and discuss efforts made on detecting both malware and other suspicious software (grayware), concentrating on the 20 most relevant techniques proposed between 2010 and 2013. Based on the conclusions extracted from this study, we finally provide constructive discussion on open research problems and areas where we believe that more work is needed.},

DDoS attacks are difficult to trace back to actual attackers, can lead to catastrophic service loss, and are launched with ease, making them one of the most dangerous attacks. This research simulates an Internet of Things network in-home setting of 100 nodes using OMNeT++ simulation tool, including a DDoS attack. Regular and attack-injected traffic is generated to evaluate the accuracy of detecting DDoS attacks in IoT networks using machine learning technqiues. A new IoT Dataset called IoT Dat is generated with different scenarios of normal traffic and traffic with attacks of different intensities of 5, 10, and 20. The authors will make this dataset publicly available. Moreover, machine learning techniques are used to assess the efficiency of attack detection.},

abstract={A wireless sensor network (WSN) is generally deployed in an uncontrolled environment where it can be the target of many security attacks trying to compromise its normal operation. Consequently, providing security for data exchanged in a WSN is one of the main requirements to allow the accomplishment of its mission. This paper, proposes a location-aware key authentication and distribution mechanism to secure WSNs where the key establishment is performed using elliptic curve cryptography and identity-based public key scheme. In this scheme, public key authentication is based on the position of the sensor node in the monitored area. Before establishing a pairwise key between two nodes, each one of them must verify the neighborhood location of the other node using a message authentication code calculated on the corresponding public key using keys derived from encrypted beacons broadcast by anchor nodes. We show that the proposed public key authentication and distribution scheme is more resilient to node replication attack and generates less communication overhead than currently available location dependent schemes.},

However, security and privacy issues of VR are rarely investigated. In this paper, we introduce novel computer vision-based and motion sensor-based side channel attacks to infer keystrokes in a virtual environment. In the computer vision-based attack, a stereo camera records a user maneuvering a pointing device and inputting passwords. Various computer vision techniques are used to detect the touching frames in which the user taps a touchpad to enter keys on the virtual keyboard within the VE. We then estimate the pose of the headset and derive the orientation of the virtual pointing ray in each touching frame. In the motion sensor-based attack, we exploit sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer built inside the pointing device to retrieve orientation angles of the pointing device. With orientation angles of the pointing device, we can derive the empirical rotation angles and infer the clicked keys by assessing the similarity between the empirical rotation angles and the reference ones between keys. Extensive real-world experiments are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these side channel attacks.},

abstract={This paper presents an exploratory machine learning attack based on deep learning to infer the functionality of an arbitrary classifier by polling it as a black box, and using returned labels to build a functionally equivalent machine. Typically, it is costly and time consuming to build a classifier, because this requires collecting training data (e.g., through crowdsourcing), selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm (through extensive tests and using domain-specific knowledge), and optimizing the underlying hyperparameters (applying a good understanding of the classifier's structure). In addition, all this information is typically proprietary and should be protected. With the proposed black-box attack approach, an adversary can use deep learning to reliably infer the necessary information by using labels previously obtained from the classifier under attack, and build a functionally equivalent machine learning classifier without knowing the type, structure or underlying parameters of the original classifier. Results for a text classification application demonstrate that deep learning can infer Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers with high accuracy and steal their functionalities. This new attack paradigm with deep learning introduces additional security challenges for online machine learning algorithms and raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to counteract the high fidelity inference capability of deep learning.},

abstract={A botnet is a collection of computers in co-ordinated way to perform certain malicious activity. Recently, Botnet have become one of the most critical challenges. Every day botnet developed new evasion techniques to make their presence undetectable. So there should be a comparison of such botnet detection methodologies which needs more examination to show their efficiency and appropriateness for detecting malicious attacks. Although there are many different detection techniques have been developed still there are some challenges in detection technique to find out parameters in botnet attack. So there must be focus on developing more secure authenticated and reliable detection methods for botnet attack. The main aim of this paper is to provide an overview of botnet, its categories, detection techniques and analysis. By using this study researchers will able to work with efficient detection technique for further research in this particular area.},

abstract={Selective hearing (SH) refers to the listeners' capability to focus their attention on a specific sound source or a group of sound sources in their auditory scene. This in turn implies that the listeners' focus is minimized for sources that are of no interest. This paper describes the current landscape of machine listening research, and outlines ways in which these technologies can be leveraged to achieve SH with computational means. To do so, a brief overview of the state-of-the-art in the fields of detection, classification, separation, localization and enhancement of sound sources is presented, highlighting recent advances in each field, and drawing connections between them. Two main challenges lie ahead in the development of SH applications: (1) Unified methods that can jointly detect/classify/localize and separate/enhance sound sources are required to provide both the flexibility and robustness required for real-life SH. (2) Low-latency methods suitable for real-time performance are critical when dealing with the dynamic nature of real-life auditory scenes.},

abstract={With information becoming a first-class citizen on the Internet, information-centric networking (ICN) is considered as a promising direction for the future Internet. Named data networking (NDN) is a prominent example of emerging ICN architectures. Unfortunately, NDN is vulnerable to various attacks targeting its in-network caching mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the false-locality pollution attack, in which an adversary repeatedly requests a number of unpopular data objects to waste the precious cache space on the NDN router and to reduce normal users' hit ratios. With simulation experiments, we show that such an attack can cause considerable damage to the NDN network. To detect and mitigate such an attack, we introduce an algorithm that exploits the diversity of the Interest traversing paths within an Internet service provider's point-of-presence network. We also propose inexpensive methodologies based on the probabilistic counting and Bloom filter techniques to implement the algorithm on an NDN router. The experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm is effective in thwarting false-locality pollution. We also experiment with strategies that the adversary may utilize against our antipollution algorithm and demonstrate that such strategies are either ineffective or impractical in the real world.},

abstract={Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Cognitive Radio (CR) are promising technologies, which can be used to alleviate the spectrum shortage problem or the barriers to communication interoperability in various application domains. The successful deployment of SDR and CR technologies will depend on the design and implementation of essential security mechanisms to ensure the robustness of networks and terminals against security attacks. SDR and CR may introduce entirely new classes of security threats and challenges including download of malicious software, licensed user emulation and selfish misbehaviors. An attacker could disrupt the basic functions of a CR network, cause harmful interference to licensed users or deny communication to other CR nodes. The research activity in this area has started only recently and many challenges are still to be resolved. This paper presents a survey of security aspects in SDR and CR. We identify the requirements for the deployment of SDR and CR, the main security threats and challenges and the related protection techniques. This paper provides an overview of the SDR and CR certification process and how it is related to the security aspects. Finally, this paper summarizes the most critical challenges in the context of the future evolution of SDR/CR technologies.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining increasing popularity. Overwhelming volumes of data are generated by IoT devices. Those data after analytics provide significant information that could greatly benefit IoT applications. Different from traditional applications, IoT applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart navigation, and smart healthcare come with new requirements, such as mobility, real-time response, and location awareness. However, traditional cloud computing paradigm cannot satisfy these demands due to centralized processing and being far away from local devices. Hence, edge computing was introduced to perform data processing and storage in the edge of networks, which is closer to data sources than cloud computing, thus efficient and location-aware. Unfortunately, edge computing brings new security and privacy challenges when applied to data analytics. The literature still lacks a thorough review on the recent advances in secure data analytics in edge computing. In this paper, we first introduce the concept and features of edge computing, and then propose a number of requirements for its secure data analytics by analyzing potential security threats in edge computing. Furthermore, we give a comprehensive review on the pros and cons of the existing works on data analytics in edge computing based on our proposed requirements. Based on our literature survey, we highlight current open issues and propose future research directions.},

pages={1-9},
abstract={In many applications such as sensor networks, e-healthcare and environmental monitoring, data is continuously streamed and combined from multiple resources in order to make decisions based on the aggregated data streams. One major concern in these applications is assuring high trustworthiness of the aggregated data stream for correct decision-making. For example, an adversary may compromise a few data-sources and introduce false data into the aggregated data-stream and cause catastrophic consequences. In this work, we propose a novel method for verifying data integrity by embedding several signature codes within data streams known as digital watermarking. Therefore, the integrity of the data streams can be verified by decoding the embedded signatures even as the data go through multiple stages of aggregation process. Although the idea of secure data aggregation based on digital watermarking has been explored before, we aim to improve the efficiency of the scheme by examining several signature codes that could also decrease the watermark detection complexity. This is achieved by simultaneous embedding of several shifted watermark patterns into aggregated data stream, such that the contribution of each data-source is hidden in the relative shifts of the patterns. We, also, derive conditions to preserve the main statistical properties of data-streams prior to the embedding procedure. Therefore, we can guarantee that the embedding procedure does not compromise the usability of data streams for any operations that depends on these statistical characteristics. The simulation results show that the embedded watermarks can successfully be recovered with high confidence if proper hiding codes are chosen.},

The multiculture network design is formalized using two sequential optimization problems: The first one for optimally selecting the number of network devices from each available vendor at the design stage, and the second one for optimally placing the devices in the network topology. Results show the capability of multiculture design in improving network reliability of eight actual topologies.},

Similar to LTE, the 5G NR physical layer consists of several physical channels and signals, most of which are vital to the operation of the network. Unfortunately, like for any wireless technology, disruption through radio jamming is possible. This paper investigates the extent to which 5G NR is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing, by analyzing the physical downlink and uplink control channels and signals. We identify the weakest links in the 5G NR frame, and propose mitigation strategies that should be taken into account during implementation of 5G NR chipsets and base stations.},

abstract={The increasing use of mobile devices has triggered the development of location based services (LBS). By providing location information to LBS, mobile users can enjoy variety of useful applications utilizing location information, but might suffer the troubles of private information leakage. Location information of mobile users needs to be kept secret while maintaining utility to achieve desirable service quality. Existing location privacy enhancing techniques based on K-anonymity and Hilbertcurve cloaking area generation showed advantages in privacy protection and service quality but disadvantages due to the generation of large cloaking areas that makes query processing and communication less effective. In this paper we propose a novel location privacy preserving scheme that leverages some differential privacy based notions and mechanisms to publish the optimal size cloaking areas from multiple rotated and shifted versions of Hilbert curve. With experimental results, we show that our scheme significantly reduces the average size of cloaking areas compared to previous Hilbert curve method. We also show how to quantify adversary's ability to perform an inference attack on user location data and how to limit adversary's success rate under a designed threshold.},

abstract={Providing connectivity to around half of the world population living in rural or underprivileged areas is a tremendous challenge, but, at the same time, a unique opportunity. Access to the Internet would provide the population living in these areas a possibility to progress on the educational, health, environment, and business levels. In this article, a survey of technologies for providing connectivity to rural areas, which can help address this challenge, is provided. Although access/fronthaul and backhaul techniques are discussed in this article, it is noted that the major limitation for providing connectivity to rural and underprivileged areas is the cost of backhaul deployment. In addition, energy requirements and cost-efficiency of the studied technologies are analyzed. In fact, the challenges faced for deploying an electricity network, as a prerequisite for deploying communication networks, are huge in these areas, and they are granted an important share of the discussions in this article. Furthermore, typical application scenarios in rural areas are discussed, and several country-specific use cases are surveyed. The main initiatives by key international players aiming to provide rural connectivity are also described. Moreover, directions for the future evolution of rural connectivity are outlined in this article. Although there is no single solution that can solve all rural connectivity problems, building gradually on the current achievements in order to reach ubiquitous connectivity, while taking into account the particularities of each region and tailoring the solution accordingly, seems to be the most suitable path to follow.},

abstract={Botnets have long been used for malicious purposes with huge economic costs to the society. With the proliferation of cheap but non-secure Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generating large amounts of data, the potential for damage from botnets has increased manifold. There are several approaches to detect bots or botnets, though many traditional techniques are becoming less effective as botnets with centralized command & control structure are being replaced by peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets which are harder to detect. Several algorithms have been proposed in literature that use graph analysis or machine learning techniques to detect the overlay structure of P2P networks in communication graphs. Many of these algorithms however, depend on the availability of a universal communication graph or a communication graph aggregated from several ISPs, which is not likely to be available in reality. In real world deployments, significant gaps in communication graphs are expected and any solution proposed should be able to work with partial information. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of some community detection algorithms in detecting P2P botnets, especially with partial information. We show that the approach can work with only about half of the nodes reporting their communication graphs, with only small increase in detection errors.},

abstract={Effective defense of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks remains a challenging problem, especially under powerful white-box attacks. In this paper, we develop a new method called ensemble generative cleaning with feedback loops (EGC-FL) for effective defense of deep neural networks. The proposed EGC-FL method is based on two central ideas. First, we introduce a transformed deadzone layer into the defense network, which consists of an orthonormal transform and a deadzone-based activation function, to destroy the sophisticated noise pattern of adversarial attacks. Second, by constructing a generative cleaning network with a feedback loop, we are able to generate an ensemble of diverse estimations of the original clean image. We then learn a network to fuse this set of diverse estimations together to restore the original image. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the state-of-art by large margins in both white-box and black-box attacks. It significantly improves the classification accuracy for white-box PGD attacks upon the second best method by more than 29% on the SVHN dataset and more than 39% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset.},

Everyone wants to keep their data or information safe from theft or from being corrupted. In this paper we discuss about a hybrid technique to implement data security in communication. The techniques used include watermarking and cryptography. This encryption and decryption techniques can be used for image, video, audio, and text. In this paper we have used image as the data for encryption and decryption. This paper illustrates the use of the Secure Force (SF) algorithm for encryption and decryption process. The simulation work has being carried out using MATLAB. Various parameters like PSNR, MSE and Entropy was also calculated.},

abstract={The crisis of insecure software has resulted in a drastic increase in the frequency and impact of cyber attacks on businesses and individual users alike. The discipline of secure software engineering has evolved as a response to this trend, with the aim of producing software with fewer coding bugs or design flaws that result in exploitable vulnerabilities. However, secure software engineering is a young discipline, and many software artifacts in current use were created before, or in ignorance of, its development. Software practitioners would benefit greatly from a rigorous methodology for analyzing and validating software that has already entered its maintenance lifecycle. In this paper, we present a combined penetrating testing methodology that incorporates strengths of several existing approaches, with the goal to understand their utility and benefit for analyzing security of existing software programs. We exercise this methodology through a case study applied to a popular tool used by many network security practitioners: Wireshark. As a contribution, our study illustrates the benefits of a combined approach and outlines recommendations for a holistic method that will improve security-based risk assessment. Specifically, we show how application of rigorous test-driven threat modeling can produce better abuse cases, which can in turn be used to inform and more precisely define penetration testing activities.},

The increased deployment of IoT devices into diverse areas of our life has provided us with significant benefits such as improved quality of life and task automation. However, each time a new IoT device is deployed, new and unique security threats emerge or are introduced into the environment under which the device must operate. Instantaneous detection and mitigation of every security threat introduced by different IoT devices deployed can be very challenging. This is because many of the IoT devices are manufactured with no consideration of their security implications. In this paper therefore, we review existing literature and present IoT threat detection research advances with a focus on the various IoT security challenges as well as the current developments towards combating cyber security threats in IoT networks. However, this paper also highlights several future research directions in the IoT domain.},

abstract={The well known game Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) is examined as a test case for a new algorithm of genetic search known as Multiple Agent Genetic Networks (MAGnet). MAGnet facilitates the movement of not just the agents, but also the problem instances which a population of agents is working to solve in parallel. This allows for simultaneous classification of problem instances and search for solution to those problems. As this is an initial study, there is a focus on the ability of MAGnet to classify problem instances of IPD playing agents. A problem instance of IPD is a single opponent. A good classification method, called fingerprinting, for IPD exists and allows for verification of the comparison. Results found by MAGnet are shown to be logical classifications of the problems based upon player strategy. A subpopulation collapse effect is shown which allows the location of both difficult problem instances and the existence of general solutions to a problem.},

abstract={Semi-fragile watermarking methods are mainly characterized by their robustness against unintentional attacks such as regular image processing and their fragility against intentional attacks aiming to alter signal contents. Thus, these methods need to provide correct robustness and fragility. However, numerous factors impede the achievement of these two objectives. The fact that the watermark is not dependent on the content of the image (the medium considered in this study) and also the semi-fragile method is not block-wise dependent, make the method vulnerable to intentional attacks. Recently, an image authentication method has been proposed, which despite the use of a secret key in generating the watermark, suffers from the preceding vulnerabilities. Thus, in this paper we aim to present a counterfeiting attack and demonstrate that the method is not even fragile against complete counterfeiting, making it incapable of detecting image tampering. Essentially, the proposed attack enables the attacker to counterfeit the watermarks belonging to any number of 4×4 blocks and embed them in arbitrary blocks. The results indicate that the proposed attack successfully deceives the method.},

abstract={A number of detection and defense mechanisms have emerged in the last decade to tackle the botnet phenomenon. It is important to organize this knowledge to better understand the botnet problem and its solution space. In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches. To provide real-world context, we liberally augment our discussions with relevant examples from security research and products.},

abstract={Attacks capable of removing SIFT keypoints from images have been recently devised with the intention of compromising the correct functioning of SIFT-based copy-move forgery detection. To tackle with these attacks, we propose three novel forensic detectors for the identification of images whose SIFT keypoints have been globally or locally removed. The detectors look for inconsistencies like the absence or anomalous distribution of keypoints within textured image regions. We first validate the methods on state-of-the-art keypoint removal techniques, then we further assess their robustness by devising a counter-forensic attack injecting fake SIFT keypoints in the attempt to cover the traces of removal. We apply the detectors to a practical image forensic scenario of SIFT-based copy-move forgery detection, assuming the presence of a counterfeiter who resorts to keypoint removal and injection to create copy-move forgeries that successfully elude SIFT-based detectors but are in turn exposed by the newly proposed tools.},

abstract={BitTorrent is the most widely used Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol and it comprises the largest share of traffic in Europe. To make BitTorrent more Internet Service Provider (ISP) friendly, BitTorrent Inc. invented the Micro Transport Protocol (uTP). It is based on UDP with a novel congestion control called Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT). This protocol assumes that the receiver always gives correct feedback, since otherwise this deteriorates throughput or yields to corrupted data. We show through experimental investigation that a misbehaving uTP receiver, which is not interested in data integrity, can increase the bandwidth of the sender by up to five times. This can cause a congestion collapse and steal large share of a victim's bandwidth. We present three attacks, which increase the bandwidth usage significantly. We have tested these attacks in a real world environment and show its severity both in terms of number of packets and total traffic generated. We also present a countermeasure for protecting against the attacks and evaluate the performance of that defence strategy.},

Significant efforts are, therefore, being deployed to detect synthetically-generated content. One popular forensic approach trains a neural network to distinguish real from synthetic content.We show that such forensic classifiers are vulnerable to a range of attacks that reduce the classifier to near- 0% accuracy. We develop five attack case studies on a state- of-the-art classifier that achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.95 on almost all existing image generators, when only trained on one generator. With full access to the classifier, we can flip the lowest bit of each pixel in an image to reduce the classifier's AUC to 0.0005; perturb 1% of the image area to reduce the classifier's AUC to 0.08; or add a single noise pattern in the synthesizer's latent space to reduce the classifier's AUC to 0.17. We also develop a black-box attack that, with no access to the target classifier, reduces the AUC to 0.22. These attacks reveal significant vulnerabilities of certain image-forensic classifiers.},

This attack is memory independent and survives data wipes and factory resets. We evaluate two phones from major vendors and present a proof-of-concept attack in actual hardware on one phone and an emulation level attack on the other. Through a semi-automated source code review of 26 recent Android phones from 8 different vendors, we believe that ourattack vector can be applied to many other phones, and that it is very difficult to protect against. Similar attacks should also be possible on other smart devices such as printers, cameras and cars, which similarly contain user-replaceable sub-units.},

abstract={Current era of networking world witnesses an increase in the number of devices that have intelligent component embedded in them, which leads to an unmanageable state. This has lead to a steady shift towards using Open Software Defined Networks to reduce operational expenditure. The whole of the intelligence lies in the central controller which obviously is the single point of failure. The attackers find it easy to bring down the whole network by saturating the control plane of the SDN which eventually leads to denial-of-service (DoS) to the data plane, through host location hijacking attack. The various strategies proposed to defend the SDN controller from host location hijack attack includes authentication of host which incurs overhead. In this paper we propose SLAMHHA, a Supervised Learning Approach to Mitigate Host location Hijacking Attack. SLAMHHA is implemented in the SDN controller which monitors the legitimacy of the hosts and identifies the clandestine users impersonating the hosts in the data plane. The SLAMHHA algorithm can be implemented in either of the two SDN controller setup (i.e.) in both centralized and decentralized controller setup, been used to set the flow rules and monitor the underlying network. MININET has been used to test the efficiency of the SLAMHHA algorithm. SLAMHHA algorithm was implemented in the POX controller. Numerical results show that SLAMHHA incurs less overhead in terms of CPU and memory consumption when compared to the authentication method. This algorithm blocks the attack within 3 seconds when 100 hosts are impersonated to perform DoS attack. Thus our proposed SLAMHHA algorithm mitigates the host location hijacking attack with less overhead.},

abstract={Fog-cloud computing promises many new vertical service areas beyond simple data communication, storing, and processing. Among them, distributed deep learning (DDL) across fog-cloud computing environment is one of the most popular applications due to its high efficiency and scalability. Compared with the centralized deep learning, DDL can provide better privacy protection with training only on sharing parameters. Nevertheless, when DDL meets fog-cloud computing, it still faces two major security challenges: 1) how to protect users' privacy from being leaked to other internal participants in the training process and 2) how to guarantee users' identities from being forged by external adversaries. To combat them, several approaches have been proposed via various technologies. Nevertheless, those approaches suffer from drawbacks in terms of security, efficiency, and functionality, and cannot guarantee the legitimacy of participants' identities during training. In this article, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving DDL (SPDDL) for fog-cloud computing. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, our proposal achieves a better tradeoff between security, efficiency, and functionality. In addition, our SPDDL can guarantee the unforgeability of users' identities against external adversaries. Extensive experimental results indicate the practical feasibility and high efficiency of our SPDDL.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of numerous small nodes that can sense, collect, and disseminate information for many different types of applications. One of these applications is subject tracking and monitoring, in which the monitored subjects often need protection. For instance, a WSN can be deployed to monitor the movement of a panda in a national park. The panda needs protection from different adversaries, such as hunters and poachers. An adversary might trace the messages in the WSN to find the source node that sensed the panda, with the final aim of killing the panda. Hence the question is: how do we hide the location of the source node from the adversary? This question is relevant in several of the scenarios related to this application, such as patient monitoring and battlefield surveillance. In other words, the problem is to provide privacy to the source node: source location privacy. In this paper, we provide a survey of the state of the art in source location privacy. We first discuss the key concepts in source location privacy, such as anonymity, unobservability, safety period, and capture likelihood. Then, we present an overview of the solutions that provide source location privacy within a WSN, in relation to the assumptions about the adversary's capabilities. In particular, we summarize the concepts and solutions, which are categorized based on the core techniques used to provide source location privacy. We mention the limitations of the algorithms as found in the literature, classify the solutions based on their approach, and provide an overview of the assumptions on the adversarial capabilities related to each solution.},

The scheme we present allows for tracking of unknown rotationally symmetric objects and is based on a robust technique for estimating the axis of these objects adapted from a previous work. Aditionally we use template matching to track previously known objects. For grasping, a trajectory is planned for the gripper that chases the object and is able to synchronize to the object's motion, allowing it to lift the object from the conveyor.},

Cloud Computing technology has witnessed significant advances in its implementation and become widely adopted by either private or public sectors. It was obvious recently that a lot of organizations and enterprises are transferring their workloads to the cloud. However, security is a major concern for the cloud computing services which is based on Internet connection that makes it vulnerable to multiple types of attacks. Even though that the security measures implemented over cloud computing are developing every passing year, Security still a challenge.

abstract={The Internet of Things is characterized by the large-scale deployment of low power and lossy networks (LLN), interconnecting pervasive objects. The routing protocol for LLN (RPL) protocol has been standardized by IETF to enable a lightweight and robust routing in these constrained networks. A versioning mechanism is incorporated into RPL in order to maintain an optimized topology. However, an attacker can exploit this mechanism to significantly damage the network and reduce its lifetime. After analyzing and comparing existing work, we propose in this paper a monitoring strategy with dedicated algorithms for detecting such attacks and identifying the involved malicious nodes. The performance of this solution is evaluated through extensive experiments, and its scalability is quantified with the support of a monitoring node placement optimization method.},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are collection of large number of sensor nodes that are used for essential monitoring purposes. They include many applications such as military and security applications, elementary monitoring, seismic monitoring, industrialized automation, wellness and robust monitoring etc. Due to its distributed nature and interconnected network approach, they are considered common target among attackers. WSNs are unprotected due to many attacks like illegal access, malicious node attack, wormhole attack, jamming attack, insider attack, cloning attack, routing attack and node capturing attack etc. Node capturing attack leads to node replication attack which is considered dangerous because after capturing node, attacker may extract all the encrypted information and further introduce many insider attacks. In node replication attack, attacker tries to capture the sensor node and if he becomes successful then he generates the replica which appears to be genuine. This paper reviews the various types of identification schemes and protocols contrary to replication attack.},

pages={450-465},
abstract={We analyze the security vulnerabilities of PEAS, ASCENT, and CCP, three well-known topology maintenance protocols (TMPs) for sensor networks. These protocols aim to increase the lifetime of the sensor network by only maintaining a subset of nodes in an active or awake state. The design of these protocols assumes that the sensor nodes will be deployed in a trusted, nonadversarial environment, and does not take into account the impact of attacks launched by malicious insider or outsider nodes. We propose a metaprotocol (Meta-TMP) to represent the class of topology maintenance protocols. The Meta-TMP provides us with a better understanding of the characteristics and of how a specific TMP works, and it can be used to study the vulnerabilities of a specific TMP. We describe various types of malicious behavior and actions that can be carried out by an adversary to attack a wireless sensor network by exploiting the TMP being used in the network. We describe three attacks against these protocols that may be used to reduce the lifetime of the sensor network, or to degrade the functionality of the sensor application by reducing the network connectivity and the sensing coverage that can be achieved. Further, we describe countermeasures that can be taken to increase the robustness of the protocols and make them resilient to such attacks.},

abstract={There are sophisticated cyber attacks that pose a high risk to institutions, especially when they are carefully planned and victims are unable to identify them. This is a preliminary result of executing the high-level cyber threat hunting through automated hypothesis-making and multi-criteria decision making using the binary attack-chaining tables identified in the networks. Firstly, the concepts required for threats modeling and the process of knowledge discovery in databases focused on high-level threat hunting were introduced. After, the knowledge discovered was used in an experiment that applied and evaluated the effectiveness of machine learning and decision-making algorithms in the method proposed to prioritize hypotheses in the screening phase. In addition, an automated hypothesis-making method to be used in production environments was also proposed. Finally, the results achieved in the experiment demonstrated that high-level threat hunting is a viable and more efficient alternative compared to manual process.},

abstract={Information centric networking (ICN) and software-defined networking (SDN) are two emerging networking paradigms that promise to solve different aspects of networking problems. ICN is a clean-slate design for accommodating the ever increasing growth of the Internet traffic by regarding content as the network primitive, adopting in-network caching, and name-based routing, while SDN focuses on agile and flexible network management by decoupling network control logic from data forwarding. ICN and SDN have gained significant research attention separately in the most of the previous work. However, the features of ICN have profound impacts on the design and operation of SDN, such as in-network caching and data-centric security. Conversely, SDN provides a powerful tool for experimenting and deploying ICN architectures and can greatly facilitate ICN functionality and management. In this paper, we point out the necessity of surveying the scattered works on integrating SDN and ICN (SD-ICN) for improving operational networks. Specifically, we analyze the points of SD-ICN strengths and opportunities, and discuss the SDN enablers for deploying ICN architectures. In addition, we review and classify the recent work on improving the network management by SD-ICN and discuss the potential security benefits of SD-ICN. Finally, a number of open issues and future trends are highlighted.},

abstract={Scaling up fine-grained recognition to all domains of fine-grained objects is a challenge the computer vision community will need to face in order to realize its goal of recognizing all object categories. Current state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily upon the use of keypoint or part annotations, but scaling up to hundreds or thousands of domains renders this annotation cost-prohibitive for all but the most important categories. In this work we propose a method for fine-grained recognition that uses no part annotations. Our method is based on generating parts using co-segmentation and alignment, which we combine in a discriminative mixture. Experimental results show its efficacy, demonstrating state-of-the-art results even when compared to methods that use part annotations during training.},

abstract={We present the first Internet architecture designed to provide route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communications. SCION separates ASes into groups of independent routing sub-planes, called trust domains, which then interconnect to form complete routes. Trust domains provide natural isolation of routing failures and human misconfiguration, give endpoints strong control for both inbound and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates with high path freshness. As a result, our architecture provides strong resilience and security properties as an intrinsic consequence of good design principles, avoiding piecemeal add-on protocols as security patches. Meanwhile, SCION only assumes that a few top-tier ISPs in the trust domain are trusted for providing reliable end-to-end communications, thus achieving a small Trusted Computing Base. Both our security analysis and evaluation results show that SCION naturally prevents numerous attacks and provides a high level of resilience, scalability, control, and isolation.},

The benefits of this relationship include free web browsers with powerful search engines and mobile applications. Still, it turns out that “free” comes at a cost that is paid through our interactions within a digital advertising ecosystem. Digital advertising is not without its challenges. Issues originate from the complex platforms utilized to support advertising over web and mobile application interfaces. This is especially true for advertising links. Additionally, as new methods for advertising develop so too does the potential for impacting its underlying ecosystem for good or ill. Accordingly, researchers are interested in understanding this ecosystem, the factors that impact it, and the strategies for improving it. The major contribution of this survey is that it is the first review of the digital advertising ecosystem as it applies to online websites and mobile applications. In doing so, we explain the digital advertising relationships within this ecosystem along with their technical, social, political, and physical implications. Furthermore, advertising principles along with a variation of other advertising approaches, both legitimate and malicious, are explored in order to compare and contrast competing digital advertising methods.},

Then, the DWT is applied on the secondary image using the various mother wavelets, to generate a final hash value. The perceptual hash was used to index and retrieve near-identical images from the database. The precision-recall curves are used to evaluate the performance of the application. The experiments shows that the proposed hashing algorithm is robust against content-preserving operations like image rotation, image scaling, Gaussian low-pass filtering, JPEG compression, brightness adjustment, and gamma correction.},

abstract={It is a challenging issue in smart grid to provide flexible and efficient data aggregation and at the same time maintain data integrity and data privacy. To address this issue, we firstly propose a lightweight $t$ -times homomorphic encryption scheme, which can reduce the computational cost of smart devices further and resist quantum attacks. Based on it, we propose two efficient data aggregation schemes for two application scenarios. The first scheme is suitable for small network, such as home network and small-office network. The second scheme is appropriate for medium-size network, such as a part of smart city. More specifically, we explore how the number of smart devices and the number of home area networks affect the overhead of communication and computation. The experiment results show that the proposed schemes are efficient. Moreover, the proposed schemes not only meet security requirements of integrity, confidentiality, authenticity, resistance to intermediate attack, resistance to replay attack, forward and backward security and resistance to quantum attack, but also reduce the overhead of communication and computation.},

abstract={We consider the setting of HTTP traffic over encrypted tunnels, as used to conceal the identity of websites visited by a user. It is well known that traffic analysis (TA) attacks can accurately identify the website a user visits despite the use of encryption, and previous work has looked at specific attack/countermeasure pairings. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of general-purpose TA countermeasures. We show that nine known countermeasures are vulnerable to simple attacks that exploit coarse features of traffic (e.g., total time and bandwidth). The considered countermeasures include ones like those standardized by TLS, SSH, and IPsec, and even more complex ones like the traffic morphing scheme of Wright et al. As just one of our results, we show that despite the use of traffic morphing, one can use only total upstream and downstream bandwidth to identify -- with 98% accuracy - which of two websites was visited. One implication of what we find is that, in the context of website identification, it is unlikely that bandwidth-efficient, general-purpose TA countermeasures can ever provide the type of security targeted in prior work.},

abstract={In many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), providing end to end secure communications between sensors and the sink is important for secure network management. While there have been many works devoted to hop by hop secure communications, the issue of end to end secure communications is largely ignored. In this paper, we design an end to end secure communication protocol in randomly deployed WSNs. Specifically, our protocol is based on a methodology called differentiated key pre-distribution. The core idea is to distribute different number of keys to different sensors to enhance the resilience of certain links. This feature is leveraged during routing, where nodes route through those links with higher resilience. Using rigorous theoretical analysis, we derive an expression for the quality of end to end secure communications, and use it to determine optimum protocol parameters. Extensive performance evaluation illustrates that our solutions can provide highly secure communications between sensor nodes and the sink in randomly deployed WSNs. We also provide detailed discussion on a potential attack (i.e. biased node capturing attack) to our solutions, and propose several countermeasures to this attack.},

abstract={With expectation of widespread adoption of Connected Vehicles Technology (CVT), security within the vehicular networks has come under scrutiny. Owing to the nature of CVT applications, security flaws can result not only in loss of data or network function but also in fatal accidents. Security mechanisms that can account for privacy, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation while having an acceptable communication overhead are imperative to the functioning of CVT applications. While this field of study is rapidly evolving with a wide range of studies and security solutions being proposed for different areas of CVT security, literature documenting the comprehensive picture of current security protocols and practices is missing. This paper attempts to remedy this by documenting recent advances in CVT security with the goal of providing an efficient jumping off point for future research in CVT security development.},

abstract={Ultrasound-guided medical interventions are broadly applied in diagnostics and therapy, e.g., regional anesthesia or ablation. A guided intervention using 2-D ultrasound is challenging due to the poor instrument visibility, limited field of view, and the multi-fold coordination of the medical instrument and ultrasound plane. Recent 3-D ultrasound transducers can improve the quality of the image-guided intervention if an automated detection of the needle is used. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting medical instruments in 3-D ultrasound data that is solely based on image processing techniques and validated on various ex vivo and in vivo data sets. In the proposed procedure, the physician is placing the 3-D transducer at the desired position, and the image processing will automatically detect the best instrument view, so that the physician can entirely focus on the intervention. Our method is based on the classification of instrument voxels using volumetric structure directions and robust approximation of the primary tool axis. A novel normalization method is proposed for the shape and intensity consistency of instruments to improve the detection. Moreover, a novel 3-D Gabor wavelet transformation is introduced and optimally designed for revealing the instrument voxels in the volume, while remaining generic to several medical instruments and transducer types. Experiments on diverse data sets, including in vivo data from patients, show that for a given transducer and an instrument type, high detection accuracies are achieved with position errors smaller than the instrument diameter in the 0.5-1.5-mm range on average.},

abstract={SQL Injection vulnerabilities still exist even after almost two decades that it first appeared. In spite of numerous prevention methodologies being used today, web applications still tend to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Technology has improved drastically over the past few years and computers have certainly brought a great impact on our lifestyle. The computer applications and their usage over the web are myriad. It is quite evident that the in the near future, the usage of computers would relatively be higher than what we are witnessing today. A wide variety of data such as credit information, military data, human communication data, and countless types of data is shared over the far-flung computer networks. As the usage and reliability on computers increase, the threat to sensitive data likewise increases. The challenges with the cyber security when dealing with sensitive information is now a nightmare. To help understand the threats and the severity of exploits deployed, the paper provides proof of concepts for exploits carried out to compromise web applications and how the databases are exploited using the SQL injection methodologies. The SQL injection vulnerabilities in the web applications are surprisingly very vast and this is definitely is a huge security threat to personal data of people that is stored on web. In this paper, the methods used in information gathering, how the security is breached, and how payloads are used to exploit web applications are explained using the Kali Linux. In addition, an analysis is carried out on how the websites are comprised. Advanced methods on how to defend SQL injections are briefly justified. For the readers to understand better, a real time scenario of a penetration tester and a database server is set up with a few suppositions, and the commands that dodge the security characteristics and manipulate the databases are explicated.},

The survey consists of four segments. The first segment will explore the most relevant limitations of IoT devices and their solutions. The second one will present the classification of IoT attacks.

abstract={Due to the popularity of mobile computing and mobile sensing, users' traces can now be readily collected to enhance applications' performance. However, users' location privacy may be disclosed to the untrusted data aggregator that collects users' traces. Cloaking users' traces with synthetic traces is a prevalent technique to protect location privacy. But the existing work that synthesizes traces suffers from the social relationship based de-anonymization attacks. To this end, we propose W3-tess that synthesizes privacy-preserving traces via enhancing the plausibility of synthetic traces with social networks. The main idea of W3-tess is to credibly imitate the temporal, spatial, and social behavior of users' mobility, sample the traces that exhibit similar three-dimension mobility behavior, and synthesize traces using the sampled locations. By doing so, W3-tess can provide “differential privacy” on location privacy preservation. In addition, compared to the existing work, W3-tess offers several salient features. First, both location privacy preservation and data utility guarantees are theoretically provable. Second, it is applicable to most geo-data analysis tasks performed by the data aggregator. Experiments on two real-world datasets, loc-Gwalla and loc-Brightkite, have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of W3-tess.},

abstract={With the rapid progress in recent years, techniques that generate and manipulate multimedia content can now provide a very advanced level of realism. The boundary between real and synthetic media has become very thin. On the one hand, this opens the door to a series of exciting applications in different fields such as creative arts, advertising, film production, and video games. On the other hand, it poses enormous security threats. Software packages freely available on the web allow any individual, without special skills, to create very realistic fake images and videos. These can be used to manipulate public opinion during elections, commit fraud, discredit or blackmail people. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automated tools capable of detecting false multimedia content and avoiding the spread of dangerous false information. This review paper aims to present an analysis of the methods for visual media integrity verification, that is, the detection of manipulated images and videos. Special emphasis will be placed on the emerging phenomenon of deepfakes, fake media created through deep learning tools, and on modern data-driven forensic methods to fight them. The analysis will help highlight the limits of current forensic tools, the most relevant issues, the upcoming challenges, and suggest future directions for research.},

So far, the research on machine learning applications in museums is mostly limited to art authentication, guiding and virtual reality. Yet, machine learning has powerful methods to extract information from any type of data and therefore there are other interesting applications which can have a significant effect on museum experience. The current work is an attempt to find an abstract and yet elaborate view into the existing machine learning applications in museums in general and automatic guide methods in particular. To do so, applications are grouped into different categories and for each category the usefulness of applying machine learning along with the existing methods, if any, are presented. Furthermore, a precise explanation on new directions accompanied by examples is provided. We expect this paper to be of interest to the machine learning researchers since it provides a guideline to proper directions of research in this realm.},

abstract={Underwater sensor networks (UWSN) provide a promising solution for several aquatic applications. Mobile UWSNs are vulnerable to various threats because of their harsh environment, acoustic communication channel, bandwidth limitation, high propagation delay, multipath effect, and mobility. Therefore, appropriate security mechanisms should be included in networking services, such as localization, to facilitate time critical applications. In this paper, we discuss various Denial-of-Service attacks in mobile UWSNs. We simulated a flooding attack and an out-of-coverage problem caused by mobility by using Aqua-Sim, and analyzed their impact on UWSN performance. In addition, we surveyed UWSN localization techniques and secure localization schemes of terrestrial wireless sensor networks (WSN). Simulation experiments were conducted to analyze the performance variation between mobile UWSNs and mobile WSNs. The study concluded that the variation in the network performance of mobile UWSNs varies from that of WSNs. Therefore, the security mechanisms proposed for terrestrial WSNs are unsuitable for UWSNs.},

DoS attack is a severe as it prevents legitimate users from accessing to their authorised services. Monitoring, Detection, and rehabilitation (MrDR) method is proposed to detect DoS attacks. MrDR method is based on calculating different trust values as nodes can be trusted or not. In this paper, we evaluate the MrDR method which detect DoS attacks in MANET and compare it with existing method Trust Enhanced Anonymous on-demand routing Protocol (TEAP) which is also based on trust concept. We consider two factors to compare the performance of the proposed method to TEAP method: packet delivery ratio and network overhead. The results confirm that the MrDR method performs better in network performance compared to TEAP method.},

abstract={The primary objective of Concealed Data Aggregation (CDA) is to preserve privacy while performing enroute data aggregation. Privacy Homomorphism (PH) techniques facilitate the development of concealed data aggregation protocols that enable end-to-end encryption in wireless sensor networks. Nevertheless, these protocols do not satisfy other security requirements such as integrity, authentication and data freshness and are vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we propose the novel Intrusion Resilient Concealed Data Aggregation (IRCDA) protocol for secure in-network data aggregation. This protocol employs privacy homomorphism techniques to achieve data privacy and combines them with homomorphic digital signatures to protect the integrity of the aggregated result. In addition, the proposed approach is resilient against node compromise attacks, an attack that devastates the function of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Security analysis and performance evaluation show that ours is the first work which remains secure even after compromising many sensor nodes and base station though not simultaneously. It completely mitigates the harmful effect caused by key exposure. Moreover, our protocol incurs very less communication overhead with slight increase in computation which is negligible when compared to communication cost and thereby it prolongs the lifetime of the network. The results prove that IRCDA performs better than most of the existing techniques in providing security to the process of data aggregation.},

abstract={In an untrusted Internet environment, there is a large amount of user privacy information being vulnerable to various attacks, and it is an important security concern for users on how to protect their privacy, and to further provide the anonymity guarantee. Recently, most privacy-sensitive users prefer anonymous communication to protect their private information from eavesdropping by attackers. Each user has different privacy protection demands for anonymous communication. However, anonymous communication methods cannot meet the various anonymity needs of users. Hence, the user on-demand anonymous communication is proposed, which can dynamically adjust the anonymity level according to a user's anonymity needs. However, the defense capabilities against attacks are insufficient in the existing user on-demand anonymous communication. Some malicious users in the network employ anonymous communication to hide their identities and attack the Internet. Moreover, the existing user on-demand anonymous communication is weak against traffic classification attacks based on machine learning. Therefore, this paper investigates its progresses and defects in privacy protection and network security. User on-demand anonymous communication is mainly composed of the user side and the transmission side. We separately investigate privacy protection and network security of user on-demand anonymous communication from the user side and the transmission side. By surveying various identity anonymity of users on the user side and the hierarchical anonymous transmission on the transmission side, we find two kinds of serious attacks in user on-demand anonymous communication, i.e., abuse of anonymous communication and traffic classification attacks based on machine learning. To solve the above security issues, we suggest the balancing mechanism of anonymous communication and behavior tracking which is used to prevent anonymous abuse, and the secure defense mechanism which is used to resist traffic classification attacks. To inspire follow-up research, we identify some open problems and emphasize future trends concerning user on-demand anonymous communication.},

abstract={We propose a novel method for detecting horizontal vanishing points and the zenith vanishing point in man-made environments. The dominant trend in existing methods is to first find candidate vanishing points, then remove outliers by enforcing mutual orthogonality. Our method reverses this process: we propose a set of horizon line candidates and score each based on the vanishing points it contains. A key element of our approach is the use of global image context, extracted with a deep convolutional network, to constrain the set of candidates under consideration. Our method does not make a Manhattan-world assumption and can operate effectively on scenes with only a single horizontal vanishing point. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets and achieve state-of the-art performance on each. In addition, our approach is significantly faster than the previous best method.},

abstract={The controller is an indispensable entity in software-defined networking (SDN), as it maintains a global view of the underlying network. However, if the controller fails to respond to the network due to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Then, the attacker takes charge of the whole network via launching a spoof controller and can also modify the flow tables. Hence, faster, and accurate detection of DDoS attacks against the controller will make the SDN reliable and secure. Moreover, the Internet traffic is drastically increasing due to unprecedented growth of connected devices. Consequently, the processing of large number of requests cause a performance bottleneck regarding SDN controller. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control plane SDN architecture for multi-domain communication that uses a statistical method called principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the big data traffic and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed to detect a DDoS attack. SVM has high accuracy and less false positive rate while the PCA filters attribute drastically. Consequently, the performance of classification and accuracy is improved while the false positive rate is reduced.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT), which enables a wide variety of embedded devices, sensors, and actuators (known as smart things) to interconnect and exchange data, is a promising network scenario for bridging physical devices and virtual objects in the cyber world. Considering the limited capacity of smart things, cloud computing has been introduced to store and process the huge amount of data collected by the IoT. The appropriate integration of cloud computing and the IoT can be regarded as the best of two worlds, simultaneously providing omnipresent sensing services and powerful processing capabilities. Undoubtedly, the cloud-assisted IoT will boost the advancement of innovative applications and services including smart cities, industrial IoT, intelligent transportation, and electronic health systems. Despite the benefits of cloud-aided IoT, it is impossible to overlook the significance of security and privacy in this kind of highly heterogeneous and interconnected system. To deal with security threats to smart devices and sensitive data, hundreds of security solutions have recently been put forward for either the cloud or IoT environments. However, a few important characteristics such as heterogeneity and scalability have not been properly considered in these solutions.},

abstract={The articles in this special section focus on vehicular networks in the era of 6G mobile communication. With the growth of the vehicle population, vehicular networks play a key role in building safe, efficient, and intelligent transport systems and has been attracting a lot of attention from both academic and industrial communities around the world. The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile applications, e.g., real-time video analytic, image-aided navigation, natural language processing, and etc, have brought tremendous pressure on current vehicular networks, e.g., high bandwidth, ultra-low latency, high reliability, high security, powerful computation capability, and massive connections. It is necessary to continue to develop vehicular networks by combining the latest research intends in other fields to meet quickly rising communication and computation demands. The upcoming 6G technology, which provides Holographic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled communications, together with the increasing implementation of artificial intelligence in mobile devices, will lead to a new research trend to end-edge-cloud orchestrated computing with intelligence. It means that, not only the intelligent communication protocols, but also the intelligent computing resource management and machine learning algorithms among the mobile vehicles, the edge and the cloud, should be redesigned to support the development of vehicular networks.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of mobile computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), in which billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. However, it is challenging and infeasible to transfer and process zillions bytes of data using the current cloud-device architecture, due to bandwidth constraints of networks, potentially uncontrollable latency of cloud services, and privacy concerns while collecting data from IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, edge computing, an emerging computing paradigm, has received a tremendous amount of interest. By pushing data storage, computing, and controls closer to the network edge, edge computing has been widely recognized as a promising solution to meet the requirements of low latency, high scalability, and energy efficiency, as well as to mitigate the network traffic burdens. However, with the emergence of diverse IoT applications (e.g., smart city, industrial automation, and connected car), it becomes challenging for edge computing to deal with these heterogeneous IoT environments.},

year={2018},
volume={3},

pages={57-78},
abstract={Ubiquitous computing facilitated by Internet of things (IoT) devices has made modern day life easier across many areas. It offers capabilities to measure parameters associated with the devices, to infer from their results, and to understand and control millions of such devices in various application domains. The enormous potential of IoT systems enables each and every device to communicate with each other, thereby providing more productivity. In this scenario, heterogeneity of technologies in use is expected to intensify the security threats. Policy enforcement for the assurance of privacy and security plays a key role in these systems. Fulfillment of privacy and security related requirements include confidentiality of data, user and device authentication, access control, and trust assurance among the things. However, recent reported events related to security attacks show colossal vulnerabilities among IoT devices capable of bringing security risks to the whole environment. One of the common uses of these devices by the attackers is to generate powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. It is one of the most prominent attacking behaviors over a network by a group of geographically distributed zombie computers that interrupt and block legitimate users to use the network resources and hence, requires great attention. In this regard, the current work being novel in the field puts concentration on variants of DDoS attacks and their impact on IoT networks along with some of the existing countermeasures to defend against these attacks. The paper also discusses the detailed working mechanism of these attacks and highlights some of the commonly used tools that are deployed in such attack scenarios.},
